The text above is original data from a freeCodeCamp file dump of a .JSON database.

This is an automatically added comment by a parsing app written in JavaScript by Markus Isaksson. The parser has taken a .JSON database file of a freeCodeCamp profile and removed some data. This is a summary of what has been removed:

3388 instances of references to completed shorter step-by-step programming exercises were removed.

The original file also contained submitted code, which has been kept intact.

20 instances of HTML code were processed.
20 instances of CSS code were processed.
10 instances of JavaScript code were processed.
10 instances of Python code were processed. Python code is inserted twice in the original database, so this represents 5 unique occurrences as long as the same structure of the original database files is used.
0 instances of other types of code were processed.
