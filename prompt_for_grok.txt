Analyze the following Python-based educational language learning application codebase and suggest specific improvements for functionality, code quality, user experience, and scalability. The project includes:

- A main Flask app in `C:\Users\mjisa\dev\app` with tools for CEFR analysis, argument visualization, source criticism, text modification, and exam simulation. It has student/teacher dashboards, AI modules, and uses SQLite.

- A separate kallkritik-generator in `C:\Users\mjisa\dev\kallkritik-generator` (simple Flask app).

- Standalone scripts: `text_modifier.py` (simulates LLM-based text adaptation for CEFR levels with a Flask API) and `run.py` (app runner).

Key files to review: app structure, tools/ directory, routes/, templates/, and the text modifier simulation. Focus on integrating real AI/LLMs, enhancing UI/UX, adding robust testing, improving security, and optimizing performance. Provide actionable code changes or architectural recommendations.
