# Gravity Ghosts

A real-time local-multiplayer browser game built with pure HTML5 + Canvas in under 600 lines.

**Core mechanic:** *Temporal Resonance* – when gravitons collide they permanently steal each other's "memories" (color + past positions), creating an ever-evolving web of shared history.

- WASD to control your golden graviton  
- Collide to steal memories  
- Watch the canvas turn into living art

Created 100% locally using Ollama + llama3.2 + custom game-architect persona on November 19, 2025.
