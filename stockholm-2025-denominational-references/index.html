        Given the evolving nature of the manifest.json content in the repository, here’s an open-ended approach to leveraging and contributing structured data for upcoming research and reference purposes:

***

## How to Use and Contribute to manifest.json Iterations

- **Expect Evolving Structure:** Treat manifest.json files as living documents whose fields, resource links, and metadata are flexible depending on ongoing research needs. Description, resource, and statistical fields can be expanded or refined without risk of breaking global usage.
- **Interpret Fields Generously:** Fields like `"resources"` (array of objects), `"description"` (string), `"percentage_of_global_christians"` (number), and `"denomination"` (string) are expected and accepted, but you can add contextual or event-specific fields (e.g., `"local_use_cases"`, `"key_contacts"`, `"related_events"`) when needed.
- **Metadata Link Formats:** The repository can reference other .json files following the pattern of the URLs you listed above. For event metadata and transcripts, use clean, descriptive filenames and predictable folder structures to keep information traceable.

### Example Data Structure for Manifest Usage

This is a general template that supports both denominational reference and event cross-linking:

```json
{
  "denomination": "Example Denomination",
  "percentage_of_global_christians": 10.1,
  "description": "A brief overview of this denomination.",
  "resources": [
    { "name": "Official Denomination Site", "url": "https://..." },
    { "name": "Comparative Study", "url": "https://MarkusIsaksson1982.github.io/comparative-analyses/cos-akk" }
  ],
  "related_events": [
    { "name": "2025 National Prayer Breakfast", "metadata": "https://MarkusIsaksson1982.github.io/USPA-AI/2025-02-06-national-prayer-breakfast/metadata.json" },
    { "name": "2025 Catholic Prayer Breakfast", "metadata": "https://MarkusIsaksson1982.github.io/2025-02-28-catholic-prayer-breakfast/metadata.json" }
  ]
}
```

- **Extendability:** You can expand with `"transcripts"`, `"key_figures"`, `"historical_context"` or `"local_adaptation"` as required.
- **Cross-linking Events:** For events with both metadata and transcript files (as in your examples), reference both to support deep dives and comparative research.
- **Localization Support:** When adapting for “localized research purposes,” add `"language"`, `"region"`, or `"demographic_notes"` fields as you need for Sweden- or globally-focused denominational manifests.

### Contribution and Parsing Tips

- **Flexible Parsing:** When reading manifest.json files, assume partial and provisional data. Prepare to gracefully handle missing, extra, or evolving fields.
- **Programmatic Iteration:** If scripting or automating analysis, use robust JSON parsing that navigates nested or variably present fields, e.g. Python’s `.get()` or JavaScript’s optional chaining.
- **Referential Approach:** Where you see references like `"metadata"` pointing to other .json files, follow these links for in-depth data. For future prompts, you can request or parse contextual links (programs, transcripts, analysis).

## Ready for Future Iterations & Research

All suggestions encourage a flexible, open-ended approach—whether populating new manifest.json files, cross-referencing events, or integrating additional folders and files for evolving research needs. Any manifest content will be parsed contextually and interpreted with adaptability in future questions, without assumptions of strict schema permanence. This will allow for productive, iterative, and tailored research in subsequent repository updates.
