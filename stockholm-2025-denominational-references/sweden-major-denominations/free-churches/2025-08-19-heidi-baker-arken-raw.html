 It's nice to be on a track.
 Let's get started.
 Hello!
 It's so nice that you have found your way here.
 Welcome to Mirakelfestivalen Saturday evening.
 This is your evening.
 This is your evening. You are going to meet Jesus.
 But it is also Jesus' evening.
 Because our greatest wish is to exalt him.
 That he will be visible here tonight.
 So if you want, you can get up and start praising the Lord.
 Let us lift a hallelujah.
 I raise a voice, praise our God.
 Louder than the unbelief.
 I raise a hallelujah.
 My weapon is a melody.
 Oh, I raise a hallelujah.
 Oh, heaven comes to fight for me.
 I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm.
 Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar.
 Up from the ashes, hope will arise.
 Death is defeated, the King is alive.
 I raise a hallelujah.
 In the presence of my enemies.
 I raise a hallelujah.
 Louder, louder than the unbelief.
 I raise a hallelujah.
 My weapon is a melody.
 I raise a hallelujah.
 Oh, heaven comes to fight for me.
 I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm.
 Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar.
 Up from the ashes, hope will arise.
 Death is defeated, the King is alive.
 I raise a hallelujah.
 With everything inside of me.
 I raise a hallelujah.
 I will watch the darkness flee.
 I raise a hallelujah.
 In the middle of the mystery.
 I raise a hallelujah.
 Oh, may you lost your hold on me.
 I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm.
 Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar.
 Up from the ashes, hope will arise.
 Death is defeated, the King is alive.
 I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm.
 Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar.
 Up from the ashes, hope will arise.
 Death is defeated, the King is alive.
 Sing a little louder.
 Sing a little louder.
 In the press and all my enemies.
 Sing a little louder.
 Louder than the infinity.
 Sing a little louder.
 My weapon is a melody.
 Sing a little louder.
 There comes the fight for me.
 I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm.
 Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar.
 Up from the ashes, hope will arise.
 Death is defeated, the King is alive.
 I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm.
 Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar.
 Up from the ashes, hope will arise.
 Death is defeated, the King is alive.
 I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm.
 Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar.
 Up from the ashes, hope will arise.
 Death is defeated, the King is alive.

 Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar.
 Up from the ashes, hope will arise.
 Death is defeated, the King is alive.
 Death is defeated, the King is alive.
 Death is defeated, the King is alive.

 Day and night, night and day
 Let incense arise
 Day and night, night and day
 Let incense arise
 Day and night, night and day
 Let incense arise
 Day and night, night and day
 Let incense arise
 Day and night, night and day
 Let incense arise
 Day and night, night and day, let incense arise
 Day and night, night and day, let incense arise
 Day and night, night and day, let incense arise

 Day and night, night and day, let incense arise
 And we honor you, Jesus, we love you
 Let incense arise

 Day and night, night and day, let incense arise
 We honor you, Jesus, we love you
 We love you, Jesus, you are the love of our hearts
 And we want to come to you tonight with an open heart to love you
 Because we know that you place your dreams in our hearts
 So your tears will be our tears and your joy will be our joy
 So come Holy Spirit and calm every soul now
 So that there will be a place for you to meet
 Because we are here, Jesus, to love you
 To get in touch with your heart and your eyes
 But also your name in a love community with you
 So we want to serve you with a driving force that is heavenly love
 So come Holy Spirit and let everyone who is here for the first time
 To come in a deep, deep rest and relaxation
 So that they can open up to your love
 To your love
 We take a song and we go into the prayer and we silence down
 And then we let the smorgasbord flow into our lives
 Because we are here and you are here to meet Jesus
 And maybe some of you are here for the first time on the ark
 And I just want to say that here we have given you a complete freedom
 For the Holy Spirit to work
 And if you notice that the Spirit works in you so that you will cry
 Then you open up to that
 If you feel that the Spirit works so that you just want to laugh or laugh
 Then you do that
 Will the Holy Spirit work so that you fall to the floor, remain
 And let the Lord operate you or touch you in the way he longs for
 And then we wish that it will be a breath of salvation
 So that we can really love the Lord
 So that his dreams become our dreams
 Because sometimes we ask like this
 What is the will of my life
 But his will for your life is in his heart
 And maybe tonight he will plant something beautiful in you
 So that you together with him can answer and make this world a better world
 This nice boy now who praises he will die tomorrow
 Is beautiful out here
 So let us go into the prayer and then Oscar, Oscar, Oscar, Oscar
 I want my special song every night
 No more night
 But we go into the prayer now and just love Jesus
 Just love Jesus
 You have to sit down, you have to stand and feel free on the ark
 Won't you let this be a sacrifice
 Let me dedicate my life to worship you
 Won't you let this be a sacrifice
 Let me dedicate my life to worship you
 I'm a lover of your presence

 you.

 Oooooh Thank you Jesus.
 Det är en sång som har nästan varit
 ett tema under den här konferensen
 och det är ...
 no more nice.
 Vi kan bara sitta ner och jag
 ber Oscar sjunga den.
 För det här temat för den här
 konferensen än väntar påviousgommen.
 And to be able to repeat it we need an eternal perspective.
 We need to see that life is going pretty fast.
 We are pilgrims here and we connect to eternity.
 So, Oskar, are you ready?
 This song is apparently prophetic.
 So listen and draw in God's heart.
 We will give a lot of time to Haydn this evening as well.
 But it's Saturday evening.
 And this is the 27th meeting, you know.
 So we have 29 meetings.
 And for me it feels like I could have 29 more meetings.
 Therefore it has been so wonderful, so deep, so lovely.
 It has gone from 110 km per hour to 0 km from wheelchairs.
 We have flowed in the holy spirit to powerful evangelists
 who have spoken about reaching the world with hundreds of thousands of people.
 And we have received such a variety of various services.
 And I feel that tonight you will also receive a bit of God's heart through Haydn Baker.
 But now, Oskar, please.
 Heaven will pass away
 It's not a dream
 God will make all things new that day
 And God is the curse from which I stumbled and fell
 Evil is banished to eternal hell
 No more night
 No more pain
 No more tears
 Never crying again
 Embraces to the great I am
 We live in the light of the recently
 See all around
 All the nations bow down to sing
 The only sound is the praises to Christ our King
 So only the names from the books are read
 I know the King
 So there's no need to dread
 And no more night
 No more pain
 No more tears
 Never crying again
 Embraces to the great I am
 We live in the light of the recently
 See over there
 There's a mansion
 All that's prepared just for me
 Where I will live with my Savior eternally
 And there will be no more night
 And no more pain
 Never crying again
 Embraces to the great I am
 We live in the light of the recently
 Embraces to the great I am
 We gonna live in the light of the recently
 The recently
 Praise the Lord
 Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
 Can you come and pray, come and pray, come and pray
 Thank you Jesus
 Now we lift all the pre-ordained subjects, Jesus and all needs
 And we come before your face Jesus
 Put your wounded hands on the banns
 Move every human heart tonight
 Because now we live for eternity and we carry eternity in our hearts
 And therefore we make new priorities and new steps
 And sit at your feet and just love you
 Then come the holy beautiful wonderful others
 And then you move each one and let them see Jesus
 In the name of Jesus, Amen
 Amen
 Then I would like to say welcome
 We will give much space to Haydn but I have a little listening
 I want to hear first, is there anyone here for the very first time in the ark?
 Then you will get a book, it's not our whole life
 We are soon to celebrate our 40th anniversary
 But it is at least 30 years with funny pictures through the years
 And if you would like to know more about the Ark meeting
 Then we have a vision session tomorrow at 9 o'clock in the office
 And if you are a doping candidate, then it is also 9 o'clock in the office
 Then you get a towel and a doping suit
 And then you will have to go down to Lillshön after the morning meeting
 And get duped there
 So it's 9 o'clock in the office building
 I feel really, really welcome
 We are so happy that Haydn is here
 Two years ago we were in Nazareth and got a blessing in the Holy Spirit
 And we have served over 200 Arab women
 And we love each other
 We have the same longing, so God's closeness, God's closeness, smudging, smudging, God's glory
 And it's been quite a few years since Haydn was here for the first time
 And then we had a big women's conference
 And then you have been here, I think, a few times, also together with your husband
 And we are connected in the spirit
 There is something in this
 That we long for God's closeness, isn't it?
 There is this longing
 And I said today, or my husband and I, we were so happy, we were so fun
 We had so nice yesterday too
 There was Calle Severin here with Månek and we have a very long history
 We are since 1981
 But it was like everything disappeared
 We haven't met for several years
 Everything disappeared
 And this is something that God is doing now
 He is
 And I thought, this is going to be heavenly friends, you know?
 Then we are going to drink heavenly coffee and tell about our journey
 It's going to be so good, so good, so good
 So I felt such an incredible gratitude
 To be able to serve the Lord on this place too
 That I have been able to hold out for so many years to prepare a place for Jesus
 I thought you would be able to see very quickly now
 A little short from the Bible school
 We start here in 1987 with 200 students
 We have held out
 And we continue now in the autumn, in September
 And I think this will be the best year
 Because I think at least the best
 So please show these pictures
 That we have done in order for the Bible school
 Here you can see some of the students
 In 1987 they came from Norway in great shock
 And from Finland
 And then there were students from Iceland and Denmark
 From all over the world
 And this Bible school is very special
 You can change our picture
 You can go on the training line for 1-3 years
 The training line has no lessons
 And then you have to be at Jesus feet
 For us this Bible school is not about being a doctor in theology
 It is about getting to know Jesus
 And sit at Jesus feet
 So when we hear God's word in the confession
 We get a love relationship with Jesus
 And we get a hold of the healing
 The full-fledged work
 Stand on God's word
 And flow in the spirit and spirit's gifts
 The vision on the ark is to strengthen the weak
 To heal the sick
 And to connect them to the broken hearts
 And it is needed more than ever in this time
 And to flow in the mercy
 The mercy of love
 Which is in a completely different way
 Than being friendly and kind
 It is for things to be put down in their lives
 So Jesus will have space
 To continue his healing service
 In this wounded world
 So hurry up and apply
 We like young people
 We like all ages
 It is not a youth Bible school
 But it is not a youth home either
 But it is
 I like to see all ages
 Flow together
 And collaborate
 Love Jesus
 That is what we want to see in this Bible school
 Because the congregation is needed of course
 But God needs mothers and fathers
 Siblings and brothers
 Because we are also a ruthless generation
 That comes
 And that is why I inspire you
 When you are looking for a Bible school
 You will never regret it
 I have been a Bible teacher for 45 years
 I came to the Mam church yesterday
 And it had been a year
 And then I was a Bible teacher for 3 years
 And here I have been for almost 40 years
 So then I understand that I love God's word
 And then you get to share our life
 How do you keep the smorgasbord?
 Do you have to sell your house when you are 70?
 Do you have to buy a flat in Spain?
 Or can you burn together with God?
 And I feel that my mission is the nations
 To have the years ahead
 To bring students to many different countries
 All over the world
 So apply
 To the Bible school
 And to the youth
 And then I thought
 We have a lovely girl now
 So you can come up and do a short lecture
 About
 De Jennifer Cheder
 Who loves mission
 So then you get a few minutes
 I think it was nice to give me a few minutes
 Thanks Pastor Linda
 It is difficult to run a cat with Pastor Linda
 Because she is fast
 And she has felt God for a long time
 So now we young people come in
 And try to really keep the pace
 But it is difficult
 So you have to pray for us
 I was going to tell you something
 Very touching
 You can take the first picture
 Already now
 This song is called No More Night
 One day it will come
 The day when we will no longer have
 Night and darkness
 When there is only joy
 No tears
 But that day is not here yet
 And we need to do something now
 So I wanted to tell you a short story
 About fatherhood
 Because that is what I am concerned about
 Mission is the best thing I have done
 In my life
 And to become a father
 It fills a place in the heart
 That nothing else can do
 Because you reach out your hand
 To those who need you
 And it is so important
 Because what we have done
 For one of these
 My least
 We have also done for Jesus
 That is what he said
 So the children you saw in the picture
 They have gone from a total misery
 To a new life
 The girl loves to go to school
 Her name is Sharon
 She survived a rape attempt
 And has a legacy
 From knee to toe
 In this rape attempt
 And today she is becoming a young woman
 With many dreams and visions
 Thanks to the fact that she has been able to
 Come to a orphanage where she is loved
 And the boy also wants to start a orphanage
 His name is Brian
 He also comes from a terrible background
 On the streets of Kampala
 And he wants to start a orphanage
 So it changes life
 To be a father
 There are ways out for people
 Who are in such situations
 You can see the rest of the pictures
 Until the last picture
 There we see the
 Philippines
 And it continues in many countries
 And during the years we have had
 To do fantastic things
 I have heard a lot about it
 So we are happy
 So it will go around lists
 That the world of meetings sends around
 So take the step today and be a father
 100 crowns per month
 200 crowns per month
 It changes life
 So don't be afraid to be
 Also decisive
 And not just the recipient
 There are also these
 To get you a tree
 It is also good to stretch out your hand
 If you want a blue sheet
 Then it is more about the mission work
 And you can also be a father
 By writing to us or filling in the blue sheet
 That was what I wanted to say
 Thank you Jesus
 It is so wonderful to see
 How God puts down love to the child
 And I have seen it in your heart again
 You are burning with love
 And the rest of your life
 I have seen it
 Thank you Jesus
 Thank you Jennifer
 Yes, we only have a short visit
 With you Haide
 Very short visit
 Tomorrow is the last meeting
 It is only two meetings
 But it is at 15 o'clock tomorrow
 And at 10.30 o'clock
 I will be teaching
 And flow in the holy spirit
 So it will be like two meetings tomorrow
 Then we have reached the 29th meeting
 And I feel so incredibly grateful
 I thought it is a really good feeling
 To feel grateful
 I was so grateful
 I was grateful
 For being able to love Jesus
 Follow Jesus
 To live in the holy spirit
 I feel so incredibly grateful
 Now I have a friend here
 Who is called Patrik Sandberg
 I don't know where you are
 Ok
 Now Patrik you have two minutes
 This is my husband Patrik
 And
 We will have
 Together with many Christians
 We will have something called
 Sweden supplicates Jesus
 Do you think it is time after 11 years
 Waiting for Jesus manifestation
 Do you think it is time
 That we come back into the public room
 So we give Jesus an applause
 I want to invite you
 To Sweden supplicates Jesus
 Saturday the 2nd of August
 At 13.00 to 22.00
 There are 60 meetings
 Organizations and the arch
 That we are here
 To come together
 Because supplicate Jesus
 Is 9 hours
 Look at your neighbor and laugh
 And say 9 hours
 We gather in the main room
 And we are here
 We gather in the capital
 In the heart of Sweden
 As a Christian movement
 To lift up
 The name Jesus publicly
 And it will be a whole day
 With a song in the center
 Hope for this nation will come
 Ulf Kristiansson
 He was so charged that
 Maybe new songs will come
 Mikke Finn will come
 Irene with team from Livets Org
 GK-Lovsong
 Shake your butt
 It will be a prayer
 And a conversation
 We will have prayers
 All the time
 So the lovsogna will be on a fire
 Of prayers
 It will be food trucks
 Organizations
 And mantras
 So come and be with us
 Join the cell group
 The youth group
 And come
 And if you are in a battle
 You will come to Sweden
 To ask Jesus
 When we come together
 We heard from the Dalarna
 That they will come in a train
 To come together
 So go in to svergetillbejesus.se
 Then you have all the information
 And if you want to give a gift
 Or help as a functionary
 You have the possibility to do that
 And Linda and I have been in
 The Jesus manifestation for many years
 And we have 25.000 people
 Who came
 Imagine if we could come today
 Will you pray for 20 seconds
 Before I hand over to Linda
 Pray for God's presence
 Raise your voice
 Stretch your hands
 To Jesus
 Father we just want to thank you
 Thank you for serving
 The people in our capital
 And now we pray
 That your love will touch
 The heart of Sweden
 The king's garden
 We pray for a growth
 We pray that we will come
 Young and old
 People from different nations
 We pray that your presence
 Will fall in the capital
 So people will be raised
 Fledged, whole
 So that people will meet each other
 We give you honor Jesus
 Let you be known
 We pray so in Jesus name
 Let's give him an applause
 For what he is going to do
 Amen
 Thank you, we actually worked
 For 8 years in the Jesus manifestation
 So it was a fantastic time
 To see so many Christians
 Coming from all over Sweden
 Now we are going to take up a gift
 Tomorrow we are going to take up
 A gift, other collect also to
 Ministry
 And it is really worth supporting
 So prepare for tomorrow
 And you can give in different ways
 We have the terminal down there
 So we don't have to stress
 We can sing the song for a while
 And then we also have swish
 So that you can go on swish
 You who are in Norway
 Are very happy if you are
 In the arches and Finland
 Then we have bank giro
 And we need that
 Now I see that there are many
 Who have come here
 Who are not usually in the arches
 But if you feel that you want
 To support the arches
 Then there is the possibility to be partners
 And partners are important for us
 Because then God can put the gifts
 In your hearts
 Because we are a place that will serve people
 We serve people
 Thousands of people every year
 And we also work in 15 countries
 With serving people
 And flow in the holy spirit
 And if you feel that this is what you
 Would like to help us with
 And support us in this
 Then we would be very very very
 Thankful
 Because we have no entrance tickets
 In the arches
 Sometimes someone was angry
 And said you are holding too long collections
 But we have no money
 Through politics
 We have no church tax
 We have no money from the municipality
 The only thing we get is people's love
 And that is why we want
 The gift to come from the heart
 Because this is what we do for Jesus
 We love Jesus
 And that is why we give
 So now you get the opportunity to give
 And if you want to give a promise
 So you might feel tonight
 I want to give 10,000
 Then you can write it on your promise
 And then you keep half
 And then you put the other
 In the collection
 And then we know that you will
 Pay for this at the right time
 And I have a place that is
 Together with the No More Night
 And that is for the Matthew's
 Gospel chapter 6
 Do not collect taxes on the earth
 Says Jesus
 In chapter 6 and 19
 For there will be
 Roast and paint
 And destroy
 And thunders and breaks
 And souls
 And there will be no
 Roast and paint
 And thunders and breaks
 And souls
 And there will be a heart
 And I think
 That we are connected
 Tonight with Jesus and heart
 You know I have been sick
 For a year but now thanks Jesus
 I have got my voice back
 But I have been without voice
 For almost a year
 And I learned that the tax
 Is the love of the living
 And I have seen more of my miracle
 During the hard times
 Because God said what do you have Linda
 I said I only have my hands
 And the oil bottles
 It is enough
 I have your hands
 And you have the oil bottles
 And I was invited to the
 Trosknistan
 And it went so terribly bad
 I had no voice
 Five minutes the voice was gone
 Then I chopped
 And I had so big economic needs
 Because I was going to invite a big group of Jews
 And I had not had time to collect
 Money because I had no voice
 And it was hard not to have
 A voice but the smear was there
 The handkerchief and the miracles
 And then I went in
 And I was going to tell the leaders
 That I can not preach because
 I have no voice
 And then I went in Trosknistan
 And an older man came
 And he whispered in my ear
 Linda do you need money for the Jews
 I did not say anything
 Do you need money for the Jews
 Yes I need money for the Jews
 I whispered with a cringy voice
 And he said how much do you need
 And I knew I needed a huge sum
 Because we pay all the trips
 And he said on Monday
 Linda, the money is in your pocket
 Are you happy
 So my friends
 We are going to be giving
 And love Jesus with our hearts
 There is something happening
 With our hearts when we give
 We are going to take a little bit
 Of the song
 And then we are going to let out
 Heidi in the choir
 To flow in the spirit
 And serve you and work with God
 In the spirit of Christmas
 We are very happy to have you here
 Heidi
 We really love to be here
 I love you Pastor
 I love you
 So please give us
 And we will flow with the Holy Spirit
 I am thirsty
 I come after you
 Jesus my joy
 I re-warn
 I am thirsty
 Your love's restoring
 My soul
 Now I'm yours
 And you are mine
 And from my heart
 The song will rise
 I love you
 So please give us
 And we will flow with the Holy Spirit
 I am thirsty
 I love you
 So please give us
 And we will flow with the Holy Spirit
 I am thirsty
 I love you
 I love you
 I love you
 I love you
 I love you
 I love you
 I love you
 I love you
 I love you
 And my heart
 Will follow
 Only after
 after you.

 love you, I love you and my heart will follow. Oh I love you, oh I love you!
 I love you, Lord.

 I love you, Lord.
 I love you, Lord.
 My heart will follow you.
 My heart will follow you.
 And my heart will follow only after you.
 And my heart will follow you.
 And my heart will follow only after you.
 I feel that we should just take this moment to love Jesus.
 Give Him the Holy Spirit.
 Thank Him for His goodness, for His love, for His life that He has given us.
 We love you, Jesus.
 We love you, we are here for you. Keep playing, Kari.
 We praise and thank you, Jesus, for Your goodness, Your love, Your grace, Your life.
 You have given us so much, Jesus.
 We love you, Jesus, for what You have done.
 We give our lives to You.
 We love you, Jesus.

 Honor and honor.
 You are so worthy Lord.
 God take us deep today Lord.
 God we want to go further than we have ever been.
 We want to go deeper than we have ever been.
 God we thank you for your healing power.
 We thank you for your glory now.
 We thank you Father for the leaders of this place.
 We thank you Linda, her team.
 We thank you God for those who have come.
 Thank you for Rebecca Lord.
 Just a friendship and kindness Lord.
 Thank you for Matilda and Solomon.
 I thank you for yourself Lord.
 Most of all I'm just so grateful.
 I'm so grateful for you.
 I'm so grateful for the body of Christ.
 I ask you to take us Lord to a place.
 Where we're so deep in you God.
 That you drowned us.
 That we completely die.
 We completely die.
 And we are raised up with you.
 In heavenly places.
 God oh God I ask that.
 I'll just do all the phrase.
 I just ask that the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart would be pleasing unto you.
 I thank you that Oscar and I are going to minister to you.
 I thank you that Oscar and I are going to minister together with your anointing Lord.
 Oh Jesus.
 How in love I am.
 Oh I'm so in love with you Jesus.
 Thank you Lord.
 Thank you Jesus.
 Oh I'm just so in love with him.
 Are you so in love with him?
 I heard you had something like 29 meetings.
 In what? In a week?
 In 10 days.
 That sounds like our life.
 And we're still happy.
 That's a while.
 Why are we happy?
 Why? I have a question. I'm going to ask a question.
 I'm going to ask questions tonight.
 We love Jesus.
 We love Jesus.
 The joy of the Lord is our strength.
 And he gives us incredible joy.
 And it just keeps on getting better, our love and our relationship with him.
 And I felt a little tap. Rebecca is amazing. She's a dear friend. She came with me.
 Super anointed. Stand up. Stand up.
 So if she lays hands on you, you're going to be blessed.
 I felt this little tap.
 And she said, oh hi guys, you came here too.
 Wonderful. So she tapped me and she said, they said whenever you're ready.
 We're worshipping so you could tap me like 25 times.
 We're going to keep worshipping.
 I did have a funny meeting. It was a wonderful meeting. I don't know if it was funny, but it was.
 I just thought I don't want to break my other foot so I'll tie my shoe.
 I don't want to break my other foot so I'm going to tie my shoe.
 That would be rough if you had two feet.
 So I was in this meeting and it was just glory, glory, glory.
 And the lady who was leading it, there was a lady who was kind of leading it.
 But she wasn't leading it. Holy Spirit was leading it.
 And she said, so it started at 2 o'clock.
 Don't get nervous about tomorrow now when you hear this.
 But she tapped me, she told me very clearly we could worship as long as we wanted.
 And about 11.30 at night I felt this tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
 And about 11.30 at night I felt this tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
 And I was just in the glory. I didn't want to stop worshipping.
 11.30 at night, which I didn't know what time it was, just lost in worship.
 I took her words literally, you see.
 She said, aren't you going to preach?
 Well you said, you said.
 We could worship as long as we liked.
 But I still remember I got a word from Exodus 33.
 So it is word and spirit.
 But when we are really deep in the presence, then the word comes alive.
 Right? Does it come alive?
 So we just want God to crash in, break in on us.
 And so whatever he wants to do, we just want him to do.
 And I have a scripture, I was praying about what to share.
 And I was going between different places.
 I'm thinking, I don't know how Matilda, she got here before us, I think.
 We flew and she drove and she's here. She's an amazing leader of a movement. Full of Jesus.
 I don't know why, we had to get up and force something and then we flew.
 It was a weird way to fly.
 Did we go to Germany? Finland first?
 We flew via Finland.
 We went to Finland, then we came here from Gothenburg.
 I was like, what is that?
 But it's wonderful because we're with the beautiful body of Christ.
 It's so beautiful to be with you here tonight.
 Yes, thank you Jesus. That's all I've got. Thank you Jesus.
 I've always caught up. Thank you Jesus.
 So listen to this. This is 1 John 2.
 Listen to this from 1 John 1, chapter 2.
 Thank you for that monitor. It's such a gift.
 As you, I'm going to wait a minute.
 I'm going to read from this second part of it.
 And his anointing teaches you about all things.
 And as this anointing is real, not counterfeit, just as it has taught you, remain in him.
 Which verse was that?
 It's 1 John 2, the second half of 27.
 Oh yes. So 1 John 2, chapter 2.
 And verse 27, the second half.
 His anointing teaches you about all things.
 And as this anointing is real, not counterfeit, just as it has taught you, remain in him.
 And that's something we really, really want to do, remain in him.
 If we remain in him, we stay full of his presence all the days of our lives.
 And we really, this is great news.
 Hi, you can't tell you guys are rocking it.
 I want to go hug them all. I'll do it later.
 They drove from, God burger, maybe they live here. I don't know.
 Here they are again. That's awesome.
 Hunger touches our hearts.
 So the anointing of the Lord.
 We need his anointing.
 And when his anointing breaks in, we're drawn into his heart.
 And then he says, stay.
 He says, stay.
 And then he says, I'm going to go to the temple.
 And then he says, I'm going to go to the temple.
 And then he says, I'm going to go to the temple.
 And then he says, stay.
 He says, stay.
 Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
 Don't go away from it, stay in it.
 We were having a lovely conversation before.
 We were talking about how the Lord missed you.
 And you were talking about how God had missed you.
 And he said, where are you?
 See, he wants us.
 And he wants us to be with him even more than we think we want to be with him.
 Do you really want him?
 He wants you more.
 You want him?
 He wants you more.
 And he's not a miserly God.
 A miserly, he's not cheap.
 He doesn't just give you gruel, he wants to give you himself.
 You know that story, do you ever see that story about the orphan?
 You know the name of the orphan.
 Oliver.
 Yeah, that's not you.
 Definitely not you.
 And in this story, this orphan was just begging for a little gruel.
 A little bit of sauce, a little bit of food.
 A miserable bit of food.
 And the orphan master just said, no, no more.
 Work, work, work, work, work, work.
 No, work, work.
 Some of us think fathers like that.
 That God's like that.
 And we think we just have to beg him for a little bit, a tiny bit, a little drop.
 And I don't think this fellowship's like that at all.
 But there was something about this story that touched me as a little mama
 who took care of the orphan children.
 When children first come in, they eat way too much.
 They just eat and eat and eat and eat.
 I have a dog like that.
 I have two dogs, they're both labradors.
 The one is the mama, and the other one is the daughter.
 And the mama's kind of skinny.
 Because the daughter wants all the food.
 And so I live in Mozambique.
 That's where I lived. We've been there 30 years.
 And I have been on the most extraordinary adventures you can ever imagine.
 Really, seriously.
 I've been around the world, around, around.
 I've also been beaten and stoned and knifed and shot at and thrown in jail and a few things like that.
 But the way I broke my foot is my fat dog.
 My fat dog just wanted food and she just pushed me out of the way.
 She just took her big old bottom and pushed me right on down. There I fell.
 I broke my foot.
 I thought, wow, this is not a very exciting way to break your foot.
 Not that any way is great to break your foot.
 But I'm thinking about how in this realm of the spirit and in the church sometimes.
 That we could be a little bit like my fat dog.
 In the sense that we think we've got to push, we've got to put somebody else down, we've got to shove somebody else out of the way in order to get what's ours.
 Because we think we need to push, we need to push somebody else out of the way and push somebody down in order to get what's ours.
 But the kingdom doesn't work like that.
 We all have full access.
 We have full access!
 It's not just a little bit of food.
 We have Jesus, he's our feast.
 He's our bread, he's our life.
 And every day he says, I'm here for you, fresh, fresh, fresh.
 I'm going to trade places with you because of this.
 I forgave my dog if you're worried about the inner healing, but I forgave Mimi.
 Mimi's forgiven.
 Thank you Jesus.
 I love that the Lord looks at us as his children and he says, I want to give you.
 I want to give you.
 I want to give you myself.
 I want to hold you, love you, encourage you.
 I want to bless you.
 And if I bless you, I can bless her too.
 If I bless her, I can bless him.
 A story that's coming to my mind right now is an impression that I had.
 And it was kind of a strange impression.
 And what I saw was, in this impression, I saw a long, long, long, long, long table.
 And this table had no beginning and it had no end.
 It just went on and on and on and on.
 And there in this impression I had a beautiful impression of Abba Daddy God.
 And you know he can do anything, right?
 Are we all on the same page?
 He can literally do anything.
 So in this impression he just walked through the table.
 Now on the table was every kind of food.
 It was a feast.
 It was the most beautiful feast.
 And he walked just right through the table.
 And can you come up here just for a minute?
 Thank you.
 And he took, yeah that's nice, you're very encouraging around here.
 I like, so he took the first one.
 And he took him by the shoulders.
 And he looked him in the eye.
 And he said, you're my favorite.
 I was like, wow! That's amazing!
 But before I saw that, I saw believers.
 Believers, like this is a believers meeting.
 And they were running on the ground like little rats.
 And they were taking little bits of food.
 And it was like they were just taking little bits of food and they were running.
 Kind of like orphans that want to grab food and eat way too much.
 But they couldn't grab so much, they just took a little and they ran.
 And another one took a little and it ran.
 And then this beautiful impression, where he took the first one.
 You're not a rat, you're an amazing son.
 He took the first son and he just said, you're my favorite.
 And it was so beautiful and then he said, come here.
 And he took him and he said, come here.
 And he was able to go straight through the table too.
 And he said, sit right next to me. Just wait here for a second.
 And then he walked through again.
 He just walked right through again.
 And he walked right through.
 And he found a daughter.
 Come here sweetie. He found another one.
 And he just walked right through.
 And he looked her right in the eyes.
 And he said, you're my favorite.
 You're my favorite.
 Wait a minute.
 I thought he said he was his favorite.
 But wait a minute. How can she be his favorite and he be his favorite?
 And I realized he is who he says he is.
 He's a good, good father.
 And you can be his favorite.
 And I can be his favorite.
 And you can be his favorite.
 Shaka Bala. We don't have to fight.
 We don't have to fight.
 We can love one another.
 Because we're secure.
 We're secure in the love the father has for us.
 It's so beautiful. And we're so free.
 Thank you father. We're free.
 Bless you guys. Thanks for being here.
 His favorite.
 When you understand this, competition goes.
 I may be controversial but it's okay.
 I believe God loves his Ishmael sons and his Isaac sons.
 I believe that he loves all his sons and daughters.
 So much.
 And all he wants is that we would stop killing each other.
 We would stop killing each other.
 Because he's a loving father and he wants every single one of his children home.
 And love.
 And love.
 It has to look like reconciliation.
 It has to look like reconciliation.
 But what do you mean? Who does he love?
 He loves that tribe and hates that tribe.
 Jesus died for the whole world.
 He didn't just die for one tribe.
 One tongue, one son, one daughter.
 He died for the whole world.
 He died for the whole world.
 Shaka Raba, he died for the whole world.
 And we need to be his hands.
 His hands. His feet. His heart.
 We need to see with the eyes of love.
 And that does bring reconciliation.
 I love the body of Christ.
 They are very interesting.
 I mean, interesting, do you?
 They are a wild bunch.
 Really, really, you could go to one church.
 I'm just having fun like your wife, you know.
 She came up here, didn't she?
 Yeah, you can come on up.
 I just looked at Pastor Linda.
 And I looked at her.
 Now look at them.
 You're going to face them.
 Look at them. They're just beautiful.
 They're just so beautiful.
 She's doing what she does so perfectly beautifully well.
 And she does what she does so perfectly beautifully.
 And you might notice they don't have the same style.
 And they're just so, so beautiful.
 And they're both his favorite.
 It's just so beautiful. I just look at you.
 It's just awesome.
 I'm like, thank you Jesus.
 You're so full of Jesus.
 And you're just shining.
 Like, look at you.
 No, you don't have one?
 No.
 Ah!
 Is it okay?
 That we get to be different in the body of Christ.
 And we can love each other.
 And we can shine.
 Holy is the name. Thank you.
 The body of Christ is so beautiful.
 But you have to have the eyes to see.
 And when you have the eyes to see.
 And you understand how father feels.
 About all of his children.
 The ones that even are pre-believers.
 So the pre-believers don't even know they're his yet.
 But he knows he's there.
 Oh yeah, he knows he's there.
 And he loves them so much.
 I'm going to read scripture before I get in trouble.
 Meeting number 29.
 I'm going to read some more scripture.
 And now dear children, continue in him.
 So that we, when we appear, or when he appears.
 We may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming.
 Verse 28 in 1 John 2.
 Dear children, continue in him.
 So that we may be confident when he appears.
 And we may not be ashamed before him at his coming.
 If you know that he is righteous.
 Then you realize that everyone who does what is right is born of him.
 How, how, how, how, how, how, how, how great is the love of God.
 How great is the love the Father has lavished on us.
 That we should be called children.
 Beloved children.
 All of us, beloved children.
 All of us, beloved.
 Everyone beloved.
 How great is his love.
 That he didn't choose one and reject the other.
 Where we find out from the cross.
 When the cross, the beautiful cross.
 When Jesus gave himself on that cross.
 He ripped the dividing line.
 He ripped the veil.
 He says, he says, all the oxen free.
 You can say it just like that.
 All the oxen free.
 He says, everybody is free.
 I was in a wild meeting.
 A young people, young, I mean I still get asked to do the youth conferences.
 I was in one in Israel.
 And it was full of Arabs and Jews together.
 They were Aki Padush.
 I think in Portuguese a lot.
 I don't think in English a lot.
 They were like all, like a lot of them had
 machine guns.
 They had weapons.
 There were some Arabs there.
 There was Israeli military there.
 I just decided, I'm a mama right.
 I just want to hug them all.
 And we decided we're going to have a fire tunnel.
 You saw Arabs and Jews and military guys with machine guns going through this fire.
 They were knocked out all over the place.
 I'm thinking if anyone looks at us.
 They're going to think we're really, really, you know, we're in trouble here.
 To have all these bodies laid out all over the place.
 And I'm thinking God, God just loves his children.
 Pontus final, that's it.
 He loves them all.
 And that bothers some people.
 It bothers some people.
 How can he?
 I'm going to tell you a story that's going to be challenging for you.
 But it's going to provoke you.
 I feel like bringing this back a tiny bit because I want to see you guys over there and you guys over there.
 I want to see you so, this helps me.
 So the love of God, it's just so glorious.
 And he wants us to have that kind of love.
 The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him.
 Dear friends, now we are children of God.
 And what we will be is yet not been made known.
 But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him.
 For we shall see him as he is.
 Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself just as he is pure.
 One of chapter three, down to verse three.
 See what love the Father has given us.
 We are called children of God.
 And we are.
 The world does not know us because it has not learned to know him.
 My beloved, now we are children of God.
 And it is not yet revealed what we will be.
 But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him.
 For we shall see him as he is.
 And everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself just as he is pure.
 Hallelujah, when we behold him, we become like him.
 When you behold him, Christ in you the hope of glory.
 Christ in you the hope of glory.
 Christ in me the hope of glory.
 I want to be that love ball.
 I want to be able to love people in a radical way.
 But I can only do that when he loves me.
 Yeah, when I receive his love, then I can pour out love.
 When I behold his face, then I can shine.
 Because I spend time in the presence of God.
 Face to face, heart to heart.
 We don't need to be dry.
 We don't need to be dry.
 So I'm going to tell you some weak things.
 I love to share, well I didn't necessarily love to share these things, but the Lord showed me to share these things.
 That it is in my weakness and sharing my weakness that I can share strength.
 That it is in my weakness and sharing my weakness that I can share strength.
 It's like being soft and having a broken foot when you pray for the sick.
 They get healed, but you hold them around, but they get to pray for me and I get healed.
 Anyway, it's okay.
 We just soften ourselves before the Lord.
 And he will lift you up.
 So I carry a pillow.
 Do you see this? It's not a prop.
 It's not a prop. It's not a...
 I actually need it.
 Because I like to go face down.
 And the Lord knocked me down years ago.
 Seven days, seven nights.
 I did not have a pillow.
 And I'm telling you, my prayer was not just,
 Oh, more Lord. My prayer was,
 Please talk to someone to give me a pillow.
 Because my head hurts on this hard floor.
 When I was lying there, my child was not only, Oh Lord, but also,
 Lord, tell someone to give me a pillow, because my head hurts on this hard floor.
 And about day three, somebody gave me a pillow and I sobbed like a baby, because I couldn't speak.
 And on day three, I got a pillow and I cried like a child.
 Anyway, that's a long story.
 So I was at a big event. It was a stadium event.
 And I think I was the very last speaker.
 But everybody else needed time, you know, so the time was going on.
 But I had my pillow.
 It was about a 12-hour meeting.
 Not 29 of them, but a 12-hour meeting.
 And we were just worshipping. It was beautiful worship.
 Beautiful worship. It was glorious.
 And I'm down there and I'm just having a great time with the Lord.
 Just face down, behind the veil, behind the curtain.
 I didn't want to chit chat, talk to anybody, no green room for me.
 I just wanted to be in the presence.
 I love His presence.
 And it was about 11 or so.
 I knew I was going to speak soon.
 And some little woman, a teenager, I believe.
 She got up.
 And she said,
 We need to look, now I'm face down.
 I don't see her, but later I caught a glimpse of her.
 And I mean, you know when you really feel anointing and sometimes you just don't?
 I didn't particularly feel like, whoa, the whole atmosphere shifted when she walked in.
 Just being real.
 She just said,
 We all need to love one another.
 And we need to forgive one another.
 And where you have love, you have authority.
 Well, I've said that for years.
 And I just thought, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 That's right.
 I forgave my mother.
 I forgave my mother.
 I forgave my husband.
 I've been married 45 years, so sometimes you're going to forgive one another.
 Hallelujah.
 That's real.
 That's real.
 That's real.
 Love wins.
 Covenant wins.
 So she said, you should love everyone.
 Forgive everyone.
 And I'm thinking, yeah, yeah, yeah.
 And then the Lord tapped me.
 Do you know when he taps you?
 And he's like, I'm facedown.
 I'm fasting.
 I'm facedown.
 I'm not in some green room.
 I'm being funny here, but you know, I'm not chit chatting.
 I'm in the glory all day long.
 So why should I be just like, why is he tapping me like that?
 So why, why is he tapping me like that?
 Well, I had to leave my country for six weeks.
 But I didn't know how long it would be.
 Why did I have to do it?
 Because one of our pastors, senior leaders, was selling me to El Shabab.
 Selling me.
 Selling me for ransom to El Shabab ISIS.
 So I was not, you know, feeling the love for those people.
 I mean, I thought I had enough love.
 I thought I loved people.
 I really thought I did.
 But these people that had killed, beheaded, tortured, are people that we love.
 They beheaded them.
 But these people that have tortured, beheaded, burned our churches.
 This is my province, where I live.
 Where I still live.
 And I had to leave because of this price on my head.
 So I'm being really honest with you.
 I did not feel the love for them.
 I did not feel love.
 I did not feel love.
 But I thought I had love, but I didn't have it.
 And he said, oh, he tapped me on the shoulder.
 He said, do you love El Shabab?
 I started, I gave him a list.
 I started telling God my list.
 I said, they killed our pastors, four year old.
 I said, they burned this church.
 They burned that one.
 They slaughtered people.
 I kept telling God my list.
 I had to leave the country because of these people.
 And God did not give a rip about my list.
 I don't know how you're going to say it, but he did not want to hear it.
 He didn't like my list.
 He just asked me the question again.
 Do you love El Shabab?
 I took my pillow, I'm face down.
 And I said, no! No! No!
 I had to be honest because if you're not honest, God knows you're not.
 You think you can fool people sometimes.
 But you can't fool God.
 He knows your heart.
 He knows your innermost workings.
 He knows whether you have love for a people he asks, do you have love for them?
 He knows if you love people he asks you to love.
 And he wants to rip up your list.
 Rip it right there.
 He asked me, would you like me to give you love for them?
 He asked me, would you like me to give you love for them?
 I wasn't beating my pillow on the floor by then, but I was like...
 I didn't hit the pillow on the ground, but I was like...
 Really? They're really, really, really, really bad.
 I'm thinking they're really, really, really, really bad.
 They're so bad.
 They're so evil.
 They're so mean.
 They're so evil.
 And then I gave up.
 I said, yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Alright, yes.
 And the power of God hit me.
 And he showed me these little boys.
 Like the children that we had picked up for years from the garbage dump in the streets.
 He showed me them in their shredded red.
 He showed me these boys.
 And he said, they're just broken little boys.
 Won't you love them too?
 They're just broken little boys.
 And he ripped the note out of me.
 And he loved them too.
 And he ripped this note out of me.
 Do you want to know the fruit?
 The next day.
 Here I was. I literally had to flee the country during a blood red moon.
 I had 14 people on my intercession group without knowing.
 John and Carol Arnett started...
 They said, you've got to leave now.
 They could speak into my life, but they've never done something like that.
 They said, now, now, now.
 Remember that?
 Then I heard all these words.
 Rebecca was living there.
 And I heard all these words, but I said, I'm going to leave.
 And I said, I'm going to leave.
 And I heard all these words, but I said, I'm not going to just listen to a person.
 God, you have to speak to me.
 You're going to have to speak to me.
 And I'm telling you, I mean, I've studied a long, long time, but I'm telling you, all that study just went out the window that moment.
 I just took my Bible Pentecostal style.
 I just opened it up.
 Speak to me.
 Oh yeah.
 It said, pack your bags in the daytime.
 Don't look back.
 It was like, okay.
 So I called Rebecca.
 I said, I'm going to go to sleep.
 Because it's nighttime.
 But tomorrow, in the middle of the day, we're going to get on a plane.
 I had to give away several suitcases so people wouldn't know I was going to the airport.
 And she's my witness.
 I put my head down.
 I mean, been serving in this nation.
 By that time, for over two and a half decades, I'd put my head down.
 Because when the Lord speaks to me, I will obey.
 And I put my head down, and I didn't look back.
 And I did not even know how long that would be.
 After that stadium event,
 where I screamed no, and God switched, changed, molded my heart.
 The very next day, the very next day, the pastors called me.
 Because obviously we talk, we pray, we communicate.
 And they said, mama, we're really, really hurting.
 We've been beaten very badly.
 They said Felipe, his arm's broken.
 And they said another pastor, Augusto's eye was hanging down.
 And they went through the list.
 They said we were beaten so badly.
 And they're crying on the phone.
 And I'm crying in their cry.
 I said, how'd you escape?
 I mean, Al Shabab doesn't usually let people go.
 They were going to an all-night prayer meeting at our farm in Meazi.
 About 20 some minutes from where I lived.
 And they accidentally turned towards the prison.
 And what happened was the military police thought that our pastors were Al Shabab.
 And because they thought they were Al Shabab, they beat them mercilessly.
 And they said, tonight you die and put machine gun on their heads.
 And our pastors started screaming.
 We're at the church! We're Communion at the church! We're the church! You know us! We're the church!
 We're not Al Shabab, we're the church!
 Finally one of them said, oh, they are the church.
 They're the ones that feed us. They're the ones that give us the solar by the way.
 They give us food and stop beating them.
 Let them go.
 About half of them went to the hospital.
 The other half home.
 This is the day after.
 Hey, I want to speak to you about friendly fire.
 I want to speak to you about shooting at your allies.
 What's it called in Swedish?
 Friendly fire.
 And I want to put it in terms of the body of Christ.
 When we hurt our brother, our sister.
 Because we don't agree with them, so we hurt them or we ridicule them or we attack them.
 We don't agree with them, so we hurt them, we say evil things about them, we hurt them, we destroy them.
 It's called friendly fire.
 Because we're supposed to be on the same side.
 But it's not friendly.
 The love of God has to look like something.
 The love of God has to look like something.
 And feel like something.
 And for my brothers.
 They have protected me many, many, many times.
 Because they've forgotten.
 I know it's because they've forgotten.
 It's because literally the night before.
 The Lord shifted my heart and gave me love for El Shabab.
 And then my brothers had to go through.
 You can argue theology, but let's not.
 My brothers went through what they went through.
 They were beaten.
 And they were hurt.
 And they were painfully, painfully aware.
 That they needed more love.
 What happened?
 The next morning.
 The next morning.
 When my brothers were talking to me.
 The very next morning.
 They said.
 The military police came to our base.
 Our joy base.
 With a letter.
 I have it.
 It's my treasure.
 It's a treasure.
 It's a huge treasure to me.
 And on the letter they asked in writing for an apology.
 For beating these brothers.
 And they said we would like to offer you full, full access to the prison again.
 And they said we would like to offer you full access to the prison again.
 And we got full access to the prison again.
 Seven names were signed on the document.
 And my name is on the document.
 So you have to come in.
 Full access to the prison.
 Guess who's in the prison?
 El Shabab.
 Full access. Full access. Full access.
 So we take in. These brothers go in.
 It's full of El Shabab.
 I mean, and they go in there.
 Oh, if you have that audio Bible.
 I'm not going to put it on.
 It's in there. It's in there.
 Oh, it's not?
 It is. Oh, yeah.
 So anyway, they go in.
 Full access.
 And when the war started, they closed the prison doors to us.
 Because a man from another faith became the director.
 But because of what happened,
 because our brothers said, of course we forgave you.
 They felt bad for beating them so bad.
 They said we could go in.
 So we have these. These are amazing tools.
 These are audio solar Bibles.
 We have them in Makua, Makonde, Yaomani, Portuguese.
 And he just put it on.
 You just put it on.
 Charge it in the sun.
 And you get to hear the word of God.
 All day long. All day long.
 Yay! All day long.
 Oh, oh, this story, this story gets even better.
 You're not going to forget this.
 It gets even better.
 It gets even better.
 Guess who created these?
 The first people created them.
 They're Israelis.
 But then, wait, wait, wait, wait.
 They weren't Messianic.
 They created the technology.
 Wild, anyway.
 Okay, God's gone.
 He can do anything, through anyone.
 But it gets really, really, really better.
 So my husband, he's fourth generation missionary.
 I'm the first born again person in my family.
 I left them all to Jesus. Hallelujah.
 But my husband, he has an amazing, you know, an amazing legacy of missions.
 And his father.
 Father.
 Was the only survivor.
 Of the children who were born in China.
 Because they died.
 And H.A. Baker who wrote Visions Beyond the Veil.
 His grandfather.
 Who ministered to him.
 Since the time he was able to understand.
 And told him about children.
 That saw visions of heaven.
 That saw visions of hell.
 And they were given food to eat.
 And they saw King Jesus.
 He told them all about it.
 And Roland just knew that one day he would do that same work.
 That's how we started in Mozambique.
 Listen, listen, it gets better. It gets better.
 It gets better. I just want to jump around. I'm not going to jump.
 This is bothering me, but I'll jump soon.
 So listen.
 I just said listen, because it's too good.
 Because you're sleeping after 29 minutes.
 Wake up. Wake up.
 Listen, this is amazing.
 Roland's father.
 While Roland and his mom and dad, they had to escape China.
 He was quite a bit older.
 Before the Cultural Revolution, when it started, Roland had to escape China.
 Roland and his parents had to flee the country.
 With his mom and dad.
 Because the communists were coming in.
 This is real. This is the Gospel.
 And Roland was in a boat and they were shooting.
 And they escaped to Hong Kong.
 They escaped to Hong Kong.
 And Roland's father and mother started a Bible school.
 We just experienced this.
 They started this Bible school in Hong Kong.
 Knowing that every one of their students would go back to China.
 And they would, all of them, all of them would be martyred.
 Three full classrooms.
 Three full graduating classes.
 They all knew.
 They were going to be martyred.
 They all went back to China.
 Out of those children that were in the visions.
 Of heaven. And angels and Jesus.
 Two survived.
 The rest were martyred.
 Long story short.
 Roland's grandfather after having no fruit.
 When he was filled with the Holy Spirit and he went back to China.
 Over 10,000 believers were baptized.
 In the Yunnan province.
 And the Lisu tribe.
 The Lisu tribe.
 A minister, missionary called Morrison and Roland made a script for them.
 And they made characters for them that they could read.
 They translated the Bible with characters so they could get the Bible.
 One of the greatest outpourings right now in China is among the Lisu tribe.
 And now that they have got these letters translated.
 Right now, almost the most Chinese in the Lisu tribe.
 It gets better though.
 It gets better.
 It gets better.
 So we want to take the word of God in right?
 To these unreached people groups.
 How are they going to know the love of God?
 Unless they know the word of God.
 And most of them don't read and write.
 So then.
 The underground church in China.
 They took the solar bible.
 They reworked it.
 They made it really loud.
 And then they sent us 40 foot containers full of them.
 Woo!
 And all the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people now.
 In northern Mozambique.
 Including El Shabab.
 I've given their hearts to Jesus.
 Because of the underground church in China.
 And then the legacy.
 Of my husband's family.
 And I only found out that the Lisu were the most touched at this moment in history.
 A couple of days ago.
 While I was fellowshiping with one of my hero's brother Yun.
 And his wife.
 Oh God.
 Oh God.
 Oh God.
 All of you.
 Could put that kind of love in people's hearts.
 He is the king of glory.
 He could do anything.
 With any little life laid down.
 Would you just like to offer yourself completely?
 Without a list.
 Without telling the Lord why you don't have to do whatever you think you...
 Whatever you don't have to do.
 Just rip up your list.
 I went home.
 All these guys. These broken little boys.
 All these broken, broken boys.
 They've been coming. Not just coming to Jesus.
 It's not just that they are coming to Jesus now.
 They've been weeping and sobbing.
 And snuffing.
 They've been crying their lives out.
 Because God.
 That our God does what he does.
 And that Jesus would forgive them.
 When they saw their guts out.
 They couldn't really be true.
 It couldn't really be true that God.
 Could seriously forgive us.
 If he really sent Jesus.
 For people like us.
 Love wins.
 Love wins.
 Love wins.
 Love wins. Love wins.
 If we surrender our lives to love.
 If we give up our lives to love.
 The Lord will bring.
 Reconciliation.
 He will bring it.
 This world will know.
 That we are Christians by our love.
 That's how they're going to know.
 It's by our love.
 Hallelujah.
 I'm going to read one last scripture.
 It's worth saying hallelujah.
 Hallelujah.
 Worthy is the love of God.
 Who takes away the sins of the world.
 I don't deserve that kind of love.
 But he gave it to me.
 I am most grateful.
 I am the most grateful person.
 That he would stop for me.
 That he would offer me himself.
 That he would offer me himself.
 I don't understand how he could even humble himself so deeply to use me.
 Or us.
 Only Jesus.
 He's so merciful.
 He said I'll send Holy Spirit.
 He will send Holy Spirit.
 We're called to remain.
 This is the message you heard from the beginning.
 Verse 11.
 That we should love one another.
 Don't be like Cain who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother.
 Why did he murder him?
 His own actions were evil.
 And his brothers were righteous.
 Do not be surprised my brothers if the world hates you.
 We know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers.
 We know that we have gone from death to life because we love our brothers.
 Anyone who does not love remains in death.
 Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer.
 And you know that no murderer has eternal life in him.
 The one who doesn't love is left in death.
 The one who hates his brother is a murderer.
 And you know that no murderer has eternal life in him.
 This is how we know what love is.
 Jesus Christ laid down his life for us.
 So now we ought to, we get to lay down our lives for our brothers.
 By giving his life for us we have learned to feel love.
 So we are guilty.
 We are given our lives for our brothers.
 If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him.
 How can the love of God be in him?
 Dear children, let us not love with words.
 Words, words, words are cheap.
 Let us love with action.
 And in truth.
 Action.
 And in truth.
 We love one another.
 We lay our lives down.
 We love with action.
 And then we rest.
 Oh yeah.
 Then we rest.
 Then this is how we know we belong to the truth.
 And how we set our hearts at rest in his presence.
 Whenever our hearts condemn us for God is greater than our hearts and he knows everything.
 Then we know that we belong to the truth.
 And in his presence and in front of him we can convince our hearts.
 If it condemns us that God is greater than our hearts and knows everything.
 That pastor that fell far from the plot.
 That had it in his heart to sell me.
 For a lot of money.
 The first time they were selling was 20 dollars.
 This was a big, big lot more money this time.
 But a man came, a missionary.
 A Mexican missionary came.
 And I asked him if he would go to this man's house.
 Because he was dying, he was about to die.
 And he went to his home.
 And that man confessed all of his sins.
 And all of the plots.
 And when I get to heaven.
 All of the plans he had when I get to heaven.
 Then he will be one of the very first ones.
 That I will meet.
 I will meet him there.
 Because in a moment.
 Jesus will be there.
 Come on.
 My God's love.
 If we could stand please.
 And I will share one more story of incredible love.
 God is greater than our hearts and he knows everything.
 That sounds, that looks good.
 That looks good.
 It's not because I'm religious.
 I know that when God's presence comes things change.
 I want to invite the worship team.
 We're not going to do background.
 We're going to go into the presence.
 Dear friends.
 If our hearts do not condemn us.
 We have confidence before God.
 And we receive from him anything we ask.
 We love.
 Because he first loved us.
 We lay our lives down.
 In action and in truth.
 We rest in his presence.
 And then we can ask.
 When he put love in my heart.
 For El Shabab.
 I asked for El Shabab.
 I asked for those broken little boys.
 I asked for them that they would know the love of God.
 And my brothers.
 Including the ones who have lost their own family members.
 They go in.
 And they share radical love.
 And my brothers and sisters.
 One of the men who was most tortured for his faith.
 He is the most joyful loving man.
 Along with Supriza.
 That I have ever met.
 And he said we will get the word of God.
 To northern Mozambique.
 And that is where a revival.
 A massive revival.
 A people group.
 Not the kind of thing that you maybe think of revival as.
 But a people group coming to the Lord.
 And then another one.
 And another one.
 Oh.
 Could we yield our little lives to God.
 Could we rip up the list.
 Could we just tear it up.
 And say yes to anything that he asks of us.
 This is my command to believe in the name of his son Jesus Christ.
 This is his command.
 And to love one another as he has commanded.
 Those who obey his command live in him.
 And he in them.
 And this is how we know that he lives in us.
 We know it by the spirits that he gave us.
 That he gave us.
 I feel like this call is.
 I don't know.
 I used to do altar calls so much differently.
 But I feel like this is just for a few minutes.
 You've had 29 meetings.
 So just come.
 All of us come.
 And we'll just all come forward.
 And if we could just get low.
 If you can't get low.
 You could just sit on the stairs.
 But there's something that happens when we make a move.
 I feel like God is calling us to this radical love.
 And he's calling us to radical forgiveness.
 Where we literally rip up our list.
 Our excuses.
 For not loving.
 And we just rip them up.
 And as you are just yielding yourself to God.
 I feel to tell you this little girl.
 I found a little girl.
 I found this little one on the street.
 It was years ago.
 She had one leg.
 Her other leg was burned off.
 She became a 10 year old prostitute.
 Because her grandmother said she was no use.
 With no leg.
 Her brothers stoned her.
 And thought she was dead.
 But she lived.
 And a man found her.
 Bloody in a field.
 With one leg left.
 He took her to the hospital.
 And she recovered there.
 But when she was let out she had nowhere to go.
 So she had to sell herself to survive.
 Pennies.
 All she got were pennies.
 Few medicare.
 And I found her one day.
 I brought her home.
 She was full of darkness.
 She was hurting.
 She became beautifully powerfully.
 Radically born again.
 The Lord healed her heart.
 Healed her so much.
 And one day she came to me.
 Come Holy Spirit.
 Come Holy Spirit.
 And she said mama.
 I'm going home. I have to go home.
 I said no you're not.
 That is the most dysfunctional family I've ever heard of.
 You're not going back there.
 She literally rebuked me.
 She looked at me with her eyes just burning eyes.
 You said we were supposed to love everyone.
 And you said Jesus forgives.
 How could I not go home to my family?
 How could I not love them?
 So some pastors went with her.
 And she went and forgave.
 Her grandmother cursed her.
 One brother mocked her.
 The other brother was powerfully born again.
 Somebody made her a little leg.
 From UK they made her a little leg.
 And I had the great privilege of marrying her.
 To her bride groom.
 And in the front row were both brothers.
 And that day that second brother came to Christ.
 Love wins.
 She was a shining beautiful bride.
 She taught me about radical love.
 And radical forgiveness.
 I believe right now the Lord is asking you.
 Just to put your hand on your heart.
 And ask him.
 Just ask God oh God.
 I want love Lord.
 You can ask for love you can.
 He is the author of love.
 He is the author of it.
 Right now can you take your list of excuses.
 Of why you can't go somewhere.
 Maybe he is sending you to an unreached people group.
 Maybe he is sending you back to your own family.
 Maybe he is sending you to go and love someone who has been really really really cruel.
 What do you do?
 Ask God right now let's ask him.
 For more love.
 And let's allow the Lord to baptize us right now.
 Right now.
 Let's lift our hands.
 And let's behold him.
 I want you to behold him.
 Behold the father.
 He looks to you.
 He takes you by the shoulders.
 He takes you by the shoulders.
 He looks you in the eye.
 Knowing everything about you.
 There is nothing hidden.
 There is nothing hidden.
 But it's by great grace.
 It's only by great grace.
 It's only by great grace.
 That we can be saved.
 It's only by great grace.
 That we can receive love.
 It's only by great grace.
 That we can give love.
 So I'm going to pray the Lord bless you.
 And the Lord keep you.
 And the Lord make his glorious grace.
 Shine upon you.
 And give you peace.
 And give you joy.
 Joy unspeakable and full of glory.
 And give you joy unspeakable and full of glory.
 And this is...
 Pastor Linda gave me great freedom here.
 So this is what I'm sensing.
 About half of you, maybe more.
 You need to go home right now.
 You need to go home now.
 And go home and just process with the Lord.
 Some of you need to call your...
 Some people, you need to make some phone calls.
 Some of you need to speak to your spouse.
 Some of you need to call your children.
 Some of you need to call your mother.
 Your step father.
 Your auntie.
 Your boss.
 Maybe wait till Monday for the boss.
 I feel like the Lord wants to allow people this freedom to go home now.
 There's been so many things that have happened in these 29 meetings.
 And sleep, he says, I want to set your heart at rest in my presence.
 And sleep is really, really a gift from the Lord.
 So we bless you that are leaving now in the beautiful name of the Father.
 Son Jesus, the Holy Spirit.
 You're not less spiritual, if you're going home.
 It's your assignment to go home.
 It's your assignment to go home.
 And then in 10 minutes, those who have another assignment, just to worship.
 Not to...
 By just a little bit after 10, we're all going to leave.
 Because there's something the Lord wants to do, even with rest.
 Sets our heart at rest.
 I'm going to beg, I only beg for this one thing.
 That you would not look to me now.
 That every eye and every heart would be focused on the beauty of Jesus.
 That every heart and eye would be focused on the beauty of Jesus.
 The beatific vision, the beauty of Jesus.
 We're not going to sing about him.
 We're just going to sing to him.
 We're just going to give these next 10 minutes or so, just a wholehearted adoration.
 And Holy Spirit is going to fall.
 It's going to fall on people who are in their homes.
 It's going to fall on people as we're worshiping.
 Someone may lay hands on you.
 Maybe they will, maybe they won't.
 But that's not what we're focusing on.
 We're worshiping.
 Oh, let's go up.
 Let's go in.
 I am empty-handed, I'm empty-handed.
 Majesty, Majesty
 Your hammer I have changed by your love
 In the presence of your Majesty
 Majesty, Majesty
 Your grace has found me just as I am
 Empty-handed but alive in your hands
 Majesty, Majesty
 Forever I am changed by your love
 In the presence of your Majesty
 You are worthy of it all
 You are worthy of it all
 For for you are all things
 And you, you are all things
 You deserve the glory
 You are worthy of it all
 You are worthy of it all
 For from you are all things
 And to you are all things
 You deserve the glory
 You are worthy of it all
 Jesus, you are worthy of it all
 For from you are all things
 And to you are all things
 You deserve the glory
 Day and night

 Hej! Välkommen till förskolan Växthuset. Jag heter Lasse Petersson och jag är rektor här.
 Vi är en mindre förskola som lägger vikt vid trygghet än förutsättning för lärande.
 Växthuset är en fristående förskola med kristen profil.
 Vi finns i Kungsängen i Upplandsbro.
 Vi vistas mycket i vår fantastiska utemiljö som inbjuder till lek- och grovmotorisk utveckling.
 Vi använder oss även av vårt närområde med skogen och det vackra lillsjön.
 Vi jobbar mycket med värdigunnsfrågor och det sociala samspelet.
 Vår kristen profil erbjuder barnen möjlighet att höra och uppleva Bibels budskap,
 bland annat genom bibelberättelser, skapande och sånger.
 Genom våra lärmiljöer vill vi skapa mötesplatser mellan barn,
 som barn och pedagoger, där vi kan leka, upptäcka och utforska tillsammans.
 Vi jobbar projektinriktat efter läroplansmålen som främjar det livslånga lärandet.
 Växthuset är en plats där ditt barn kan vara sedd, trygg och växa.
 Varmt välkommen med din ansöka. Du kan också komma och besöka oss.
 Vi har en liten besökskapskommission om vad Jesus har gjort för att du ska kunna komma loss ifrån det.
 Mitt namn är Stelsbar-Gorsharsen, och i kursen för sången så går vi igenom just detta.
 Ansök till Bibelskolan redan idag och få något spännande att se fram emot till hösten.
 Vi ses på Bibelskolan!
