 Welcome to the Arken meeting, the last meeting at the Miraka Festival.
 Now we have reached the very last meeting, I have understood that it is the 29th meeting that we have had.
 It has been fantastic, God has been so so so good towards us through his grace.
 We are going to sing about this, how God is so good.
 And maybe you have come here for your first meeting, maybe you have been at the 29th meeting.
 Anyway, it is Sunday and you can feel a little, either very quick or tired.
 But then there is something that says that we offer the sacrifice of the law, a fruit from lips that praises his name.
 And I think that when you praise God, he will meet you with his spirit, his embellishment, which breaks every evil and gives strength and strength.
 And we look forward to that hey, you will get the same today.
 So, shall we start in a wonderful way here?
 Somebody testify.
 God is good all the time.
 Put a song of praise in his heart of mine.
 God is good all the time.
 In the darkness nights, his light will shine.
 God is good, God is good all the time.
 If you're walking, if you're walking through the valley, keep his shadows all around.
 Do not fear, he will guide you, he will keep you safe inside.
 He has promised you, he can't believe you, he won't forsake you.
 God is good all the time.
 Put a song of praise in his heart of mine.
 God is good all the time.
 In the darkness nights, his light will shine.
 God is good, God is good all the time.
 Oh, we were sinners, we were sinners.
 No one worthy, still for us he chose to die.
 Fill us with Holy Spirit, now we can stand and testify.
 That his love, that his love is everlasting.
 And his mercies they will never end.
 God is good all the time.
 Put a song of praise in his heart of mine.
 God is good all the time.
 In the darkness nights, his light will shine.
 God is good, God is good all the time.
 Though I may not understand, though I may not understand
 all the plans you have for me.
 My life is in your hands, and through the eyes of faith
 I can clearly see that God is good all the time.
 Put a song of praise in his heart of mine.
 God is good all the time.
 Through the darkness nights, his light will shine.
 God is good, God is good all the time.
 Hallelujah, God is good.
 God is good all the time.
 Put a song of praise in his heart of mine.
 God is good all the time.
 Through the darkness nights, his light will shine.
 God is good, God is good all the time.
 God is good, God is good all the time.
 Put a song of praise in his heart of mine.
 God is good all the time.
 Through the darkness nights, his light will shine.
 God is good, God is good all the time.
 God is good, God is good all the time.
 Put a song of praise in his heart of mine.
 God is good all the time.
 Through the darkness nights, his light will shine.
 God is good, God is good, God is good, God is good.
 He's so good.
 God is good, praise is good all the time.
 God is good all the time.
 God is good.
 Amen.
 Jesus, we are all for you.
 All our lives.
 We deserve you.
 Jesus, until Jesus

 I leave you and lie in your name.

 Lord, you call us with a holy calling
 to follow you, to serve you, to love you.
 Lord, we want to be allowed into you.
 When we raise our hands, when we praise you, Jesus
 we say that you are welcome, Jesus.
 You are welcome, holy spirit, to do what you want in our lives.
 We love you.
 You give us strength.

 Let the poor say I am brave in the Lord.
 Let the poor say I am strong in the Lord.
 We trust in you, God.

 I will wade, may my sins are washed away, from the heavens' mercy sweet,
 O'er the Savior's love for me.
 Hosanna, Hosanna to the Lamb that was slain.
 Hosanna, Hosanna, Jesus died and was slain.
 Hosanna, Hosanna, to the Lamb that was slain.
 Hosanna, Hosanna, Jesus died and was slain.
 And I will rise from borders deep, through the saving arms of God.
 I will sing salvation songs, Jesus Christ has set me free.
 And I will rise, I will rise from borders deep, into the saving arms of God.
 I will sing salvation songs, Jesus Christ has set me free.

 Hosanna, Hosanna, to the Lamb that was slain.
 Hosanna, Hosanna, Jesus died and was slain.
 Jesus died and was slain.
 Jesus died and was slain.
 So let the weak say, I am strong.
 Let the poor say, I am rich.
 Let the blind say, I can see.
 It's what the Lord has done in me.
 You are the love of my life.
 You are the hope that I cling to.
 You mean the world to me.
 You are the love of my life.
 You mean more than this world to me.
 I wouldn't trade you for silver or gold.
 No, I wouldn't trade you for riches untold.
 You are, you are my everything.
 I couldn't take one step without you.
 I can never go on.
 I couldn't live one day without you.
 I don't have the strength to make it on my own.
 But you are.
 You are the love of my life.
 You are the hope that I cling to.
 You mean more than this world to me.
 I wouldn't trade you for silver or gold.
 I wouldn't trade you for riches untold.
 But for anything you are, you are my everything.
 Until the world stops turning.
 Until the world stops turning.
 Until the stars fade from the sky.
 Until the sun stops rising.
 I need you in my life.
 And here's the reason why.
 You are, you are the love of my life.
 Yes, you are.
 You are the hope that I cling to.
 You mean more than this world to me.
 I wouldn't trade you for silver or gold.
 Not for anything.
 I wouldn't trade you for riches untold.
 You are, you are.
 You are my everything.
 You are my everything.
 Oh, du er alt for os. Du er alt for os.
 I wouldn't trade you for silver or gold.
 No, I wouldn't trade you for riches untold.
 You are, you are my everything.
 Yes, you are.
 You are, you are my everything.
 Your heart.
 You are singing tongues and you are praising.
 Oh, you love him.
 Because he is here.
 He is here.
 He is here.
 Just love him.
 No silver or gold can even be compared to his presence.
 So come the beautiful breath of Christmas.
 Sin makes Jesus, holy breath.
 Sin makes Jesus.
 You are, you are.
 You are, you are.
 Oh, yes, my dear.
 Jesus.
 Jesus.
 Jesus.
 Oh, we love you.
 Oh, we love you, Jesus.
 Oh, we love you.
 We love you.
 Oh, we love you.
 Oh, what we love you, Jesus.
 Transform our faces when we pray.
 We can shine with your love, with your goodness.
 Transform our faces and our clothes when we stand before your face.
 So you can shine through us, Jesus.
 And we lift this afternoon evening for you.
 It is so important to you, Jesus.
 It is so precious to you because you have called the brothers and sisters here
 to get a meeting place with them.
 And I ask them to hear your voice,
 feel your Christmas touch.
 Be changed, be changed.
 So that what is inside them, they will shine through them.
 It should be transparent and beautiful.
 So it can shine through.
 Thank you, Jesus.
 Thank you, Jesus.
 Thank you, Jesus.
 Thank you for a moment.
 Wonderful.
 You are the love of my life.
 You can't compare it to anything else.
 So, my dear friends, now it is the last meeting
 for this miracle conference.
 And we long for more.
 Don't we?
 So we are going to go out on this meeting.
 We are not going to get tired of it,
 but this is the last meeting for this time with Heidi Baker.
 So we just give her a love applause.
 Wonderful to see you here.
 We have been at many meetings.
 Now it is the 29th meeting.
 And people have been replaced too.
 The Finns have gone home, big groups have gone home.
 So you could be here for a few days.
 So we are going to have a look at different
 smudges and see different parts of the body of Christ.
 I think that these days with Heidi Baker
 there is a lot of love smudges.
 Some people can come up on a higher path
 together with Jesus.
 I felt that yesterday God moved so much
 in many of our lives.
 And you felt that I wanted to come in contact with love.
 I had a word that I will just quote.
 It was when Jesus took his disciples
 on the mountain of clarification.
 It says that while he was praying,
 his face was transformed.
 And while he was praying and his face was transformed
 it came what was inside of him
 to shine through his life.
 And we wish that what you have inside of you
 will shine through your life.
 And that your face will shine with love.
 And that you will also have an understanding of eternity.
 It is quite exciting that while he was
 praying on the mountain of clarification
 he saw Elijah and Moses.
 I think that there has been a connection
 in the spirit that now there was an opening
 for a new union.
 It is important for us in the eternal perspective
 that we should not die, we should go home.
 We should move out of our limited bodies
 to get beautiful heavenly bodies
 that can carry his glory to the fullest.
 But I think that even here in time
 we should carry his glory.
 We should drink a lot from the smorgasbord
 so now we will have more praise
 But I just want to say welcome to you
 and I also want to hear if anyone is the first time
 on the Ark.
 Here we have a brother
 and you will get a book about
 the first 30 years of the Ark.
 We will celebrate the 40th anniversary soon.
 If you hold your hand up you will get a book
 about our history
 and some articles.
 Thank you Jesus.
 I just wanted to show you a picture
 from the Bible school if you have it on here
 because this is the last meeting
 and I just want to remind you
 to decide to take time at Jesus feet.
 I'm not sure how many thousands we have examined
 but I would count out maybe 5000
 So there have been many through the years
 but to decide to sit at his feet
 and love him
 at least for one year
 is a love statement.
 Sometimes people say we have too much to do
 but it doesn't matter
 Maria chose the good part
 and it should not be taken away from her.
 I don't want you to be on the spot
 but if you can't be on the spot
 you can be a distance student.
 You can change your image
 and you will see the heart in this Bible school
 and learn to know Jesus
 understand the reality of the resurrection
 and be grounded in the Word
 and be able to flow with the gifts of the spirit
 and that is important for us in the Arch
 whether we work with the mission, the evolution
 or with the souls
 and then we let love flow.
 So visit the Bible school
 go online and watch
 and then we work here all summer
 so we can't have the phone open
 every day because we give our staff a semester
 and on Tuesdays it is between 9 and 11
 and then on Tuesdays
 dinner is on the web
 so you can send in your meal items
 but on the phone you meet someone
 who serves you and prays for you
 and then we have meetings here every Wednesday
 every Sunday the whole center is a bit closed
 but we will start soon
 and we will come to Uppsala
 sometime in August
 but we will continue
 and then we will have a big conference
 in September called the Holy Spirit
 in you, above you and through you
 and then we will look at the Holy Spirit
 and how he can manifest
 and what the spirit does in human life
 because we want to prepare to be free
 in the Holy Spirit and we don't want
 to say no to the Holy Spirit
 do you think we should do that?
 So if you want to cry, you cry
 if you want to laugh, you laugh
 if you laugh too loud, you have to go a bit away
 if you want to dance, you fall under the smudge
 then you stay because we have filters
 and we can put them over you
 and then we have put up some chairs
 where are they?
 are they the ones who have taken away the chairs?
 who took them?
 we put them back again
 it's like the chairs that we had put up
 that suddenly disappeared
 they are for you who are ill
 and you absolutely don't want to fall
 you don't want that
 then they may tighten you
 so this is the meaning that we have to put these chairs
 so now we take the chairs back
 it was someone angry
 but then you can feel that you are sitting here
 maybe I need to put myself in the chair
 and here it will solve a collective miracle smudge
 that you can just take a seat in the chair
 and we will have workers who also solve the smudge
 so that you can feel safe in the chair
 and get relaxed
 bring out as many chairs as you can find
 we work a lot with chairs here on the arch
 so that people can get a retreat feeling
 they are themselves with God
 so we have it every month
 and sometimes several times a month
 we take out our chairs
 thank you Jesus
 we praise you
 then we have said that
 and then we will take up a collection
 to the work of the arch
 and I think many of you like the work of the arch
 that you want to stand together with us
 I feel for my own part
 I want now in all the countries we work in
 to build a whole center
 that will be under the smudge
 the holy power of the spirit
 so the students who come now
 will also be able to follow me out in the world
 but also to other places around the north of course
 but I think
 I have many friends
 you may be a friend with us
 you may own a church with another congregation
 but if you want to support us you can become a partner
 then God will put our blessings in your heart
 and then you get a partner letter
 and we tell you what happens
 but now we will just take up a tax-owning gift
 I am so grateful for our staff
 I think Oscar that you have been in the service 16 times
 in Love Song
 do not need another applause
 and all our workers who have been with
 and asked in basically every meeting
 give them also an applause
 and all those who are not seen here
 and those who have been in Hamburg
 the tent in Hopporgen with all this
 I also want to say thank you dear sister
 give them an applause
 then we will do this now
 I will ask some workers to come forward
 and ask for our charity
 we can say thank you Jesus
 for the Lord has created this place
 I think it was a miracle
 we do not own the ark, it is Jesus who owns the ark
 so we believe that many
 future members of the congregation
 will want to connect with what we do here
 just praise the Lord
 thank you Lord, thank you for new members of the congregation
 thank you for partners, thank you for the sister
 who wants to stand together with us in different countries
 and help people
 we can stand together in Christ in body
 and love each other
 thank you for wanting to use us
 your hands, your feet, your eyes
 and your heart
 thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus
 so now you get the opportunity to sing the ark
 our national and international work
 I think I give a big gift
 we have the trust letter
 you get to pay when you get your salary
 and then you can give in our bank terminal
 down there with your card
 or you who are in Norway can go via BankGiro
 very happy about it
 I will be in Norway soon
 Finland I will also come to in January
 then you can be with us and sing this place
 and you can give via swish
 and you can give via BankGiro
 and we thank you here
 thank you God for the strength in the ark
 to continue to serve people
 and you should give us the grace of Jesus
 so we can be sustainable
 for many young employees who love you
 and the young generation who will be builders in the ark
 who will be with us to strengthen this place
 so come holy spirit
 come holy spirit, thank you Jesus
 did it feel good?
 it felt good
 then we give and then we sing the song
 and when we sing the song, just let the small journey flow
 then we will take up a collection to Heidi Baker's
 and then we will sing her
 and I think there is a lot of love left
 in the gift
 so that it will be good
 but first you go to the ark
 and then we go into the song
 and then we see what the Lord wants
 thank you, if you want to have the sacrifice of the faithful
 stretch out your hand
 Jesus
 we praise you Jesus
 thank you Jesus
 thank you Jesus
 thank you Jesus
 we are so thankful Jesus

 I have lived in the goodness of God
 all my life you have been faithful
 all my life you have been so, so good
 with every breath that I have made
 I have seen the face of God
 I love you Lord
 I love you Lord
 for your mercy never fails me
 oh my days
 I will be held in your hands
 from the moment that I wave them
 until they lay my head
 I will sing of the goodness of God
 all my life
 all my life you have been faithful
 so faithful
 all my life you have been so, so good
 with every breath that I have made
 I will sing of the goodness of God

 yes I will sing of the goodness of God
 cause your goodness is running after
 it's running after me
 your goodness is running after
 it's running after me
 with my life laid down
 I surrender now
 I give you everything
 your goodness is running after
 it's running after me
 your goodness is running after
 it's running after me
 your goodness is running after
 it's running after me
 with my life laid down

 all my days
 I've been held in your hands
 from the moment that I wake up
 until I lay my head
 I will sing
 of the goodness of God
 I love your voice
 you have led me through the fire
 in the darkest night
 you were close like no other
 I've known you as a father
 I've known you as a friend
 and I have lived
 in the goodness of God
 yes I have lived

 I have lived

 I have lived
 in the goodness of God
 I have lived
 in the goodness of God
 yes I have lived
 in the goodness of God
 Lord
 Thank you Lord
 Now we will go into your
 presence of the joy
 and we know Jesus that when you
 dosed and bathed and opened the
 heaven and I ask that
 everyone should see today
 that the heavens are already open
 and angels go up and down
 so I ask my siblings
 to feel strength
 to feel comfort
 to carry your presence and give
 to schools, workplaces, streets
 hospitals, wherever they work
 wherever they meet people
 they have their own chariot
 a holy chariot to sleep in
 so I ask the Holy Spirit that this conference
 all the meetings should bear fruit
 and therefore I also lift meetings
 that have been represented here
 leaders as pastors
 meetings that allow other meetings
 to be able to carry something of your
 presence and joy to their home meetings
 that they should be given space for the holy spirit
 and not hold back, limit
 but let the spirit flow in the same way
 as Jesus wishes
 so Holy Spirit help us
 to be free from all religiosity
 and captivity and human fear
 so our lives can lie on the altar
 for a higher purpose
 Thank you Jesus
 I have seen her heart
 I like so much to see people's hearts
 and I have seen her heart
 that she has put down her whole life to serve the Lord
 that there is no acting
 there is no self-proclaiming
 I have been in meetings
 when Heidi just came under the smorgasbord
 and just lies on the floor
 because it is the smorgasbord of the gods
 so she carries something
 that is not owned
 by this or that
 she is owned by God
 I think it is very beautiful
 because it creates in contact
 with her a freedom and respect
 for Jesus
 there is a lot of love in my heart
 I am very happy that she has been here
 very very happy
 I really love you
 I really love Jesus
 and if we love him
 all the fear is gone
 I also felt yesterday
 that when love comes
 completely wild in a meeting
 the Holy Spirit has full control
 you just feel the care
 from the Holy Spirit
 that no one should go bad under a star
 so now we will sing Heidi
 and her husband and their whole organization
 they have a very big organization
 and we love mission
 a lot of need, a lot of
 war, a lot of violence
 and they have lived there for many many many years
 and the Lord said that she can give a part of her time
 to travel around and to bless the body
 and gatherings around the world
 because Heidi Baker has an international service
 and I can not say that I will take for granted
 that she wants to come here
 she gets an invitation from all over the world
 to come to the Arch, so we appreciate that
 we do not do that, we appreciate it
 so now we will let the flow come
 and then you just write
 it goes out to her organization Iris
 but do not remember Iris and write it as Heidi
 so we know that this collection goes to her work
 in Mozambique and around the world
 and if you want to give an extra big gift
 then you just take Troslöfte as usual
 and down there is the terminal
 and you who are in Norway and Finland
 you can just send in and then you write on e-mail
 and if you want to quickly tell what you have sent in
 then you just send to the Arch an e-mail
 but you can be there to give in Finland
 Heidi Baker loves Finland and the Finns love Heidi Baker
 maybe somewhere else
 thank you that you are a partner with Heidi
 from other nations
 so my friends now you can give
 and thank God also, so it will be like a thank you
 for what God will do and we believe
 that God is conducting services from all over the world
 from different contexts
 that may not be so well known to us either
 for preparing Jesus for arrival
 and then we need to be free from all prejudices
 and all fear to come up on another level
 and prepare and this conference
 has as a theme prepared Jesus for arrival
 in the waiting room
 yes
 yes, is there
 then you get to see a video now
 and then we take the gift
 do you have the video up there
 yes, yes, then they are ready
 thank you Jesus
 thank you Jesus
 they will put it on in a while
 we have not stopped them, we let the collect flow
 I think it will come now
 I think it will come now
 we are the
 team of the
 United Nations
 with teams around the world being the hands and feet of Jesus
 demonstrating the power of love in action
 at Iris
 we are totally dependent on God
 for everything and we need and expect miracles
 of all kinds to sustain us
 witness just that
 God's miraculous provision in the face of persecution
 floods, cyclones, extreme poverty
 war and terrorism
 through it all we have stood firm
 keeping our eyes on Jesus
 knowing that there is joy beyond the suffering
 over 30 years
 Iris Global has provided millions of meals
 we have established schools
 churches, medical clinics
 and children's homes
 we have drilled wells and developed farms
 and embarked on countless outreaches
 to the unreached
 additionally our Stop for the One program empowers
 the most vulnerable by transforming lives
 one at a time
 this movement supports children
 classrooms as well as community projects
 that each impacts individuals and nations
 one of our biggest dreams
 is the building of Iris University in Pemba
 as the doors to the university open
 we believe it will be a beacon of hope
 and a lasting blessing to the people of Mozambique
 at Iris we believe
 that the Great Commission is at hand
 Jesus said, go and make disciples of all nations
 baptizing them in the name of the Father
 and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
 and at our Iris Harvard schools we have trained
 and sent out thousands of missionaries
 to share this glorious gospel
 and disciple believers all over the globe
 to all of you who have partnered
 prayed and supported Iris Global throughout these 30 years
 we say thank you
 your unwavering commitment has strengthened us
 in our mission to touch countless lives with the love of Christ
 from humble beginnings Iris Global
 has expanded into a worldwide movement
 over the last 30 years
 and so many around the globe have been inspired by
 Rollin and Heidi's simple message of stopping for the one
 and while we reflect and praise Jesus
 for all that he has done let us remember
 that this journey continues
 there are still lives to touch and souls to be saved
 and together let's press on
 for the best is yet to come
 Thank you Jesus
 Thank you Jesus
 Thank you Jesus

 Let the wind of your spirit blow.
 Let the wind of your spirit blow.
 Let the wind of your spirit blow.
 Let the wind of your spirit blow.
 Let the wind of your spirit blow.
 Let the wind of your spirit blow.
 Let the wind of your spirit blow.
 Let the wind of your spirit blow.
 Let the wind of your spirit blow.
 Let the wind of your spirit blow.
 Let the wind of your spirit blow.
 Let the wind of your spirit blow.
 Let the wind of your spirit blow.
 Thank you for oil.
 Even as we're worshipping.
 We're going to go back into worship after a little time in the Word.
 I just feel like some of you came and wow just turning this way for a reason.
 I feel like some of you came for a miracle.
 Just a miracle in your marriage, a miracle in your health.
 You came for a miracle.
 You need to be healed of cancer.
 Of hopelessness.
 Fear.
 Cutting.
 Cutting your self harm.
 Self harm.
 Bulimia.
 Anorexia.
 Anorexia.
 Oh there's...
 Yeah I met a woman with endometriosis.
 Endometriosis also.
 I feel like there's so many of you.
 You just came just in faith for your miracle.
 And so I asked Pastor Linda if we could have those soaking chairs.
 So instead of you waiting to the end of the service.
 You can come with a family member, a friend.
 And you can spend the whole service in those chairs.
 I feel like even as you're listening in the chairs.
 Over there, they're right over there.
 Just go over there.
 I seriously encourage you.
 Go on over there.
 If you need any kind of healing.
 And you just...
 It might be emotional.
 It might be physical.
 You could take a friend with you.
 And what we're going to do is just share the word.
 There might be some people from this team.
 They're not going to speak to you.
 But they might just come and lay their hands upon you.
 And at the end of the service.
 We're going to just go deep, deep, deep in worship again.
 Because everything that I've ever seen in the glories happened.
 When we fully focus on the Lord.
 We just get our eyes totally off of people.
 And God uses people.
 So why are we going to lay hands on you?
 But it's there's something that happens when you just go deep.
 And you just go deep.
 And you just go deep.
 And you just go deep.
 And you just go deep.
 But it's there's something that happens when you just focus on Jesus.
 You just focus on the Father.
 And you allow Holy Spirit to fill you.
 That the most miraculous things happen.
 So that's how we're going to minister tonight.
 And my favorite way of doing things is when I can even if I leave the meeting.
 When I ever feel led to leave the meeting.
 And no one even notices.
 That's my most favorite.
 All eyes on Jesus.
 All hearts on Jesus.
 Holy Spirit I thank you for your fire.
 I thank you for your power.
 I thank you for two winged birds.
 Hey the power.
 Love.
 Power and love.
 Comes from you.
 Comes from you.
 Here we go.
 Yes I knew it.
 We need more chairs.
 I heard it.
 I was meeting my new friend today.
 I was like she came for healing.
 And I feel like as we just go in this whole service we go in.
 Put your chair back.
 Just go ahead be comfortable.
 Some of you only if they know you here.
 They may feel led to put their hands on you.
 I just want to say thank you.
 For sharing your gift.
 It's just so beautiful.
 It's so beautiful.
 It's just extraordinary.
 The thing that makes it so extraordinary is
 you don't just have the voice.
 You have this trained voice that's so incredibly beautiful.
 It just shivers.
 You just yielded to the Lord.
 You just give in to God.
 I just had to thank you.
 It's just a joy.
 I'm very inspired.
 Thank you.
 My mother was an opera singer.
 I went to the opera since I was three years old.
 I didn't always appreciate it.
 I was so little.
 But it was just to hear somebody so trained and so anointed.
 And so holy given to God.
 It just touched my heart.
 I just love that.
 Keep going.
 All for Jesus.
 He does give people different gifts and talents.
 I love to sing.
 I kind of like our dear pastor here.
 I kind of toasted my vocal cords.
 I know.
 They'll come back.
 So right now it's like octaves down low.
 That's all I got.
 But I love to worship.
 I love to worship.
 I have a funny story.
 I was looking at you play and looking at you two sing.
 When you were playing and you two were singing.
 I looked at this.
 What are the churches?
 I'll just say it really fast.
 One of the churches that I planted
 was in the UK.
 I planted this church while I was studying.
 Was it in Great Britain?
 I planted a church there.
 There were people that could play any instruments.
 We planted a church among PhD students
 and 12 lawyers.
 And 12 lawyers.
 Can you imagine?
 And also homeless people.
 We had no one that could play instruments.
 We planted a church there among these philosophy students.
 And the 10 lawyers were there.
 And the homeless.
 They'd come to church.
 They'd feed their rats on their tongues.
 They'd be speaking and feeding their rats.
 It was wild.
 Long story short.
 I studied cello for years.
 But because my mother had perfect pitch.
 I went for ballet.
 Because she would score a lot of great songs.
 And I was a great singer.
 And I was a great singer.
 I was a great singer.
 I was a great singer.
 And I was a great singer.
 And I was a great singer.
 And I was a great singer.
 Because she would scream.
 If I ever hit a note even slightly off sheet.
 And after four years of that I was like...
 I really tried but...
 Anyway.
 There's this little journey there.
 But I so wanted to just play something that I got an Omnicord.
 Do you know what that is?
 It's like a dreadful instrument.
 If you don't know how to play anything.
 You just push a button and it's just ding, ding, ding.
 And that's all we had.
 Me and my Omnicord.
 And one time.
 I'm going to lead worship.
 Because that was all we had.
 You know.
 And the Omnicord didn't work.
 And I see these lawyers.
 And I see these lawyers.
 I see these lawyers.
 Snickering.
 Do you know that word?
 Snickering.
 Something happened to my instrument.
 Those guys broke it.
 They broke it.
 Because they just couldn't hear me playing it anymore.
 So they just broke it.
 No one's going to break your guys instrument.
 It's beautiful.
 But see we all have gifts.
 And if we hide our gifts then they're not going to be seen.
 It's not that we're trying to be seen.
 But the Lord shines through little people.
 Therefore little people.
 People.
 That are on this team.
 Without speaking.
 You're just going to lay hands on them for a bit.
 Maybe you'll sit next to them for a bit.
 God wants to flow through all of us.
 I'm going to share from the work.
 I'll go on this side.
 Second Corinthians.
 I'll just read quickly and then you'll read slowly.
 Second Corinthians 1.3.
 Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
 The Father of compassion.
 The Father of compassion and the God of all comfort.
 Who comforts us in all our troubles.
 So that we can comfort those in any trouble.
 We ourselves have received from God.
 The Lord Jesus Christ is our God and Father.
 The Father of compassion and the God of all comfort.
 He comforts us in all our troubles.
 So that we can comfort those in need.
 With the comfort we ourselves receive from God.
 You don't need to look at me.
 Just relax and take it.
 Just relax and take it.
 It's so wonderful.
 I think I had the most healing when I was on the floor just weeping.
 I think I got most healing just when I was on the floor crying.
 And this very anointed momma just held me.
 She just loved on me.
 And I cried buckets.
 I just cried so many tears.
 I think her outfit was all wet.
 And she didn't care.
 She just rocked me.
 So you see God comforts us.
 So you understand God.
 He comforts us.
 If you want to move over here, that would be great.
 If you want to move in here in the middle, you can do that.
 I like to look at you.
 It's fun if you want to move in the middle.
 If you want.
 It's fun if you move in the middle.
 Or not.
 Whatever you like.
 But this is great.
 This is great.
 Just just I'm going to share.
 And then we're going to have more people going over there to lay hands on.
 See we need each other.
 We can't do it by ourselves.
 We need each other.
 We need each other.
 This really helps a lot.
 It's so nice.
 I like to see people.
 I like to hold people.
 I like to hug people and see them.
 But we have been through some pain.
 We have been through some pain.
 All of us.
 Is anybody been through any pain?
 Yes.
 We've been through all kinds of pain.
 We've been through all kinds of pain.
 You saw the video.
 I mean I work.
 We've been living now 30 years in Mozambique.
 So we've seen a lot of pain.
 A lot of suffering.
 But I've also had pain and suffering.
 And I realized that God can use anything.
 Like we heard Pastor Linda that the Lord didn't wreck her vocal cords.
 But he used the experience in her life to take her deeper.
 And give her more compassion.
 And more just time in the presence.
 And that God can use anything.
 So we are, I think I'll share this.
 Our suffering, let's read it.
 For just as our suffering, the suffering of our suffering.
 The sufferings of Christ.
 Flow over into our lives.
 Also through Christ our comfort overflows.
 If we are distressed it is for your comfort and salvation.
 If we are comforted it is for your comfort.
 Which produces in you patient endurance and the same suffering we suffer.
 So over the years I've done a few conferences.
 Like Pastor said I travel one third of my life.
 Two thirds of the time I'm home in my comfort zone.
 Two thirds of the time I'm home in Mozambique.
 That's where my husband is.
 That's where about ten of our children are.
 We've got about 36 ground children there.
 It's home.
 That's where my fat dog lives.
 It's home.
 And home is a beautiful place.
 It's a beautiful place.
 Roland teased me one day.
 Roland told me one day.
 My husband.
 He's a very patient man obviously.
 He's a very patient man obviously.
 Yes.
 You should say yes.
 I think so.
 I got married when I was 20.
 I just so thankful that he blesses me to go this third of my life.
 That's a miracle.
 Sometimes he goes with me but usually he just blesses me especially now.
 He's like you go baby go.
 I'm going to take a nap.
 You just go.
 It's a blessing.
 It's a blessing.
 He said what if we had a conference called suffering and endurance conference.
 We talked the same as he said.
 Imagine if we had a conference called suffering and endurance.
 Suffering and endurance.
 We have that conference.
 We start it as a conference.
 Let's charge people to go to it.
 And then we get paid when people come there.
 Come on.
 Nobody wants to go to a suffering and endurance conference.
 But that's real because that's life.
 Life is like that.
 We were doing a podcast the other day.
 Matilda was interviewing me and the presence got just dropped in.
 He can't make it happen.
 It just blew up.
 But I was sharing about the life of Matilda.
 And I was just so happy.
 I was just so happy.
 I was so happy.
 I was so happy.
 I was so happy.
 I was so happy.
 I was so happy.
 But I was sharing about this impression that I had the very first time I went into this revival in a certain country.
 And I feel like sharing a little bit has to do with suffering and joy.
 I believe God wants to heal people today.
 Massively.
 Massively.
 He wants to set us free from a lot of pain.
 But there's something about suffering that I want to define a little bit.
 Sometimes people think the suffering the Lord gives us is physical.
 He can use anything.
 But I don't believe that's the suffering he's talking about.
 So I want to explain that to you.
 I was just undone by the Lord.
 And I was just weeping.
 And I was on my face.
 And what I was was a very burned out missionary.
 Burned out.
 Did not want to do missions at all.
 Completely exhausted.
 I did not like missions.
 I did not want to do missions.
 I love Jesus.
 He's perfect.
 I have no problems.
 The mission is done.
 The mission is done.
 I knew that I was called to be a minister and a missionary to go to Africa, Asia and England.
 Because the Lord visited me when I was 16 years old.
 I knew that I would become a missionary and a preacher and go to Africa, Asia and England.
 Because the Lord visited me when I was little.
 So we went to Asia.
 We had one lunch.
 We had one lunch together.
 And then we got married.
 We ate lunch one time.
 It was a date.
 I think it was a date.
 And then we got married.
 And then we went off to the mission field.
 And then we went out on the mission field.
 With a one way ticket.
 With a one way ticket.
 And 30 US dollars.
 And 30 US dollars.
 But maybe we're a little bit like a stray cat perhaps.
 Just a little. We didn't know it.
 We'll never tell anyone our needs.
 Off we go to save the world.
 Yeah!
 And we were so skinny.
 And so hungry.
 And we'd go home and my parents had resources.
 We would go home.
 It wasn't home.
 Home was wherever the field was.
 And my father, when Roland asked if he could marry me.
 He looks at him.
 So what do you do? Save souls.
 So what do you do?
 Do you save souls or what do you do?
 The word missionary was so pejorative.
 The word missionary had so many advantages.
 It was such a negative...
 I mean they were just like...
 It was such a negative word.
 They were just like...
 You're going to be poor.
 You're going to be...
 I mean they made me finish my first degree before I married Roland.
 But you're like...
 You're going to be poor and educated.
 Everything wrong.
 You're going to be poor and educated.
 Everything wrong, wrong, wrong.
 And Roland is like...
 Yeah!
 We're going to raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, lay hands on the sick.
 And Roland is like...
 We're going to wake up the dead, clean the spetsa, and pray for the sick.
 We're going to go by faith with nothing.
 We're going to go by faith.
 Yes!
 My...
 My...
 My bohemian parents were not happy.
 My bohemian parents were not happy.
 They were very not amused.
 They were very not amused.
 They were not at all happy about this.
 So if we ever came back...
 So skinny.
 And Roland lost seven wedding rings.
 They fell off.
 Roland lost seven wedding rings.
 They just fell off.
 You never get another gold one.
 You never get another gold one.
 Silver rings.
 I love you.
 He's now chubby.
 But not...
 It's not falling off.
 It's not falling off.
 We have plenty of access to food.
 We have plenty of access to food.
 Now we have food. Thank God.
 I asked Rebecca, is 9.3 million meals we gave away last year.
 I asked Rebecca, is 9.3 million meals we gave away last year.
 That's the glory of God.
 Jesus did that.
 Jesus did that.
 And the body of Christ.
 And the body of Christ.
 I love the body of Christ.
 I love the body of Christ.
 So he has plenty of food for everybody.
 So he has plenty of food for everybody.
 We probably didn't know.
 We were like stray cats.
 We looked at each other.
 She told me about it in the morning.
 She told me about it in the morning.
 We were just kind of looking around hoping
 Looking around hoping we would get an egg.
 Hoping that we can get an egg.
 Praying and fasting.
 Bathing and fasting.
 That's what we...
 Maybe we'll get an egg.
 Maybe we'll get an egg.
 We'll put it in the top ramen.
 Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah.
 We have two natural born children.
 They look a lot like y'all.
 They look just like you.
 Not like everyone else.
 You look more like our other kids.
 You look more like our other kids.
 But they look Scandinavian.
 But they look Scandinavian.
 They have blue eyes and my son has almost white hair.
 With blue eyes and my son has almost white hair.
 He is very light.
 The first time we came through Holland it was.
 We were on KLM.
 We came through Holland.
 The first time we went through Holland.
 Then he said,
 Mom, no one is staring at me.
 No one is staring at me.
 No one is staring at me.
 No one is staring at me.
 I look like them.
 He was so happy.
 He was so happy.
 I mean that's a different experience.
 It's a different experience.
 We put him in Indonesian school.
 We put him in Indonesian school.
 He went to Chinese school.
 We put him in African school.
 Hallelujah for the glory of God.
 Hallelujah for God's glory.
 It's not always wisdom.
 It's not always wisdom.
 But our hearts were right.
 We wanted him to learn the language.
 We wanted him to learn the language.
 Anyway back to my story.
 After all of these years.
 After all of these years.
 After all of these years.
 After all of these years.
 We were just burned out.
 We were just burned out.
 We were just burned out.
 We were just sick of
 We were just sick of being hungry.
 Being hungry all the time.
 Being hungry all the time.
 And by then we had 360 children in our care.
 By then we had 360 children in our care.
 And we had 1 helper.
 And we had 1 helper.
 We had 1 helper.
 And she was really burned down.
 And she was really burned down.
 And then we had
 No money to hire any staff.
 I was one volunteer from UK.
 And then one came later from Australia.
 Nobody was happy.
 Nobody was really carrying incredible joy.
 We were just hungry.
 And we were just tired.
 And so I miraculously got to this revival.
 And long story short,
 I was in the power of the spirit.
 And I saw a multitude.
 A massive multitude of people.
 And I mean in this particular church, this revival, nobody cared if you screamed.
 I screamed.
 No usher even took me out.
 I just screamed no.
 You're supposed to say yes to God, but I was no.
 But then he came to me.
 I had this impression.
 Of his face.
 Jesus.
 He's so beautiful.
 And I'm saying no to all the people.
 Because I know we can't even do the little tiny thing we're doing.
 We don't even have the strength for the little tiny thing we're doing.
 And so this no rose up in me.
 But his eyes changed everything.
 When his eyes looked at me, their eyes of burning fiery love.
 When you see them.
 He rips the no out of you.
 And he gave me his flesh.
 In this impression.
 His body's so bruised.
 But his eyes are so full of love.
 And I just took this flesh in my hands.
 And I thought when he asked me to feed the children.
 I'm thinking you cannot give flesh to a child.
 You cannot.
 It's raw.
 It's raw.
 It's flesh.
 It's out of his side.
 And then I just had enough strength.
 Enough faith.
 To just reach out to the first one.
 And I reached out.
 And when I stretched out.
 So it became bread.
 So it became bread.
 And I continued to pass it around.
 I was lost.
 They said I was lost in this impression.
 This encounter with for hours and hours.
 But then he said to me I died.
 That there would always be enough.
 Then he put next to his side.
 A cup.
 It was a poor man's cup.
 It wasn't jeweled like some of the paintings we see.
 Renaissance paintings.
 It looked more like half of a gourd like we have in Mozambique.
 And blood and water filled the cup.
 And he spoke to me.
 Heart to heart.
 I couldn't hear him.
 No lips moving. Just heart to heart.
 He said it is a cup of suffering.
 And he paused.
 A cup of suffering.
 And joy.
 Will you drink it?
 And I thought.
 What do you do when you see the eyes of his fiery love?
 You drink.
 So I drank.
 But then I did not expect him to ask me to do the next thing.
 He said give it to the children.
 How?
 How could you give?
 How could you give a cup of suffering to a child?
 And I don't understand what kind of suffering.
 He spoke to me.
 He spoke to me.
 It's not physical suffering that he is asking us to drink.
 He wants to heal people.
 He wants to heal people.
 How he does it, when he does it.
 I don't know how he understands.
 But I don't believe he is saying I just want you to feel physical pain.
 I don't believe that.
 I don't believe that he is saying that you should feel physical pain.
 What he wants from us.
 What he wants is that we participate in the suffering that led him to the cross.
 He went there.
 So that every orphan could come home.
 He went there so that every one of us could be saved.
 He went there because he loves us.
 That's why he went to the cross.
 And he says the suffering that we are to partake of
 is our eyes would see.
 That we would see the orphans, the broken, the sick, the sick.
 The dying.
 The oppressed.
 The ones who are hurting, the ones who are being sold.
 What about people in Sweden?
 Lonely, isolated.
 Suicidal, some of them.
 He wants to open our eyes.
 So we would be able to partake.
 That we would be able to see.
 And then we would know there is enough joy.
 That he can send us to the tribes, the tongues, the nations.
 That he can send us to our next door neighbor.
 That we are willingly given to God.
 Because he is worthy.
 And I died that there would always be enough.
 Yes Lord, yes Lord.
 And since that day,
 I have never ever wanted to give up on missions again.
 Not once.
 Not one time.
 I said, God will give our lives.
 Including the one third of my time to the one third world.
 The two thirds that I have given to.
 I just want to give fresh bread every day.
 That is the bread he gives me.
 I want to eat Jesus and drink Jesus.
 Eat and drink Jesus.
 And give him more.
 Now I am moving on.
 He will give us great endurance and patience.
 And our hope for you is firm, Paul said.
 Because we know that just as you share in our sufferings,
 so you will also share in our comfort.
 So there is something beautiful I want to say.
 Beautiful about fasting.
 It is not always the favorite subject.
 But fasting is beautiful.
 But you don't fast to get God's favor.
 You have God's favor.
 If you are born again, Spirit filled and yielded to God.
 You fast to get hungry.
 To understand hunger.
 Hunger is a powerful thing.
 Hunger for God is powerful.
 Why I love it when we can all come forward at the altar call
 and just hunger for God.
 Just like, ah, just like.
 You have God's favor.
 I love it when we can all come forward and just hunger for God.
 I want you.
 I want you.
 I always feel like the hungriest person in the room.
 I want fresh bread.
 And I eat and drink of him.
 I just want more.
 And the more you taste of him, the more you want him.
 The more you just behold him.
 The more you want to give everything.
 Not just once.
 Not just a few times.
 Your entire life.
 Holy given to God.
 He died that there would always be enough.
 Enough.
 He died that there would be enough.
 Indeed our lives had felt the sentence of death.
 But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves
 but on God who raises the dead.
 He has delivered us from such deadly peril
 and he delivers us.
 He will deliver us.
 On him we have set our hope.
 On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us.
 Yes, within us we would have already received the sentence of death.
 Because we would not trust ourselves
 but God who awakens the dead.
 From such a death he saved us.
 And he will save us again.
 Our hope to him is that he will continue to save us.
 He will deliver us.
 He will do miracles.
 He will take us out of darkness and bring us into the light.
 And he will send us out to the world.
 I always say send us out to the world.
 Send me across the street or around the world.
 But we can't do it alone.
 We need each other.
 We need the body of Christ.
 Do we need the body of Christ?
 That's why this prayer team is just gently laying hands on people.
 We need the body of Christ.
 And their anointing breaks the yoke.
 Oh how I love him.
 We need the body of Christ.
 He gives us love for each other.
 I want to tell a quick story.
 It's a story about
 testimony time at my church.
 We didn't used to do this
 but now we kind of figured it out.
 But we didn't interview anybody.
 Who wants to share a testimony?
 And this little lady came up.
 She never held a microphone.
 She holds it.
 So she spoke in Makua
 or Makonde, I can't remember.
 And then it went into Portuguese.
 And then we had visitors there so
 we didn't have these amazing little devices.
 I was the third one into English.
 And you get this.
 Sometimes I say just change the translation.
 You need to, you can't.
 So here comes the lady says
 I've always hated my husband.
 Hated him.
 Horrible hated him.
 So this lady says I've always hated my husband.
 He's a horrible, horrible man.
 I've always hated him.
 And then it goes into Portuguese.
 And then I have Rivel.
 I have Kofi Karakueli.
 And then comes to me.
 I'm just supposed to be translating.
 I'm going to interpret them.
 This is bad.
 This is bad testimony.
 This is bad.
 He called me a prostitute
 because we couldn't have children
 and he was mean to me.
 He beat me.
 Then he died.
 Goes to the next translation.
 Then goes to me.
 We need interviewers.
 We need people.
 We need interviewers when we take the witness burden.
 And she just kept going. It was very uncomfortable to interpret.
 I wanted to change what she said.
 She had only been to church a few times.
 She can't read.
 She can't write.
 She hasn't been to any supernatural school, Bible school.
 Mission school, any Harvard school,
 no kind of school anywhere at all.
 She does not read or write.
 She is a brand new baby.
 Just telling this congregation
 how much she has always hated her retinue husband.
 This is so not going well.
 I was thinking this is not good.
 I was a pastor and I was thinking, oh.
 She couldn't even say the word hallelujah.
 She said, he died and I was so happy.
 And the next guy said, yes.
 In Portuguese she died and I was so happy.
 He died.
 I was so happy.
 I thought since I came in this church
 and you told me and you hugietnamese
 and people hugged me
 that I should pray for him.
 She didn't even know theology.
 Bad theology.
 She said people hugged her.
 She felt the love of Jesus.
 She asked him in her heart.
 She explained all that that day.
 She said, so I prayed for him.
 And here he is.
 So you better, she looks at me like
 you better lead him to Jesus.
 You better lead him to Jesus.
 This man, he grabbed the mic and he said
 I promise to never beat my wife again.
 Hallelujah.
 This is, some of us think
 God reserves those big miracles
 for the people that did the 40 day fast
 the 50 day, the 60 day.
 They've been in ministry building their faith forever.
 We sometimes think that God reserved
 these miracles for those who fasted
 for 60 days and built a big church.
 But no.
 He did it for this lady.
 She still had bitterness in her.
 She didn't even like him.
 She didn't even know how to lead him to Jesus.
 Do you think he got born again?
 Yes, he did.
 He never beat her again.
 Holy is the lamb.
 That's our God.
 I get shivers on.
 He can do anything through anyone.
 I'm saying he can do anything through anyone.
 We need Pastor Linda to lay hands on us.
 She's anointed.
 But God can use anyone.
 And he wants to heal you.
 He wants to touch you.
 He wants to fill you.
 He wants to fill you with love.
 And holiness.
 We release healing on.
 The power that raises people from the dead.
 The glory of God
 is released all over you.
 He that takes away every kind of fear and pain.
 Oh, son to Deus
 that allows you to have courage to go to the ends of the earth.
 Or across the street.
 Holy is the lamb.
 There's going to be testimonies out of this time.
 Holy is the lamb.
 The next lady comes up.
 And she is tatted up.
 Tattoos.
 All on her face.
 Beautiful beauty marks.
 Her whole face is marked with these marks.
 She makes me look tall.
 That's a miracle.
 So I'm looking at her. I'm also the third one.
 So she said
 I was going to kill my family.
 And eat them.
 Unlike
 I'm thinking we've just barely got through the first testimony.
 This is my church Sunday morning.
 She's like I'm going to kill my family.
 And eat them.
 And now it goes into Portuguese.
 And now I'm going to have to be number three.
 So I look at the other
 I think I missed something.
 I think I got like
 Say it again.
 And I speak that dialect.
 So I'm like we're talking.
 They're doing what?
 And she said yeah.
 But somebody hugged me.
 Somebody held her.
 And then she said just like this.
 She had a microphone.
 And she said
 Someone hugged me.
 And now I'm not going to eat my family.
 And then she dropped it.
 Bam like that.
 And she just walked off.
 Come back.
 Come back.
 Prayer team.
 Go lay hands on her.
 She needs a little more.
 She needs a little more.
 What?
 She's going to eat her family.
 Real story.
 Because in the witchcraft
 If you eat a heart
 You get a heart. You eat an eye.
 You get an ear. You get a hearing.
 Whatever.
 This was dark stuff.
 Whoa! In a moment.
 In a moment.
 She knew she couldn't kill her family.
 She could not eat her family.
 This is where this comes down
 to what we're talking about here in Sweden.
 When we
 speak about
 the body of Christ
 different denominations, different people
 different people
 that we don't agree with
 and we're hurting them with our words.
 We are eating our
 family.
 We are eating our family.
 And God wants us to stop it.
 We can't eat our family anymore.
 We don't have to agree with our family.
 We don't have to agree with all of the things
 they believe.
 But when Christ is the head
 But when Christ is the head
 Then we have no business chewing up our family.
 We have no right to chew on our family.
 We are the body of Christ.
 We need each other.
 When we chew on someone
 it's like we're beating ourselves in the head.
 When we speak of pain
 it's like we're kicking ourselves.
 And the Lord says that love wins.
 I'm not talking about kumbaya love.
 All theology is fine.
 All faith leads to heaven.
 Kumbaya!
 Kumbaya!
 No!
 I'm not talking about that.
 He is the only way.
 Christ is the only way to the Father.
 He is the only way.
 But there is something
 that he is asking of the body of Christ.
 That he has been praying about.
 John 17.
 The prayer of Jesus.
 Praying that we would be one.
 As he and the Father are one.
 So the entire world would know we are Christians.
 So the entire world would know we are Christians.
 Through our love.
 Come on! It's powerful!
 It's powerful!
 It's powerful!
 Love wins!
 Love wins!
 He wins!
 He is our hope!
 We set our hope on him.
 He delivers us.
 He helps us.
 We give thanks to him.
 We give thanks to him.
 Rabah Shikriya.
 Many will give thanks.
 Many will give thanks.
 On our behalf.
 For the gracious favor granted us
 in answer to prayers of many.
 Verses 11.
 When you also help us with our prayer,
 many people will come to thank God for us.
 For the grace we have received.
 He delivers us.
 He delivers us from deadly peril.
 He delivers us from deadly peril.
 He frees us from every struggle.
 He sets hope inside our hearts.
 He sets hope inside our hearts.
 And this hope causes us to stand firm.
 And this hope causes us to stand firm.
 No matter how many promises
 No matter how many promises
 that have been given.
 that have been given.
 God has made
 I'm going to read it.
 I'm going to read it.
 Or you can read it.
 For the son of God, Jesus Christ,
 who is preached among you by me
 and Silas and Timothy,
 was not yes and no.
 But in him it has always been a yes.
 For no matter how many promises
 God has made,
 they are yes in Christ.
 And so through him
 the amen is spoken
 by the glory
 by us to the glory of God.
 Verse 20
 Now it is God who makes both
 us and you stand firm.
 It is God who makes both
 us and you stand firm.
 In Christ.
 He makes us stand firm
 In Christ.
 And he has anointed us.
 And he has anointed us.
 Oh, Katayanaia,
 he has anointed us.
 He has anointed us.
 And then he set a seal
 of ownership on us.
 And then he set a seal of ownership on us.
 I just feel
 I feel like this is what we're meant to do right now.
 I feel like this is what we're meant to do right now.
 I would love this beautiful
 worship team to come.
 The Lord
 wants to seal us.
 The Lord wants to seal us.
 And there is a seal
 of ownership.
 And there is a seal of ownership.
 And often, you know,
 we speak that we are
 abolitionist.
 We want to see people set free
 from slavery.
 We want to see people set free from slavery.
 But there is a difference
 But there is a difference
 But there is a difference
 between being
 just taken
 as a slave
 and being given
 and being given
 and being given
 I'll tell you
 in this, slavery is outlawed
 in Mozambique.
 But I did come across
 a slave, she was in the video.
 And this woman was
 seriously enslaved.
 And this woman was
 seriously enslaved.
 And her slave
 master was
 a witch doctor.
 This story
 means a lot to me.
 This story means a lot to me.
 Because I could just tell you
 I could just tell you everybody else's story
 or I could tell you my story.
 I can't tell
 Pastor Linda's story.
 I can't tell Pastor Linda's story.
 I can tell you my story.
 So I'm in my tent.
 You are in many tents.
 You are in many tents.
 My little pup tent.
 And I'm out in the village.
 I love it. I love it. I love it.
 Sharing the gospel.
 And someone comes running
 into my tent.
 They can't run in.
 They just duck down and say, hey, hey!
 There's a man here to kill you.
 There's a man here to kill you.
 He's got three snakes.
 This will be a funny translation.
 This will be a funny translation.
 But you're just so good you'll get it.
 Hot dog is what I said.
 Hot dog!
 Yes!
 I was excited.
 That's not wisdom.
 That's not wisdom.
 That's not wisdom.
 Oh yeah, I got shivers all over me.
 I was like...
 Shaka Baba, I know what's going to go down.
 Shaka Baba, I know what's going to go down.
 I mean, I know what's going to go down.
 I do respect.
 I know they have dark power.
 I put on Ephesians 6 armor every single day.
 I do respect.
 I know they have dark power.
 I put on Ephesians 6 armor every single day.
 I'm not flipping about this.
 Hey!
 You gotta be armored up, oiled up,
 armored up, oiled up,
 oiled up.
 So I'm armored up oiled up.
 I've already been listening to the Bible for hours.
 I've already been listening to the Bible for hours.
 Why?
 Because I can't read it, because there's no electricity.
 I'm listening.
 I'm armed up.
 I wanted coffee.
 I like to make coffee for everybody.
 I like to make coffee for everybody.
 But there was no time for coffee.
 I like go out and here's this man with these three snakes.
 I like go out and here's this man with these three snakes.
 And he's hissing at me.
 And he's hissing at me.
 And he's hissing at me.
 And I said,
 You're tired.
 You're so tired.
 I looked at him and I just said,
 You're so tired.
 And he looked at me and he said,
 You're so tired.
 I said, No, no, no.
 I'm right.
 You're tired.
 He's got these snakes.
 They bite him.
 He has three worms.
 They bite him.
 They don't die.
 They're venomous.
 They're venomous.
 He's a terrible man.
 He said,
 He ate the worst things.
 He ate a crocodile.
 He ate a crocodile.
 It was so he got power.
 It's too much information.
 It's real.
 It's my world.
 It's real.
 So I look over here.
 So I look over here.
 And I see a little woman.
 And I don't know how connected they are.
 And I don't know how connected they are.
 But he's staring at her.
 And she's obviously there together.
 But he's staring at her.
 And they're obviously there together.
 And that woman,
 who you saw in the video,
 you didn't know it,
 she had oozing, running leprosy.
 And she is,
 she is
 she has
 got these big sores on her arms,
 and her legs.
 And the Lord spoke to me.
 And the Lord spoke to me.
 And the Lord spoke to me.
 He tells me to do things like you.
 Different ways of doing it.
 One time I met a leper in the street of Maputo.
 One time I met a leper in the street of Maputo.
 One time I met a leper in the street of Maputo.
 And that man,
 And that man,
 I stomped on his foot.
 I squeezed his gooey hands.
 I squeezed his gooey hands.
 And he screamed.
 And he screamed.
 And that's how I knew he was healed.
 That doesn't sound nice.
 That doesn't sound nice.
 But if the Lord tells you to do it, you do it.
 But if the Lord tells you to do it, you do it.
 He was powerfully healed.
 Because they lost the feeling in their nerves.
 Because they lost the feeling in their nerves.
 That's how I knew he was healed.
 I did hug him after I stomped on his foot.
 I did hug him after I stomped on his foot.
 But I ran towards the smell
 But I ran towards the smell
 of that leper.
 This is not a vision.
 This is not a vision.
 This is real, real, real man walking around.
 This is real, real, real man walking around.
 This is real, real, real man walking around.
 This is a real nail.
 This is a real man with snakes
 and a real leper slave.
 The Lord told me with her,
 The Lord told me with her,
 He said just kiss her hands.
 He said just kiss her hands.
 Just kiss her hands.
 Just hold her, love her.
 Kiss her.
 And I'm just like holding her hands
 and I'm kissing her.
 She only has stubs, no fingers.
 I'm like holding her, kissing her.
 I'm like holding her, kissing her.
 And this is why.
 And this is why.
 See God knows why.
 And the devil could try to talk to you
 and say you're going to get leprosy.
 Or those snakes are going to kill you.
 Or those snakes are going to kill you.
 You've gone too far this time.
 But I knew, I knew,
 I just needed to kiss her hands.
 I'm holding her
 and he's watching me.
 And he's watching me.
 And he's watching me.
 And I know this was the key.
 I don't believe he would have done
 what he did if I had done what I did.
 So he's watching me kiss his slave,
 So he's watching me kiss his slave,
 And he's looking at me
 And he's looking Table,
 And I said we're going to have to kill your snakes
 And he said we're going to have to kill your snakes
 And he says we're going to have to kill your snakes
 I spoke one way to him
 Pretty tough.
 pretty tough.
 Not like, oh honey, sweetie pie, let me just kill your snakes.
 I prefer that you don't sick them on me.
 They'll all die and that won't be good.
 No, that's not how I talked to him.
 I said, I'm going to have to burn your snakes.
 And so I got a, I asked who has a machete.
 And I started digging a hole.
 And my sons grabbed it from me.
 They thought I was too old to dig a hole.
 I said, I'd like to dig a hole.
 First I want to just whack their heads of the snakes off.
 Why? Because I've done it before and it's really fun.
 And so I wanted to whack their heads off.
 I want to just whack their heads off.
 It is fun because they're dead.
 Thank you Jesus, we're more than conquers in Christ.
 I feel Holy Spirit all over me.
 So I was like, I just whack.
 One of my kids, one of my sons said, Mom.
 That's not what we're doing with these snakes.
 We're going to burn these snakes.
 At least let me dig the hole.
 They let me do like one scoop.
 Then I had to give them the machete.
 We put fuel in that hole.
 Sticks in that hole.
 And then I just said, in the name of Jesus.
 And the three snakes slithered right into the hole.
 Holy is the Lamb.
 This is true.
 This is what my God can do.
 I don't know what kind of slavery that you're faced with.
 In Sweden.
 In Finland.
 In Norway.
 But it's real.
 I don't know what kind of how many orphans you come across in Finland, Sweden, Norway.
 But it's real.
 Because anyone who doesn't know Jesus.
 Is an orphan.
 And anyone who doesn't know what the blood of Jesus does to cleanse us from all sin.
 Is like a leper.
 In the Old Testament you touch the blood of Jesus.
 In the Old Testament you touch the leper, you die.
 In the New Testament you touch a leper.
 And they're healed.
 Holy is the Lamb.
 Holy is the Lamb.
 I just feel Holy Spirit on this.
 I was so excited.
 I had his name Jose.
 Her name is Albertina.
 I had him jump in my truck.
 I took him right up to a baptismal place.
 We walked down to the old hole.
 And I had a little boy.
 Name Bacheco.
 And a pastor had just come back to the Lord.
 And I mean he'd come back to the Lord.
 I'm like you're ready.
 Don't you want some of the more strong ones?
 I said no, we're demonstrating something.
 We're demonstrating that when Jesus' blood covers us, we are covered.
 And a little boy.
 Can pray for the sick.
 And a pastor who's just come back to holiness.
 Can pray.
 And so I said okay, we're going to pray.
 And so I said okay, let's get in the water.
 Dirty water.
 You saw it in the video.
 That was the guy, but that time he was baptizing other people.
 I wanted to tell you what was going on in the video.
 You saw that man.
 And you saw his slave who's no longer a slave.
 I was sitting next to her in one of the shots.
 She's totally completely healed.
 But the first time I went back six weeks later she wasn't healed.
 I'll tell you what happened.
 The devil himself tried to talk to me.
 He said, now you've got leprosy.
 And when you're in California, or you're in some Nordic country,
 they're not going to know how to do anything about leprosy.
 And you're in trouble.
 You went too far.
 And I said no in the name of Jesus.
 No in the name of Jesus.
 I can touch a leper.
 And they will be healed.
 And she still had sores all over her.
 And I said, no, I can touch a leper.
 And she still had sores all over her.
 And the Lord said, kiss her.
 Hands again.
 Kiss her arm.
 Again.
 Hold her again.
 I said, yes Lord.
 And I kissed her again.
 And there were military police.
 They came and they summoned me back to that village.
 And I'm there.
 Thank you sweetheart.
 I'm there.
 And these military police summoned me and they were all occupied.
 They had all their machine guns.
 Hey, there were a bunch of them.
 And they were there.
 Just receive your healing.
 Receive your healing.
 And they said, mama.
 They called me mama right away.
 We are all going to be saved.
 We are all going to follow Jesus.
 They said to me, hallelujah, yes you should rejoice.
 Hallelujah, yes we are glad to hear that.
 They said to me, we watched you.
 We saw you with that little boy.
 I feel the Holy Spirit so strong.
 They said, we watched you with that little boy.
 We saw you with that little boy.
 We watched you with that little boy.
 We watched you little, little, little,
 they said little white woman.
 With that little boy.
 He is a Mozambican.
 He used to be an orphan. Now he is adopted by the father.
 They said, we watched you.
 We watched you with that little boy.
 That skinny man.
 We saw you with that little boy.
 That skinny man.
 You put our greatest problem.
 That we ever had.
 You put him under the water.
 We don't know how, how, how come you didn't die.
 We don't know how he didn't die.
 You pushed him under the water.
 They said you pushed him under the water.
 And he is no longer our problem.
 He is no longer a problem to us.
 He is no longer a problem to us.
 And I'm thinking,
 they just saw his testimony.
 But I'm still there and I'm thinking
 a little bit in the natural.
 Thinking but the leper slave is no longer a slave.
 But I'm thinking but the leper slave is no longer a slave.
 And they said, they said she is no longer a slave.
 And I'm thinking but she still has lepers.
 But that didn't stop them from receiving Jesus.
 But that didn't stop them from receiving Jesus.
 They received Jesus because they saw
 what he could do.
 Because they said that man was so feared.
 And now there is no fear.
 They say we don't have any problems
 in the village anymore.
 I'm looking around thinking you,
 looks like you have all kinds of problems in the village.
 But okay.
 And I pray for this lady again.
 And a few weeks later I'm driving down the road.
 On another outreach.
 Another one.
 And I wanted tangerines.
 Tangerines like orange.
 And I wanted them really.
 And I saw some on the side of the road.
 And I stopped.
 My truck was just full of the
 ministry team, some little children, ten, eleven.
 Some pastors.
 Whoa! I stopped.
 And this lady comes running across the street.
 She does something you never ever ever do.
 And most of you don't.
 She pulled up her sleeve like this.
 That's like a scandal.
 She pulled up her
 capalana.
 And she's running across the road.
 La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.
 Just like that she's running across the street.
 La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.
 Just like that she says, it's me.
 Albertina.
 It's me.
 Look at my arms.
 Look at my legs.
 She says I'm totally healed.
 Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
 He left the scars.
 Completely.
 Some of you have had prayers many times.
 We did just pray for Albertina once.
 We prayed for Albertina once.
 But oh, Jesus healed her.
 And the beautiful miracle of all miracles.
 And the beautiful miracle of all miracles.
 Were those two.
 Nobody ever wanted to be near them.
 No one ever wanted to be near them.
 Because no one will want to be close to a witch doctor.
 Because no one will want to be close to a witch doctor.
 And no one wants to be near a leper.
 But when Jesus
 But when Jesus
 set them free,
 their biggest problem
 was they didn't have room
 for all the family that wanted to be around them.
 Holy, holy is the Lamb.
 Holy, holy is the Lamb.
 Oh, Jesus causes us
 to stand firm.
 He's our healer.
 He's our redeemer.
 Oh, would you partake of His cup.
 You will see the people
 that are in need.
 And you will love them.
 And tonight,
 out of just great adoration,
 great thanksgiving,
 we are going to face
 forward.
 If you want to go low,
 you go low.
 I like getting low.
 Because it's a place of humility.
 It's a place of humility.
 God can knock you down
 from your knees.
 You can get holy fire from your knees.
 But there's something about a posture
 of humility
 that touches the heart of God.
 So we are going to worship
 for the next 15-20 minutes.
 We are going to go up
 and in.
 I believe that anybody
 if you need to go now, this is your moment.
 You can feel free now.
 We're going to worship
 about 20 minutes.
 If you want to make your way out of the building,
 the Lord bless you,
 keep you,
 make His face shine upon you,
 be gracious unto you,
 and give you peace.
 When we, now you just feel free,
 one thing we're not going to do,
 not a single one that feels called to you
 for the next 18 minutes.
 We are not going to spectate.
 If you need to talk to your friends,
 just meet them out there in the fellowship hall.
 We are going,
 those of us who are called to stay,
 by the way, you're not less spiritual
 if you leave.
 We are going,
 by the way, you're not less spiritual
 if you leave.
 You know why,
 and it's not less spiritual.
 But if you're staying,
 for these next 17 minutes,
 I want us to all
 come forward, everybody.
 You precious ones being healed,
 you who are sitting in these beautiful soaking chairs,
 I want everybody else
 just coming forward.
 Let's get low,
 and the annoying thing as we worship
 is going to get thick.
 So thick in this place.
 The Lord is going to send you
 to the lepers,
 to the untouchables,
 to people that
 you think don't even want to hear your message.
 In your country,
 they're not physically
 dying of starvation.
 In your country,
 they're not physically
 in shredded rags.
 In your country,
 they're not physically
 bringing snakes into your church.
 But it's all here.
 Because in your country,
 people,
 they can hide it.
 But they are poor.
 They are wretched.
 They are blind.
 They are lame.
 They have leprosy,
 and darkness.
 And if you do not stop for them,
 as the Lord speaks to you to stop for them,
 they will die.
 They seriously will die.
 And there will be no recovery for them.
 For all eternity.
 They will be lost.
 And the Lord says,
 He wants to speak to us.
 He wants to call us to mission.
 He wants to call us to lay our lives down.
 I am going to ask the ones going forward
 to get low, to lay your life down.
 To just say,
 drink the cup of suffering.
 Just see what you see.
 To do what you do.
 Send me.
 Here I am.
 Send me across the street.
 Around the world.
 I'm going to go Lord.
 I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
 Fire, fire, fire.
 This beautiful team.
 I don't want any background music.
 We're going up into the glory.
 And the Lord is going to come with His power.
 His holy fire is going to touch people.
 His healing is touching people.
 If you can get low, get low.
 You can't get low.
 You can't get low, get low.
 You can't get low, you can get in one of these chairs.
 If you need to go home, go home.
 Be blessed.
 Thank you for caring.
 Thank you for being here.
 Let's worship.
 Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire.
 Fire of the God, fire of God, fire of God.
 Thank you for the shield we pay.
 Bearing all my sin and shame.
 Worthy is to laugh.
 From your tears, you gave amazing grace.
 Thank you for this love, Lord.
 Thank you for the love.
 Thank you for the love.
 Let all I know,
 your forgiveness and grace.

 If you just get your eyes totally fixed on Jesus

 I want to sing the next song in your heart language.
 Oscar will hear.
 We go up now.
 And we give ourselves.
 We give everything to God.
 And his presence will fall.
 He will just take us.
 To a different dimension.
 He will put radical love inside of us.
 He will take us.
 To a holy place.
 And we are going to become.
 Holy healed.
 This is a Kairos moment.
 Let's go up.
 All eyes on Jesus.
 She are our Savior.
 She is our Savior.
 She is our Savior.
 She is our Savior.
 Jesus is our Savior.
 She is our Savior.
 Jesus is our Savior.

 I'm a teacher at the Aiken Wimme School.
 I longed for you to discover how loved you are,
 the Heavenly Father,
 and what freedom it means to be a beloved child of God.
 See you!
 Your heart received a response.
 In my book you will follow me
 in my teenage years of acceptance and in adulthood,
 into a miraculously transformed life
 together with Jesus Christ.
