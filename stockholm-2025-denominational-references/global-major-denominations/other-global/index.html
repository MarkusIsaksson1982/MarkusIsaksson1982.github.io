  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This category encompasses Christian denominations and movements not included in the primary global families (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Anglican, Pentecostal). 
    Examples include Adventist, Anabaptist, Oriental Orthodox beyond major jurisdictions, independent evangelical networks, and emerging global movements. 
    Membership varies widely, with local, regional, and international structures.
  </p>

  <h2>Comparison Axes (from manifest)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ecclesiology:</strong> Highly diverse; ranges from congregational and networked governance to episcopal oversight; local autonomy often emphasized</li>
    <li><strong>Soteriology:</strong> Generally salvation by grace through faith, often with emphasis on personal conversion, discipleship, and ethical living</li>
    <li><strong>Sacramental/Ordinance Theology:</strong> Varies by tradition; can include believer‚Äôs baptism, infant baptism, Lord‚Äôs Supper, or other ritual observances; spiritual gifts recognized differently</li>
    <li><strong>Social Ethics:</strong> Mission, education, healthcare, humanitarian work, peacebuilding, and social justice initiatives according to local and global priorities</li>
    <li><strong>Ecumenical Theology:</strong> Selective engagement; many maintain interdenominational cooperation while safeguarding doctrinal distinctives; participation in regional councils common</li>
    <li><strong>Global Context:</strong> Scattered worldwide; often connected by fellowship networks, mission agencies, or theological schools; adaptable to local cultures and contemporary issues</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p class="notes">
    Core documents may include denominational statements of faith, regional fellowship guidelines, and organizational constitutions.
