  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Anglican Communion is a worldwide fellowship of churches in the Anglican tradition, with approximately 85 million members globally. 
    It maintains episcopal governance, historic liturgy, and the via media approach‚Äîholding a balance between Catholic and Protestant theological emphases. 
    The Archbishop of Canterbury serves as the spiritual leader and symbol of unity, without exercising papal-style authority.
