  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Roman Catholic Church is the world‚Äôs largest Christian communion, centered on communion with the Bishop of Rome (the Pope). 
    With over 1.3 billion members worldwide, it emphasizes continuity with apostolic tradition, sacramental life, and a global mission of evangelization and service.
  </p>

  <h2>Comparison Axes (from manifest)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ecclesiology:</strong> Papal primacy, episcopal governance, magisterial teaching authority</li>
    <li><strong>Soteriology:</strong> Grace through Christ; justification involves faith, works, and sacraments</li>
    <li><strong>Sacramental Theology:</strong> Seven sacraments as visible signs of grace</li>
    <li><strong>Social Ethics:</strong> Catholic Social Teaching ‚Äì human dignity, solidarity, subsidiarity, care for creation</li>
    <li><strong>Ecumenical Theology:</strong> Commitment since Vatican II; sees itself as the fullest expression of the Church while recognizing partial communion with others</li>
    <li><strong>Global Context:</strong> Universal reach, local enculturation, influence in education, health care, diplomacy, and humanitarian work</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p class="notes">
    Key documents include the Catechism of the Catholic Church, Vatican II (especially <em>Lumen Gentium</em> and <em>Unitatis Redintegratio</em>), and papal encyclicals. 
    In Sweden, the Catholic Church is represented by the Diocese of Stockholm.
