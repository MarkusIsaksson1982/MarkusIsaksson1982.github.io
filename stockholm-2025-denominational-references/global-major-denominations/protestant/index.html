  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The global Protestant family encompasses multiple denominations, including Lutheran, Reformed, Methodist, Baptist, and other evangelical and mainline traditions. 
    Membership is approximately 800 million worldwide. 
    Governance structures vary from episcopal (e.g., Methodist) to presbyterian and congregational models. 
    Protestant theology emphasizes scripture as primary authority, justification by faith alone, and the priesthood of all believers.
  </p>

  <h2>Comparison Axes (from manifest)</h2>
