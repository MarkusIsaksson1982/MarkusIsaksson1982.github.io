  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Orthodox Churches represent a communion of autocephalous (self-governing) churches rooted in the apostolic tradition. 
    With approximately 220‚Äì300 million members globally, they emphasize conciliar governance, liturgical continuity, and theosis (deification) as the ultimate goal of salvation. 
    The Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople holds the role of "first among equals."
  </p>

  <h2>Comparison Axes (from manifest)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ecclesiology:</strong> Conciliar authority, episcopal collegiality, autocephalous churches, Ecumenical Patriarch as honorary primate</li>
    <li><strong>Soteriology:</strong> Theosis: synergy of divine grace and human cooperation, mystical union with Christ</li>
    <li><strong>Sacramental Theology:</strong> Seven mysteries (sacraments), real presence in Eucharist, chrismation, married priesthood permitted</li>
    <li><strong>Social Ethics:</strong> Creation care, peace advocacy, traditional moral teaching, cultural preservation</li>
    <li><strong>Ecumenical Theology:</strong> Dialogue with Catholic, Anglican, Protestant traditions; unity through shared apostolic succession</li>
    <li><strong>Global Context:</strong> Autocephalous national churches (e.g., Russian, Greek, Serbian, Finnish), widespread diaspora communities, strong liturgical and monastic presence</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p class="notes">
    Key documents include the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, Canons of the Ecumenical Councils, and Patristic writings. 
    The Orthodox Churches maintain rich liturgical and theological traditions across multiple jurisdictions. 
    For Stockholm 2025, the Ecumenical Patriarchate is represented as an honored guest, alongside other Orthodox jurisdictions, connecting global Orthodoxy to local Swedish communities (~95K members).
