Let Your Glory hi I'm Apostle Catherine
Crick welcome to another episode of
Revival is now on the previous episode I
began to teach on the principle of
sewing and reaping this principle
applies to not just one area in your
life in your spiritual life but in
several on the previous episode I taught
about sewing financially and what that
reaping looks like and today you will
learn the other types of sewing and
reaping
so this principle of someone and reaping
comes from Galatians 6 7. do not be
deceived God cannot be mocked a man or
woman reaps what he sows this is a
serious business statement do not be
deceived God cannot be mocked whatever
you sow you will reap this is a
principle we can't get around it God
will not be mocked he's true to his word
he's true to his principles this is a
law in the spiritual realm another area
in your life where you can sow and Reap
is in your words and in your actions in
your everyday life do not be deceived
God cannot be mocked a man reaps what he
sows whoever sows to please their flesh
from the flesh will reap destruction
whoever sows to please the spirit from
the spirit will reap eternal life this
is talking about the other kind of
another kind of sewing sewing in your
actions your words your daily life the
devil knows the spiritual laws and
principles you cannot go against them he
cannot make up his own laws or rules God
God in his spiritual realm has his has
his principles and his rules and so some
of these things are just laws they're
it's not about asking God to do
something but you do this equals you'll
receive this
and that's what sewing and reaping the
principle is the devil likes to deceive
people to bring them into new age to
bring them into other spirituality
things
um and and introduce them to
Supernatural powers and principles where
they see they see things happen such as
manifesting people talk about
manifesting in the new age and meaning
I'm going to think on and speak this
into existence and they've seen the
results of things coming into existence
it's the principle in the kingdom of God
of speaking prophesying declaring God's
will what you want to happen according
to God's will that's something that God
teaches us to he teaches us to meditate
to write down a vision to speak things
declare things and doing this we're
taking Authority and we're seeing these
things happen because we're speaking
these things and believing in the power
of our words Jesus says to the disciples
if you tell the mountain move and you
believe that what you said will happen
it will happen well the devil likes to
speak to people in New Age and people
open to other religions this same
principle but without Jesus and this is
where manifesting comes from another one
is karma you might have heard of karma
karma is a new age belief that what goes
around comes around if you do good
people will be good back to you if you
if you do good on this Earth the
universe will bring good back to you if
you do bad then bad will come to you now
this is actually a principle that
they've stolen from the Bible from the
kingdom of God of sowing and reaping
whatever you sow you will reap you will
you could reap destruction depending on
what you sow or you could reap life good
things
so the people in the world are actually
seen and the people in the world are
actually seeing Effectiveness when they
follow these principles they're seeing
it happen they're really believing in
karma they really believe in manifesting
and it's because these are principles in
the spiritual realm these are laws it's
not once again it's not about you asking
for God and God doing something but it's
about applying a principle and it's it
will things will happen in the spiritual
realm but the difference is when you
give your life to Jesus then when you
apply his principles and his word this
leads you to Abundant Life
eternal life here and now
which means Abundant Life here and
forever the Bible says the blessings of
God come without sorrow so you apply
these principles of sowing and the
reaping is you walking in that Abundant
Life receiving that Abundant Life that
inheritance from Jesus that he's given
you the blessings of God come without
sorrow these are blessings
that you get to enjoy and they stay they
don't leave and they don't come with any
sorrow any troubles but then the people
in the world that don't have Jesus
people believe in a new age people
applying these biblical principles
without knowing they're biblical
they're seeing things happen
for example
um this is just kind of a common sense
simple thing but it's actually a
Biblical principle
when let's say a person in the world is
doing good things and and is nice to
people networking to people and being
nice to people in their career and
Industry and
then those people who are good back to
them and then doors are opened up for
them because they were good they were
kind they were generous to those people
I it seems like common sense but this is
actually a Biblical principle this is
actually the principle of sewing and
reaping the new age World we'll call it
karma but the people in the world that
can do that and really it can work for
them they can get ahead they can have
success doors opening but the difference
is is that those blessings come with
sorrow only the blood of Jesus
protects you and releases Abundant Life
to you over you so you give your life to
Jesus and you step into Abundant Life
and the doors that open for you they're
protected
to stay open and not shut with the the
blessings of God are yours and come with
peace but the people in the world it may
look like they're having so much success
and so much good is happening to them
but these things can really be happening
but on the inside they don't have Jesus
and the inside they have demons and the
inside they're they're being tormented
by the devil and so all of these good
things that are happening it's not even
bringing any kind of peace and joy to
the person they're just
dead and empty inside
or also these blessings these good
things that are happening come with
sorrow meaning they don't last success
comes and then
things are stolen things are taken away
good things happen success happens but
then the Devil comes in another way and
really takes things from someone
so that's the difference that's the
difference you can see these biblical
principles work without Jesus but you're
not going to see blessing you're not
going to see life Abundant Life upon you
so Jesus is the only way he's the only
way it's you're wasting your time
applying these biblical principles
without Jesus so this is a Biblical
principle what you sow you reap in terms
of words you speak and the actions you
take so when you are kind to people you
are sowing kindness and you will reap
kindness back to you when you honor
people when you respect people and it's
not just the immediate that person that
you respect now respects you it is that
that's part of that reaping but it's
more than that it's bigger than that in
the spiritual realm when you are doing
good when you are being kind you're
being generous
and honoring and respectful to everyone
you meet that's gonna come back to you
people that you haven't even met before
will come with respect kindness that you
hadn't done even kindness to them at all
you just met them and this will happen
to you because this is a Biblical
principle
um the words you speak if you're
speaking good if you're speaking life to
people
people will speak good things back to
you and then in your own spiritual life
the actions you're taking the words
you're speaking if you are sinning
opening doors to the devil you are going
to reap destruction this is where it
says whoever sows to please their flesh
from the flesh or destruction
so you are indulging in things you
shouldn't indulge in you are watching
negative dark things you shouldn't be
watching you are putting your eyes Into
Darkness
this is being fed into you you are
sowing Into Darkness
sowing into sin and you're going to reap
Darkness you're going to reap
destruction and what that looks like is
an Open Door to to the demon to Demons
open door to the devil
where demons can come in or if not
demons
unnecessary spiritual attacks upon you
it's as simple as this as the word says
whoever so supplies their flesh from the
flesh will rape destruction
there's consequences to your actions
and then in the same way whoever so as
to please the spirit from the spirit
will reap eternal life when you are
sowing to please God you are obeying him
you are doing what he's asking you to do
you are working for him you're working
with Excellence you're working hard for
him you are reaping protection over you
you are reaping anointing to come in
your life you are reaping God to trust
you and use you in the anointing as he
sees you faithful with what he's called
you to you are reaping
um your spirit coming alive more and
your flesh be pushed down being pushed
down because you're serving God when you
sow to please the spirit in terms of
reading the word you are reaping that
word in your life
you are putting your eyes on the word
you're taking the time to do that you're
sowing into your spiritual health
now the word is is in you it's reap it's
it's like you planted seeds by reading
the word of God and now they're coming
as fruit in you and you are becoming to
be more like Jesus who knows the word so
well and can respond to the devil
quickly when the devil's trying to
attack he he knows the word the word is
him the word becomes you the word
becomes in you
if you're watching this right now you
were sewing to please the spirit and you
are reaping anointing coming in your
life you are reaping your spiritual eyes
opening up and you having more
revelation of God's word you are reaping
more of Holy Spirit energized throughout
your body you're watching this you might
even be feeling more energy and joy
you're sowing into the Spirit by
watching this and you're reaping from
the spirit you're reaping abundant life
eternal life as it says which means
Abundant Life Here and Now and Forever
so when it comes to pleasing God when it
comes to
being loving to people and selfless and
only speaking life to have this
Revelation here of the power of what
you're doing when you're obeying God is
powerful it it helps you
it strengthens you it motivates you to
be so diligent to obey God with
everything
to serve him continually rather than
just going about your day and being like
Oh yeah I need to obey God and so
I need to make sure I only speak life
and did
it's like
wow when I'm obeying God right now I'm
pleasing him number one
number two I am sowing a seed every time
and I'm gonna reap that I'm reaping
becoming more spiritual I'm reaping more
anointing with every action of obedience
towards god with every word of life I
speak with every action of Love of
selflessness shown towards someone else
I'm so in a seat every time and I'm
gonna reap that that's exciting doesn't
that motivate you like make you excited
to
to obey God every single second
to push the flesh down every single
second it's exciting this powerful that
we have this Revelation this kind of
Revelation is what what strengthens you
to serve God to please him it it makes
it more joyful to please God I mean wow
Lord you're so good that
like just serving you is
win-win-win-win-win serving you which is
only benefits me this is for my good
you're so good Lord I want to please you
I want to thank you all right so that
was sewing with your words and your
actions your everyday life and now I'm
going to speak on another area of sewing
and that is
serving God doing the work he's called
you to do doing the hard work
that is challenging sometimes is
uncomfortable sometimes
no one is else no one else has seen but
God this kind of service to God
the consistency the keeping on showing
up and doing what God has called you to
do even when you're not seeing fruit
this kind of serving God
every time you are serving God you are
sowing seeds
every single time received God cannot be
not mocked I mean reap sweaty sows
whoever sows to please their flesh from
the flesh will reap destruction whoever
Sosa plays a spirit from the spirit will
reap eternal life and the last part the
last verse of this is let us not become
weary in doing good for at the proper
time we will reap a harvest if we do not
give up
when you serve God when you're doing
mundane things these ex can you do when
you are serving him in the church just
assisting with the work of God whatever
you're doing behind the scenes in front
of people technical
whatever it is when you are serving God
you are sowing seeds every single time
and you are going to reap a harvest this
truth
is what gave me so much strength and
endurance
in the four and a half years
of serving God
and obeying him serving him when it was
hard and uncomfortable this is what gave
me the strength and endurance right here
is this revelation
that I'm going to reap a harvest someday
um for
about four and a half years
I was sewing so many seeds I was do I
was
doing so many things for God for his
work
from
starting the church when it was just out
of my comfort zone
preparing messages every week and in
2020 every single day during the coveted
times I would go live and preach
to spending
many many hours every day editing videos
that for so many years had hardly any
views
my YouTube channel that now has 300 000
subscribers
had about like around under 50
subscribers
for many years
for many years up until
about two years ago
and
I would just I did I worked so hard I
put so many videos out
I swear I just spent so much time doing
these things and I was seeing
no like
immediate result and even like three
years later I wasn't seeing fruit from
it the social media Pages the YouTube it
was not even growing for those few years
it was just for years just showing up
again and again and again and working
hard and working with excellence
and not seeing any fruit when you sow
into a field when you sow a seed that
seed you don't see it anymore after you
sow it so imagine a big field where you
are you've sown thousands of seeds
you see them all and then you sew them
and when you sew them they're gone I
mean you don't see them at all they're
not gone but you don't see them at all
and then the next day you don't see them
at all in the next week you don't see
them at all the next month you don't see
them at all for a while you see nothing
but those seeds have taken life the
moment you sowed them
and their growing
underneath the ground and one day you're
going to be shocked and surprised and
you're not going to know the time
but one day
thousands at one time
will be sprouting out from the ground
and it will quickly become this gorgeous
flower garden fruit
Orchard just beautiful plants and fruits
and flowers and whatever you planted
but there's a serious time where you
don't see anything
and so that's how it is when you're
serving God when he's called you to do
something it's all about sowing seeds
and not getting like instant
gratification
um like
pay off for your hard work or something
it's just serving God serving God sowing
sowing sowing sewing sewing sewing not
seeing anything but just being
consistent just continuing to be
obedient
with a heart of contentment and a heart
of expectancy and faith knowing that
these are true seeds you've sown they're
there in that ground they haven't
disappeared
God's making them to grow and one day
they are for sure gonna pop out of that
ground what you did
what you did years ago
you will reap a harvest from
and this is a true principle of God
where remember God cannot be mocked not
be deceived this is serious business
serious principle it works
it's true let us not become weary and
doing good for at the proper time we
will reap a harvest if we don't give up
you have to keep someone's seeds and
you're going to see that Harvest come
and so as I said that's what gave me so
much strength as I as I was sewing and
sewing and for years not seeing any
fruit I renewed my mind with the word of
God here
to know that I know I'm going to see a
harvest Someday my work is not in vain
everything I'm doing it's sewing
nothing's wasted I'm gonna see it come
back someday I'm gonna see the fruit of
this someday it adds up all of your hard
work all of your obedience it adds up
and harvest is coming so many times with
God we think we should see it by now we
should see the Harvest by now and we're
like where is it it's coming God's time
means different than yours but believe
me it is coming do not despise these
Small Beginnings for the Lord rejoices
to see the work begin he rejoices to see
the work begin because for there to be
a plant
that's bursting out of the ground and
glorious and beautiful
there has to be a seed
you cannot just get poof a plant
there needs to be the seed and there
needs to be this sohere to sow that seed
and when it comes to the things of God
the things he's called you to
you can't fast forward there you can't
just boom zap become plant
you have to start from the beginning you
have to start in those small beginnings
of sewing it always begins with sewing
and and so many times people think I
remember even with me this survival at
FIFA church and the revivals now events
across the world it it broke out in like
fast in May 2021 and a few months before
may we had
I mean hardly any followers we had very
small following on social media
and
five to ten people coming to church and
just a couple months later after God's
power just started moving mightily in
the first demon manifeston was cast out
thousands and thousands were following
and receiving live online and hundreds
were coming every single week to our
church in the park and videos were going
so viral and word spread so fast
and then I started ministering at
revivalist now events every single week
just a few months later around the
nation and then a few months later
all around the world 10 Nations I
ministered at
in 2022 I remember in the beginning I
would hear some people say like
how I I came out of nowhere and I know a
lot of people kind of think that it was
just like overnight everything happened
and
well first of all Harvest that's how it
is when there's no
there's just flat ground and one day
there's
something sprouting out from the ground
Harvest all the seeds sprout out so yes
Harvest is like an overnight thing but
it doesn't begin with Harvest it doesn't
begin with overnight
there's a beginning and it's long before
and it's unseen that's why it feels like
like for me and other people maybe it
feels like overnight this just happened
but it's only because we've been hidden
they've been hidden all this time
Underground sowing seeds those seeds
have been underground no one saw
people only see the Harvest but not the
Small Beginnings not the sowing for
years and not seen anything
so for me it was
four and a half years
of almost daily
believing in the promises of God and for
those four and a half years seen not
much progress
it looked like in the Physical Realm
um and even many times looking like
going backwards it was four and a half
years of
hard work and sweat and tears
and
hardcore training by the Holy Spirit
including Big Time biblical type tests
the goliaths the Sauls
there was a lot of sowing into the
spirit
a lot a lot a lot of sewing into the
spirit before the reaping of the Harvest
came I want to encourage you if you're
in the beginning phase right now to to
not despite
Small Beginnings
because there has to be a beginning
and it's a the Lord rejoices in that
work because he knows we're on our way
the moment you put that first seed into
the ground you are on your way and if
you are in the middle of your sowing
time do not become weary and doing good
for at the proper time you will reap a
harvest
for me it came when I least expected it
it came
in a shocking surprising way and God is
a God who will do these suddenly type
moments after a time of not suddenly
but you can be expected and excited for
God to surprise you and
show prove to you that he is indeed
faithful
nothing's in vain nothing goes to waste
your whole life is purposeful every day
when you obey God when you serve God it
is Rich with purpose
full of purpose
it's an exciting life to serve God and
it's an exciting life to be a laborer a
sore I declare you to be strengthened to
serve god with excellence and with joy
I break every demonic blockage from you
in every area where the devil's trying
to
steal from you all of the reapings that
you've brought in from a past life that
bondage I break it I speak freedom to
you that you would no longer reap from
sowing into the flesh since you
surrender to God
and Jesus has paid the price for you to
be healed and delivered now in Jesus
name
this is our Fievel Church serving team
getting ready for church yesterday and
as I look at these behind the scenes
videos I'm in awe of the faithfulness of
God it was four and a half years of
believing in the promises of God that
Revival would break out when during
those four and a half years there was
only about five to ten people that would
come to our church every week and I
remember showing up early being the
first one there and I would set up all
the chairs myself sometimes and all of
the giving envelopes and connection
cards I put on these seats that you see
in this picture and I would put out 30
chairs every time even though they were
never even usually halfway filled just
believing in the increase that God would
bring and we would have to pick up the
connection cards and the giving
envelopes that no one ever used because
they didn't fill the chairs and now just
look at this there are 300 shares all
filled I had to order new chairs today
and every seat filled I'm in awe of the
faithfulness of God he is so faithful
[Music]
just looking you see there's Austin on
the sound on the doing the sound he's
serving there's Weston you probably
remember them being delivered so
powerfully they're free now fully free
and serving God and it used to be just
me setting up chairs in the beginning
and then Chantal came and helped and now
we have a whole Revival Army of Warriors
do not despise the day of Small
Beginnings for God loves to see the work
begin just get to the big thing God's
called you to you have to start
somewhere it will be a small beginning
but when you're faithful little God can
give you more can't wait for the next
episode Revival is now
[Music]
your kingdom is
[Music]
Little Rock in your victory
