hi i'm apostle catherine welcome to
another episode of revival is now lately
on this program you've been learning the
power of your words and that it is so
important to only speak life
and never death
not only because this is what is
pleasing to god
but also
whenever you're speaking words of death
it is literally opening up the door to
the devil
where
this weapon formed against you could
turn into a yoke could turn into bondage
today
you will learn
how to be free of those yokes that have
come in because of the words spoken or
other reasons
jesus has come to destroy the works of
the devil jesus has so much compassion
on us he doesn't care what you've done
in your past he just wants you to be
free so he's completely forgiving you of
the careless words you've spoken of the
words of death you've spoken of the
times you've even partnered with the
enemy with your words he's forgiven you
it's it's done
as soon as you turn to him repent and
say lord i'm sorry for what i've said in
the past forgive me i don't want to do
that anymore i only want to speak words
that please you i always want to keep
the doors up to the devil so jesus now
wants you free today you will be free
jesus has returned the authority to you
you now have free will
to choose
god's portion for your life or the
devil's portion for your life the reason
for bondage is because you have using
your free will your authority
and basically in the spiritual realm
said to the devil i accept your portion
i accept bondage you didn't with your
mind say that but with the action of
speaking death with the action of
opening up the door to the devil
with your words it's the action of
saying i accept the bondage
in this revival god is restoring his
power to heal and deliver and he's also
restoring revelation
of how to access that power of how to
see healing and deliverance happen
in the acts church they were seeing
mighty miracles it would say in the acts
church that everybody was healed and
delivered
that reveals to us that not only did
they have the power of god but they had
revelation
of how to see this deliverance and
healing take place on such a massive
scale where everyone was healed so in
this revival god is restoring revelation
of how to see freedom take place so he's
releasing his anointing and he's
releasing revelation of how to
walk in god's power of how to receive
god's power to bring healing and freedom
so one of these revelations is
renouncing to bring about freedom
renouncing means to abandon something
that you once claimed as your own so you
might have claimed the devil's portion
as your own you might have claimed
sickness as your own
the action of accepting a diagnosis the
action of speaking aloud i have this
sickness
that is the action of claiming it
because the bible says by his stripes
you are healed we are called to walk in
authority we are called to recognize
that the devil's a liar and he can bring
the lies in the forms of symptoms and
the forms of pain
these are weapons but they're not real
unless we allow them to be so we're
called to
say
sickness go pain go i reject the
diagnosis i reject every word curse
i am healed by jesus's stripes that's
generally that's an example
of how we are supposed to walk as
children of god who walk in authority so
when you're not doing that
that's the action of
claiming
the devil's portion on the last episode
i shared an example of how
words of death were spoken over this
gentleman he's an adult male now but
when he was a child words of death were
spoken over him from different family
members one family member called him
stupid one family member was mad at him
one time frustrated and he just said
you're going to turn out like your uncle
and his uncle
had passed away from
drugs and alcohol
addiction he confessed these things now
the reason he confessed these things was
because he identified when those words
of death were spoken over him
they affected him
and something changed for the bad since
that day
what happens
when you don't have
revelation that we are in a spiritual
war and the way the devil lies most of
the time is through people through
people's words through people near you
close to you in your life this is the
devil's scheme
to speak his
portion
over you to speak
identities opposite of christ over you
to speak what the devil wants you to
think about yourself
over you so the devil wants you to think
you're stupid the devil wants you to
think that you're going to die early
you're going to be an addict like your
relatives
the devil wants you to believe those
lies because as a man thinks so he is
the bible says as a woman or a man
thinks so he is if you believe this
whatever you believe in becomes your
truth
and it manifests
your belief
that's the power of faith that works in
the good and the bad
so many people are so unaware to the
devil's schemes of how he works
especially young children
and so what happens is the world's way
if people speak things to you and
especially if they speak it multiple
times or other people speak the same
things again and again
the world's way is
to believe that it must be true
you know why would a person say that
over and over again why would tons of
people be saying the same thing over and
on top of that why do i have those
thoughts as well agreeing with those
words oh must be true i must be stupid i
must not be pretty i must not be skinny
enough
i must be awkward i must not have what
it takes
etc
the devil strategically
feeds this
specific words towards a person
in their mind
and giving the same idea to other people
for them to speak it at that person so
that person is flooded with the same lie
again and again and again and again and
without the spiritual knowledge they
will just think oh must be truth this is
the simple answer
of why people believe they were
born
with a sexual attraction to the same sex
and that's just how they are it all came
from lives of the devil usually people
who are battling with homosexual desires
one of two or both
of these things happened one they were
sexually abused as a child many times
and since that day sometimes manifesting
later in life
the
same sex attraction and thoughts came
or number two the person had looks
qualities
and traits that society calls feminine
so
young children at a young age
can seem feminine more feminine to other
people and then
these people can start to speak over
them
you're gay this is who you are this is
who you are and the words are so
powerful so if you don't have the
spiritual knowledge you will just take
whatever the words are that come at you
as your truth and that is the action of
agreeing with the enemies portion for
your life
and that becoming a yoke becoming a
stronghold
so people have demonic yokes of identity
that is not of christ these demonic
yokes going against the identity of
christ come from believing
lies of the devil many times coming
through words
of people and so what happens is the
devil
makes a strategic attack the abuse
happened so he knows exactly where to
attack you he that abuse happens so he's
gonna flood you with unworthiness
thoughts with shame thoughts if someone
was sexually
abused as a child the devil knows
exactly what to do his strategy is to
flood that child with homosexual
thoughts
and
other people in his life to begin
speaking that over him and as they speak
over the person and that person believes
it more and more they evolve into
somebody different they literally change
so it's like the enemy is literally
transforming this person
into what the devil wants him or her to
be if you begin to have these lies
circle in your mind thoughts against
your identity and then other people are
speaking them at you it is very
important you are aware
all these are lies and i reject these
lies these are not truth at all i reject
them
and i'm never going to speak them out
loud i'm never going to agree with them
they are lies these words of death
coming from other people
these at this stage it's weapons formed
against you the bible says the weapons
formed against you weapons may form
against you but they shall not prosper
but that
is speaking of when you actually
walk in your authority in christ submit
to god resist the devil and he will flee
so the devil comes with these weapons
but you have to submit to god and resist
the devil
and then he must flee
that's when those weapons aren't going
to prosper
but weapons have prospered in many
people's lives in the forms of yokes
people not doing anything just letting
the weapons come not doing anything
saying oh
oh i guess this is my portion accepting
devil's will
becomes
yolk's bondage now
there's different ways that demonic
spirits yolks
come in a person
but one of the biggest ways
is by the word
because your word carries life or death
and the word is how you're executing
authority
so you are literally many times
executing your authority in the wrong
ways like we're given free will
when you're agreeing with the devil's
lies
you're using your authority and saying
okay yeah i accept this yep this is my
portion yep this is who i am yep this
identity this false identity that's not
of christ is who i am
oh this is a diagnosis for me okay yep
this is what i have okay we'll go to the
doctor we'll do things the world's the
way but you done nothing spiritually to
stop this spiritual demonic attack
you've accepted it spiritually and now
you're trying to fix things physically
but you have to deal with it spiritually
if you can try to fix things physically
all you want but if you never did
anything about the spiritual
attack the spiritual route it's staying
there
until you take action this is what we're
learning today how to take action now so
most demonic yokes have come by a person
using their authority the wrong way and
allowing the devil's portion to come in
their life agreeing with the devil's
lies speaking it aloud so now you're
going to learn
how to be free
of those demonic yokes so
this revelation that god has released of
renouncing
means to abandon something
you once claimed is your own
so
you once claimed things as your own
you once claimed devil's lies devil's
portion devil's identity
as your own so now you need to because
you're given authority
you need to do something you need to do
an action you need to
abandon what you've claimed as your own
and remember the powers in your words so
for the most part these things come in
through your words accepting them in
some way
now we need to do the reverse we need to
take back
what we spoke you need to use your
authority
and say
i know that i once allowed the devil's
portion in my life but
i'm taking a stand today
as the bible says
stand firm against all strategies of the
devil i'm standing firm today
i'm taking a stand today for once i'm
using my authority in christ
how i'm supposed to
the devil has no power i have power over
the devil so now i'm using my authority
and kicking the devil out kicking those
demons out i'm using my authority and
saying i don't want the devil's will
anymore in my life i don't want his
portion anymore i don't want sickness i
don't want bondage i don't want his lies
i want god's will
so i reject lack sickness oppression
i accept and i declare
abundant life
by his stripes i'm healed
freedom healing abundance in every area
is mine i speak it now this is what i
want that's what renouncing is
to to explain it to summarize it many
believers publicly confess their sins
and disclose their secrets the power of
god caused the word to spread and the
people were greatly impacted right
before this it speaks about how apostle
paul was doing such extraordinary
miracles and everybody was being healed
so then here goes on to say that many
believers publicly confess their sins
and disclose their secrets they were not
just confessing their secrets just to
like get things off their chest just to
like become closer
you know get more intimate as a family
that's not the purpose of why they were
confessing publicly their sins and
disclosing their secrets the reason was
was because this was a key that unlocked
their deliverance
as they were confessing their sins and
disclosing their secrets publicly they
were being set free
renouncing doing what they are doing is
one of the big keys that unlocks
freedom for people who are bound the
reason being is because
you've used your authority in the wrong
way for the most part it doesn't always
happen this way sometimes it's other
people using taking their authority on
you like past generations maybe they
were involved in witchcraft for example
or abuse happened to you as a child that
wasn't you opening the door but
most of the time it does result in
a flood of demonic lies in your head
that you eventually end up speaking
unless the person can receive the
spiritual knowledge immediately the
moment they're abused for example and
can reject all of those lies immediately
so you once spoke
the devil's
portion the devil's will in certain
areas now you need to speak the demons
are hanging on because they have legal
rights because of words you spoke
because of doors you've opened
what makes them to lose their legal
right like lose their grip is when you
renounce
it is two main keys that unlocks freedom
for people anointing which is the power
of god
and
renouncing you need to be a serious
child of god a serious warrior like i'm
ready to take my stand against the devil
to enter in this fight to fight the good
fight of faith
this is the only way you can survive you
cannot be this civilian like lazy wimpy
just like
believer in jesus who does nothing and
just wants people to free you and that's
just it you need to decide i want to
serve god
god is calling me to serve him by being
a warrior by fighting the good fight of
faith by doing what his word says by
resisting the devil by following his
commands taking them so seriously
being so aware in the spiritual realm
careful to not open up doors to the
devil but to follow god's every word and
please him this inheritance that he's
provided for you on the cross that comes
when you give your life to jesus not
just not just say jesus is my lord and
live your life however
that inheritance that jesus has provided
for you that's for children of god
children of god not people who call
themselves christians but real children
of god who are surrendered
so
this inheritance of the freedom is yours
yes freedom's yours but if you're
serious about being a real child of god
it's yours
so right now it's time to be free from
words of death that have
caused you to be in bondage words of
death word curses that have come to you
from other people and also that you've
spoken yourself it's important that you
seek god and ask him lord show me
all these areas that i've spoken death
over myself over my life over other
people
show me areas that people spoke death
over me man i've been having struggles
with my identity for a while
show me lord words that were spoken that
made me think so strongly that it was
the truth remind me lord reveal to me
these things
once you surrender to god seek him in
this way god will start to remind you
reveal things to you
it's important for you to identify
these areas where those words of death
came in where it began
because when you renounce it's important
to not only renounce
the bondage so like i renounce anxiety
ironic suppression i renounce
having desires and thoughts that i don't
want to have not only renouncing that
but also it's important to renounce the
open doors the specific areas where that
demonic oppression came in
this is part of the keys that are
unlocking your freedom that's unlocking
those chains
as you see god he will reveal these
things to you there's different kinds of
words of death that can bring bondage
one of them is people speaking death
over you
and
from now on by the way
whenever anybody speaks any kind of word
of death over to you
go into the spiritual realm immediately
renew your mind with the fact that that
that they spoke is a lie the truth this
is your truth of who you are in christ
go in the word of god where it speaks
about your identity where it speaks who
you are how god sees you
and remind yourself
this is who i am
i am chosen i'm a beloved i'm pure i'm
righteousness i'm clean in god's eyes
speak these things and you can say aloud
i reject those words of death those they
spoke over me and this is my truth this
is who i am
meditate under the word of god and speak
it aloud
and that's how you can have victory and
how those weapons formed against you
will not prosper
if you have children this is very
important any you need to be so serious
now in the spiritual realm with your
kids if your children ever
report to you if somebody called them
something at school perhaps
talk with them and i mean
they can understand things in the
spiritual realm be real with them and
and share like what i'm teaching you
today like that word that someone spoke
that was a lie that was the enemy he
lied it's not the truth and so we're
going to reject that right now this is
who you are this is the truth of who you
are you're beautiful you're smart
you're perfectly made by god you're
loved you're accepted
you're lovable
speak these things over them and then
you can just lead them to even say out
loud i reject
that word curse that was spoken over me
and you can have them speak it aloud
this is who i am in christ the gentleman
in the video that i shared last in last
week's episode that was delivered
he was renouncing
family members speaking over him that he
was stupid and so he renounced that he
says i renounce stupidity i'm not stupid
or announced being called stupid i am
smart
and as he renounced these things demons
were literally saying out of him no no
don't because they knew that was the key
for
him to be free they knew that they were
losing their legal access as soon as as
he renounced these things it's very
powerful it's evidence that this is true
this is real there's such power in
renouncing and renouncing specifically
like not just saying i renounce word
curses but specifically i renounce my
dad calling me stupid like specifically
and he was set free so powerfully
after he renounced those things and he
came back this sunday and testified
how his life is so different after god
freed him
spend time seeking god over the areas of
words of death you've spoken over
yourself even when you were young till
now what are the words that you've
spoken maybe several times too and what
are the things you believed about
yourself that are not of god
and renounce those specifically as god
shows you there's certain word curses
that can be even stronger that you speak
if you are making covenants
covenants are very powerful both in the
kingdom of god and the kingdom of
darkness it's like extra powerful when
you make a covenant rather than just
like speaking a word it's like extra
power it's a promise it's it's like
locking you into something
in an agreement it's like locking you
into an agreement
so there's one big covenant that
many people speak and that's i want to
die or some variation
that's a covenant made with a demon of
suicide or a demon of death so it's very
important that you don't if you struggle
with suicidal thoughts and you've spoken
i want to die it's important that you
not only renounce iran i renounce
suicidal thoughts but that you renounce
specifically the words you spoke
i renounce um saying i want to die when
you do that the covenant's broken
when i've ministered i've seen
many people renounce suicide but the
demons don't go and then i'll ask them
have you said i want to die they said
yes and they renounced that and as soon
as they renounced it they were
immediately set free so
this is really important to renounce
those covenants look back on what kind
of other covenants you could have made
that were demonic that were not of god
were not led by the holy spirit there is
one example of a woman holy spirit led
me to ask her revealed to me
prophetically this key of her freedom
was
some covenant she made and she needed to
pronounce that so i asked her if there
was any covenant she knew of she was
probably in her 30s or so and all of a
sudden it came to her like god just
spoke at her you could tell like this it
was amazing that she even remembered
this it was god um she had made a blood
pact like took blood with another person
and did some sort of
covenant together like they thought it
was innocent children just doing
something but
it was not holy spirit led and
when you are exchanging blood like that
that's not something that god asks us to
do and so even though it can be harmless
and innocent
it's
led by it can be led by the enemy for
some sort of
covenant for an open door for demons to
come in
and so she renounced that and as she
renounced that she was set free
so if you've ever been part of any kind
of cult any
group that was not really led by the
holy spirit even if it was christian
maybe there is like a demonic soul tie
to a christian friend or ex-boyfriend or
ex-girlfriend or group that
looking back you really feel it wasn't
really led
by the holy spirit even if it wasn't
they called themselves christians for
example
and you made promises maybe renounce
those things renounce those demonic soul
ties renounce pacts cove any kind of
covenant that was not led by the holy
spirit another way that demons can come
in is with children they can come in as
voices in their heads and they can not
they can sound not like evil like demons
obviously like obvious demons but they
can come and sound
like loving and so this happens
sometimes where demons are speaking
pretending to be an imaginary friend and
they will get children to make promises
like
promise that you'll let me stay here
forever in your head or something i'll
always be here for you you'll never be
lonely you'll always keep you safe they
could say stuff i've seen this when i
minister people confess this that this
happened when they were a child and they
renounce and they're free so
if that ever happened to you if you had
some sort of imaginary friend voices in
your head that you spoke that you agreed
with
renounce those so as i was speaking i
know god has revealed to you some things
you need to renounce so you can right
now speak these things you can begin to
renounce them not right now renounce
those words that were spoken renounce
those open doors of the devil
i break every word curse off of you i
break every generational curse off of
you now and i detach you from what
you've renounced i'd attach you from all
of those words of death all those
spirits that came in through those words
and on three every demonic spirit
attached to what you've renounced to
those words all must leave in jesus name
one two
three
out now
thank you jesus
i speak complete freedom over you i
declare the identity of christ over you
i declare abundant life is your portion
and i declare now that those
past
thoughts in your mind that would just
speak over you against your identity
that they would just come in your
thoughts they would come in your dreams
i declare them to go forever now i
declare you are a new creation you are
the righteousness of god you are pure
and today is a new beginning in jesus
name
amen i was molested as a
kid twice from two different people
i was confused
coming up and i lived a life even as an
adult
even now struggle
and i want to renounce lust
bisexuality homosexuality
so these are some of the things that
i've been holding for years and years
and years i didn't want to publicly say
that god is freeing you right now and
he's so proud of you
and i detach you from all you have
renounced now
on three every spirit attached every
spirit of infirmity every spirit of
death
every disease every spirit attacking his
identity in christ giving him thoughts
and desires he doesn't want to have all
must go in jesus name
one
two
three
thank you jesus
praise god
