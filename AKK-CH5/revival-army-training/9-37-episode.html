hallelujah so i'm going to teach on fasting today on
0:37
how to fast effectively if you didn't watch my
0:43
message this past sunday at fivefold church revival in the park watch it actually this sunday and the
0:49
sunday before i've been teaching on the spirit of religion
0:55
what it is and how to identify it there is a lot of religion in the body
1:02
of christ uh the bible says that where the spirit of the lord is there is freedom where
1:11
the spirit of the lord can be free when the spirit of the lord is
1:16
is saturated the place saturated the church where there's no
1:22
nothing holding back the spirit of the lord there is freedom there is miracles there
1:29
are miracles there is healing there's deliverance there's life when there is
1:36
the spirit of the lord uninhibited but when religion seeps in
1:44
it literally quenches the holy spirit when you don't see the power of god in a
1:50
church you can know that the spirit of religion is there
1:55
and to be truthful because the the spirit of religion
2:01
has seeped into the church so much so much into the body of christ to be
2:06
truthful man like pretty much most if not all of us have been taught
2:14
at least something that was religious at least something that was
2:20
religious doctrine religious revelation the pharisees knew the word of god
2:26
perfectly they knew that they these guys do the word of god better than anybody
2:31
they could recite the word of god they memorized the word of god they knew it in and out
2:38
but they had the wrong revelation of the word of god they actually had the
2:44
opposite revelation of the word of god because they could not recognize jesus
2:50
who is the word when he came not only could they not recognize jesus
2:55
they crucified him they accused him of going against the word of god when he was the word of god
3:03
they had it the opposite it's the same word of god but they're getting
3:08
completely different revelation of the word of god the religious
3:14
revelation which comes from the enemy the the the aim of the spirit of the
3:19
religion the aim of why the devil wants you to have the spirit of religion is to
3:24
keep you from knowing god's love to keep you in bondage to get you to do what the pharisees did
3:32
blast in the holy spirit and try to kill the move of god and try to get you to go to hell that's
3:39
the aim of the devil with the spirit of religion and the spirit of religion
3:45
is found in the church it's not found in atheists it's found in the church so the same way that the devil brought
3:52
this wrong uh religious revelation of the word of god the same way he did with the
3:58
pharisees he has the same tricks the same schemes today the same
4:04
so listen body of christ all of us we have to humble ourselves
4:10
and just be real to the fact that there is probably some religious doctrine in us
4:20
if jesus were to come here in the flesh today he would do some things that would offend a lot of people
4:29
he would do some things that you wouldn't expect just because
4:34
it is very rare that there's completely religion free
4:39
in us completely religion free because we've heard so many teachings we've been to
4:45
church for so long and we've built upon wrong doctrine sometimes wrong religious
4:51
revelations that we ourselves were saying god told me this but it was actually a spirit of religion speaking
4:56
to you okay so uh we the way that we can be free of the spirit of religion
5:04
completely is to humble yourself that's the way that's the way is to
5:10
humble yourself and to and to be be okay with god confounding you be okay
5:16
with god correcting you be okay with god showing you
5:22
man a lot of things you thought about me were wrong actually god can god can tell you that and you're okay with that a lot of things the way i
5:30
thought church was supposed to be done i had it wrong the way to be a christian i had it wrong
5:37
we got to be okay with that it doesn't matter how long we've been a christian how much of
5:43
the bible we've read how many years we've taught bible school or we've been a pastor we have to have
5:49
the same humility of i could have something wrong so lord search my heart lord search my the wrong
5:56
if there's wrong doctrine in me if i have any kind of religiousness in me
6:02
if there's even one scripture in the word of god that i'm interpreting the wrong way show me god teach me god
6:08
we got to be that way that's the only way god can teach us when you have that heart god will teach you he'll teach you through his word he'll
6:14
send teachers like in this teaching he'll send teachers to you you'll pray this prayer god i humble myself i give
6:21
you permission to confound me to correct me he'll send this teaching to you for example a teaching like this and he'll
6:28
teach you he'll open up your eyes and he'll get the religious gunk out of there hallelujah
6:34
so this topic that i'm teaching on today fasting
6:40
this is one of the principles in the kingdom of god
6:45
that so many of the body of christ has interpreted the wrong way of how to
6:51
fast of what fasting means interpreted the word of god of fasting
6:56
uh with that religious revelation so we're you're gonna learn today
7:02
god's true heart behind fasting how he wants you to fast when he wants you to fast
7:08
what it's supposed to look like and from today you will not be fasting religiously anymore in jesus name
7:15
hallelujah um so
7:20
luke 18 9 luke 18 9 take notes today by the way and just even re-watch this honestly
7:27
because it's it's important and these scriptures are important so take notes um luke 18 9
7:34
to some who are confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else jesus told this parable
7:41
two men went up to the temple to pray one a pharisee and the other a tax collector the pharisees stood by himself
7:48
and prayed god i thank you that i am not like other people robbers evildoers
7:53
adulterers or even like this tax collector fast twice a week and give a tenth of
8:01
all i get this is a pharisee speaking but the tax collector stood at a
8:07
distance he would not even look up to heaven but beat his breast and said god have mercy on me a sinner i tell you
8:14
that this man rather than the other went home justified before god for all those
8:20
who exalt themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted so this passage shows us how you
8:28
can do fasting wrong so wrong that it makes you not be justified by god
8:36
living religiously is a really serious thing because it makes you become like the pharisees
8:43
and go against god to do things religiously to do the things in the word of god religiously
8:48
it's a serious thing so we gotta get it all out we gotta make sure all of our intentions it's never in
8:55
the religious way but it's with a pure heart now god looks at the heart
9:02
jesus came he came and he took the the curse of the
9:07
law upon him on that cross it's by his grace
9:13
that we are saved it's by his grace that you are saved it's not through your works it's not through your fasting it's
9:21
not through your praying that you're saved that was the law and he destroyed it
9:28
now it is by his grace it is by his grace it is by faith that
9:33
we are saved so we simply believe that jesus is lord we
9:39
we speak with words simply jesus you are my lord you are my savior
9:45
and we mean it with our heart and we are saved as long as we
9:50
continually to seek god surrendered you are saved that's it
9:56
it is not like god is looking at your okay did you fast 36 times
10:02
uh per per uh per month you know it is not about doing works no it is
10:11
simply by jesus's grace that we are saved so now god is looking at our heart
10:18
now it is about walking with the holy spirit in surrender
10:24
and following him step by step when he asks you to do this you do it
10:30
when he asks you to do this you do it not
10:36
these are what i need to do fast this amount of times pray this amount of times and then i'm right before god then
10:44
i'm righteous this is what this pharisee was doing he was saying
10:50
oh i'm great and i thank you lord that i'm not like those heathens like those
10:55
sinners i'm great i am righteous before god because because i fast twice a week and
11:04
give a tenth of all i get
11:10
now maybe we are not being like him exactly how we're like looking down upon other
11:16
people saying yes because i fast i'm saved but to be real
11:22
what is your heart though is your heart saying the same thing many people look at fasting as when i do
11:30
this then i know i'm a good christian when i do this then i'm spiritual
11:38
because i fasted for this amount of hours for this amount of days
11:44
i am more spiritual it makes me feel good
11:50
we have to be careful that we're not we're not doing these spirits these beautiful spiritual principles these
11:56
pure spiritual principles we have to be careful they're not doing these pure spiritual principles
12:02
um out of this like making it impure and making it
12:08
about i feel like a good christian now but these are sacred
12:14
these principles fasting this principle fasting this is sacred and to be done only as holy spirit leads
12:23
you not done is something that makes you feel more spiritual makes you feel like
12:30
you sometimes we not out of a bad place but the spirit of religion screams to us um
12:35
you're not a good enough christian hold on instagram is pausing and i'm
12:41
going to take a second to just check up on youtube because i don't think i have gentile watching for me today
12:47
to see if um
12:53
okay i think it's still good on youtube um
12:59
that spirit of religion it speaks to us this lie
13:04
that you're not reading your bible enough that you're not fasting enough and therefore god
13:09
is upset with you god's disappointed you're not a good enough christian that's a lie from the devil
13:14
so we have to really identify that and make sure that we're not doing things because of the spirit of religion
13:21
speaking this oh yeah i haven't read my bible in a while okay i'm gonna make up for it and
13:29
and fast and then i'll feel and i'll feel better there's no relationship with god in that
13:34
there's no relationship there's no heart there of like jesus what do you want jesus how can i touch your heart how can
13:42
i please you what do you want me to do it is that same religious way of that
13:47
pharisee that's like okay i'm good i can feel better about myself because i
13:53
fasted this amount and i prayed this amount of times
13:58
so when first of all when we look at fasting we need to look at look at it as
14:04
this sacred pure pure thing that
14:09
should never be approached with the with this religious mind
14:15
we should never we should really be sensitive to never be doing it out of religion but only as god leads because
14:23
when we do it out of religion number one it's disobedience because god didn't ask you to do it
14:31
number two we're starting to be like that pharisee and and feeling self-righteous
14:38
and number three we're wasting time because god wasn't asking you to do that in that
14:44
moment he's asking you something else and so you're wasting time and you're going farther away from
14:50
where god's called you to be so now i want to to teach
14:57
on really what fasting is now that we know um just to never approach it religiously
15:06
the purpose of fasting number one number one the purpose of fasting is to
15:14
push down your flesh your carnal man
15:21
the parts of you that want the things of the world and to make your spirit man
15:28
that's what came alive when you gave your life to jesus your spirit man is what wants to please
15:35
god and the more that you push down your flesh
15:40
and you build up your spirit man the more you become like jesus and the less
15:47
you become like the worlds the more you build up your spirit man
15:53
the more you think like jesus you desire the things of the spirit you speak like
15:58
jesus and you can be used by god when your spirit man is is built up now
16:04
there's different ways to build up your spirit man uh praying in tongues praying in the
16:11
spirit that's a that's why god wants the gift of tongues the gospel of the holy
16:17
spirit for everyone because it says in the bible that this gift is to edify yourself to edify your spirit
16:25
man god wants everyone to have this tool to edify their spirit man so when you're
16:30
praying in tangsuri
16:35
you are speaking directly to the holy spirit and what you are seeking god's will to
16:42
be done sometimes our prayers are not god's will right so you're seeking god's
16:47
will and in that moment that you're praying in
16:53
the tongues you are when you're doing it with a good heart not out of religion you can bring things
16:59
out of religion too but you're when you're doing it out of a good heart you are being fully spiritual and you're
17:06
literally pushing your your flesh down so that's one of the ways to build up
17:13
your spirit man to make your flesh go down and your spirit man to rise up and
17:18
then obviously reading the word of god not religiously but seeking the holy spirit that's pushing your carnal man
17:25
down and that's feeding your spirit man i'm hearing the word of god faith comes by hearing the word of god coming to
17:32
church like now where god's anointing is really moving and that anointing that
17:37
power of god is feeding your spirit man and it's pushing your flesh down just
17:44
receiving that anointing just receiving that anointed word that's why sometimes
17:50
maybe when you listen like to this life you find your spirit man being energized
17:55
even maybe you start to feel more energy physically because your spirit soul and body and so your spirits come alive now
18:03
your soul is coming more alive and your body's then following hallelujah that's the power of the anointing the anointed
18:10
word of god feeding your spirit man
18:16
worshiping jesus worshiping jesus that's putting your eyes on him and and instead
18:21
of singing a carnal song instead of gossiping or talking about worldly things instead of watching something on
18:27
tv that's worldly you're worshiping jesus you're putting eyes to him that's building up your spirit man and pushing
18:32
your your flesh down spending time with god all of these things build up your spirit man all of these things
18:40
fasting is another one fasting is another way that
18:46
builds up your spirit man and pushes your your flesh down and there all of those all of these that
18:52
i just listed are important so that's why i'm talking about fasting today because this is an important this
18:58
is an important way to push your flesh down and build your spirit man up too hallelujah they're all
19:04
important to do not to be neglected any of them amen so
19:10
the big purpose of fasting one of the big purposes of fasting is to push your flesh down and build up your
19:16
spirit man now many people when they think of fasting
19:21
they think of one thing they think of denying your body food
19:27
which is one of the ways to fast but it is not the only way to fast
19:36
when we're speaking about pushing your flesh down and building your spirit man up
19:42
when we're speaking about fasting to do this the purpose of fasting is to deny
19:47
yourself things of the world that has a hold on your
19:55
flesh that has a hook on your flesh this can be a lot of different things
20:04
this could be that you find yourself you you're just on social media all the
20:09
time you have this habit of being on it for two hours before you get out of bed you have this habit of checking your
20:16
notifications every two minutes you have this habit that you
20:22
have to check it again for hours before you go to bed you have these habits and it's just like
20:28
you go through the emotions and you find yourself like you kind of can't stop doing it it's just this intense habit
20:36
okay anything that is taking that has a hold on your flesh where you
20:41
find yourself like man i feel like a bondage here i feel like
20:48
i can't i almost can't control it like it it it has a hold on me
20:54
that's a plate that's an area where your flesh is too strong and your spirit man
21:00
in that area is is down too low so there are certain things in life where
21:06
fasting is the key to push your carnal man down your flesh down
21:12
and so for example this could be social media this could be tv you could find
21:18
yourself you're like i have to watch just one more episode on netflix and then and then it's the same thing oh i
21:24
just have to watch another one or you have this routine where you have to watch tv before you go to bed or you
21:32
just can't picture a day without it you know or maybe it's you just have to have
21:37
this dessert every time and you feel like so troubled if you weren't to have that
21:43
dessert every single day it could be
21:49
uh overeating too it can be so many different things it
21:54
could be anything that has some sort of hold on you
21:59
god wants us to be free where we live in the world but we're not of it that
22:06
though we're not you know just 24 7 reading the bible praying fasting that's all we do you know
22:12
there's other things we do in life you know we have social media and it's not a bad thing
22:17
you know we have a tv that's not a sin to have a tv you know but that but that
22:24
we have control over our over our flesh that's what god wants
22:31
that our spirit man's leading we're a spirit man is our real self that's what
22:36
jesus made come alive when we gave our lives to him and then we have a soul which is our mind
22:43
will and emotions and then we live in a physical body so god wants your spirit
22:48
man to always be leading to be the one leading where the soul has to follow and
22:54
the body must follow so when you don't feel like doing something the soul doesn't overpower
22:59
the spirit man is so strong that the spirit man takes the lead like if i don't feel going live and preaching it
23:06
doesn't matter my spirit man's like i'm preaching no matter how i feel the bible
23:11
says preach when it's convenient when it's inconvenient and so the soul has no
23:18
no control no i mean it can whine all at once but the spirit you know you can feel all the
23:24
feelings that you have if you don't want to do something but they're so tiny compared to how strong your spirit man
23:31
is that's how god wants you to be that's how he wants you to be
23:37
that's where you can that's where you are being spiritual in that of the flesh that's where you can be pleasing god
23:44
that's where you can be in god's will always that's where we want to be so
23:51
in certain areas you can find that your flesh is stronger
23:57
maybe it's the social media your flesh is stronger maybe you were you're doing great spiritually wise you know but
24:05
there's that one area you're you're just on social media so much and you can't stop
24:12
fast it that's the big purpose of fasting many times is to identify what it is what
24:19
area what area that has a hold over your flesh what
24:25
specific area or areas god wants us to
24:31
walk every day and and and look at ourselves what has a hold over us
24:37
what is that and don't ignore it pay attention to it and do something about
24:42
it by fasting push your flesh down so if you if you notice that if you
24:50
notice it let's say it's social media if you notice that that's this whole of your life if god's convicted you
24:56
then ask holy spirit how long do you want me to fast this for
25:02
and what exactly do you want me to fast don't be religious about it don't do it your own way
25:09
because um it is it is not going gonna be god's will for you to
25:15
uh uh let's say you're receiving so much online and and and you think you should just fast
25:22
everything but god needs you to receive online still
25:28
so don't do it your own way and don't let the devil try to hijack your fasting
25:36
and take away where god's releasing to you so you go farther away no no no make
25:42
sure you're not doing fasting your own way don't do it in a religious way really ask god
25:48
um so if it's your social media for example if you're being convicted on that
25:54
maybe you're receiving from these lives and god's calling you to never miss a live so
25:59
only turn your social media on for when that live's gonna be and then you turn it right off
26:06
maybe god will ask you to do that um but ask holy spirit for how long it should be don't be
26:13
religious about it some people are religious about it and they they say for
26:18
example um it needs to be 40 days don't be religious about it jesus uh
26:25
was fasted for 40 days because he was sent on a specific mission to save the world
26:31
so it's not going to always look like 40 days for you don't just quick jump oh 40 okay i'm
26:38
gonna do 40 days why i say this is because i see many people fasting
26:43
the wrong way fasting religiously like oh i did it for 40 days like jesus did
26:48
oh i'm so spiritual now don't don't do it if don't do it at all
26:54
if that's your your motive to make yourself feel better to make yourself feel more spiritual to try to um
27:02
by your way closer to god by fasting no um
27:08
really be humble and ask holy spirit how long do you want me to fast this for uh
27:14
it could be half a day it could be a full day it could be um
27:19
a week it could be two weeks it'll look different but make sure you're really asking the holy spirit and not just going through
27:26
the religious motions of it
27:35
so that's the big way um a big way to fast which many people don't realize they they just jump quickly to food and they
27:42
but but but maybe some some of you out here you
27:47
you have maybe no food problem like you don't overeat you maybe you're
27:54
actually under eating maybe you're being lazy and not eating enough um or maybe it's like a eating disorder
28:01
type thing and you know fasting wouldn't make sense in that area
28:07
fasting food right um and when you stay focused on religiously like it has to be
28:13
fasting food only then you're missing out on god has you have these other things that the
28:20
flesh has a hold on you in your life social media it can be being social actually um too social uh
28:28
like for me i before i surrendered to god that was an area that my flesh had to
28:34
hold over me was um i never wanted to be alone i wasn't a lonely person but i like never wanted to
28:40
be alone i just preferred too much to always be around people
28:46
it just made me feel like happier and i felt like i was having more fun and i also felt like noticed and you know like
28:54
people saw me and everything and so whenever there was an invitation to hang out with people to do something social i
29:00
said yes always i never said no i never was like um i haven't read the word of god in a
29:06
while i haven't spent like quiet time with god in a while i need to just stay in tonight i'm good no i never did that
29:12
until i surrendered to god until i surrendered to god and then those desires just fell away when i was
29:17
baptized the holy spirit i surrendered to god and i was receiving anointing for the first time and those desires just
29:23
fell away but i specifically started saying no to um hanging out with friends um just when
29:30
i would get those invitations all the time and i would stay home and be with god and read my bible and and spend time
29:35
with him so it can literally be anything whatever you find that you're just like yes i have to do this you can never say
29:41
no you don't have control over it that's what god will be leading you asking you
29:46
to fast and when you when you fast it literally pushes your flesh down so
29:54
before when the flesh was having too much control now it's being pushed down
30:00
where now you can have control now i want to share something right now too about um deliverance
30:07
there are different cases where you can be you can
30:12
the flesh can have a hold over you would say social media it can have a hold over you
30:19
but you might doesn't mean you have a demon it's just that your flesh is so strong
30:25
it could mean you have a demon though you could have a literal spirit of addiction and that's when um you may fast but
30:34
it's helping a little bit but it's still there and you need the anointing to destroy
30:40
the yoke the bible says the anointing destroys the yoke god puts anointing in
30:45
vessels and when you're in the place where anointing is that anointing comes and breaks the yolk
30:53
destroys the yoke casts out the demon cast out the demon of addiction
31:00
so if that that could be you where you have let's say a demon of addiction and also
31:06
your your flesh is strong in that area
31:11
so when you get delivered when you're at a place where anointing is and you get delivered it's so important that you're
31:18
pushing that flesh down your flesh is still the same place although if you
31:24
keep being where anointing is there's this ease that comes with the anointing where thing
31:30
it just naturally like makes your flesh go down when you're staying where the anointing is when you're receiving the
31:37
word of god when you're serving god when you're serving him in the church if you're able
31:42
to uh i noticed that for myself when i started walking in anointing
31:48
i just started to have more natural desires of the spirit and the fleshly desires just fell away
31:56
so being where the anointing is very important um so that as part of the part of what's pushing
32:03
your flesh down a big part of what's pushing your flesh down so that combined with fasting when
32:09
god leads you to combined with receiving deliverance if that's what you need
32:14
this is all what makes your spirit man to rise up and the flesh to go down completely
32:20
so let's say you need deliverance you receive deliverance you're where the anointing is you receive deliverance of
32:25
addiction but your carnal nature is still might still be like you like for social
32:31
media maybe you had a actual spirit of addiction with social media and you were set free and but you you still have those habits
32:38
like to do the same routines with your social media so once you're delivered
32:44
you need to decide immediately to fast or i mean to to literally not do what you're doing with social media to okay
32:51
i'm free now i'm not going back to that and then walk with jesus
32:57
exactly how he wants you to omit that it could be omitting it completely for a time
33:04
uh or it could be just walking with him okay lord i know i'm free now but
33:09
i don't want to open the door so lead me of how i can be with moderation with social media
33:18
so there's that case where you you you're you do need deliverance but then
33:23
there's also a case where you don't have a demon but your flesh is just being stronger
33:29
and you need to fast to push that flesh down and also to make sure that you're
33:35
not opening continually opening the door to get a demon
33:42
so this is the big way to fast is to identify where your flesh is strong
33:50
and where you need to omit something to make the flesh be pushed down that's the
33:55
that's the big that's the biggest way of fasting the second part of fasting
34:02
is to fast for breakthrough
34:09
this one is actually not as common and this one is to always be done as the holy spirit
34:17
leads only as he leads not like i need something i'm gonna fast
34:24
not done as something religiously because it is not fasting that releases
34:29
miracles it is not fasting it is not fasting that releases rewards from god blessings from
34:36
god it is seeking the lord those who seek the lord he rewards those
34:43
who diligently seek him it says in the bible he rewards those who diligently
34:49
seek them not he rewards those who who fast a certain amount of times
34:56
so um there there could be times when god leads you to fast for some sort of
35:03
breakthrough we see this
35:10
we see this in acts 13 verse 1 it says now in the church at antioch there were prophets who spoke a new
35:16
message of god by the way this is new testament prophets look it's right there in the book of acts many people don't
35:23
read their bibles they think there's no more prophets today it's right there in our bibles and apostles are in the new
35:31
testament church in the acts church so in the church of antioch there were prophets and teachers barnabas simeon
35:39
it was called niger lucius of cyrene manan who had been brought up with herod antipas the character and saul while
35:46
they were serving the lord and fasting the holy spirit said set apart for me barnabas and saul
35:53
for the paul for the work to which i have called them then after fasting and praying
35:59
they laid their hands on them in approval and dedication and sent them away on their first
36:06
journey so that is an example where we see fasting for
36:12
breakthrough this should be done just as holy spirit leads and not to be done as a religious thing i need something okay
36:19
i'm gonna fast and then god's gonna give it to me that's where it's religious and dangerous when you're in
36:25
that mindset i want something from god so i'm gonna fast no
36:30
that's dangerous in the spiritual realm that's getting very religious um we don't fast to get something from
36:37
god we fast when he asks us to and when he asks us to
36:42
only not because it's the trend to do not because it's january so religiously
36:48
now that's what a lot of people do so i guess i'll do it too you know no not because oh i want to
36:55
feel and look spiritual i do it for this amount of days i didn't eat all these things look at me no
37:01
only when the holy spirit leads you to so this type of fasting was the fasting
37:07
of food was was denying your body food
37:12
uh in this passage right here the acts 13. so so sometimes god can lead you to
37:17
deny yourself food for the purpose of breakthrough um if there is a lot of demonic bondage
37:24
in your life if it's intense it is a good idea many times with the leaning of the holy
37:30
spirit too fast um especially if you if you know you're going to a place where
37:35
the anointing is where you're going to be set free sometimes especially when the bondage is so deep
37:42
the holy spirit will lead you too fast as it is it is making the demons hold
37:48
uh not as strong not as strong so that they can't be as difficult
37:54
to leave um because you have done your part uh to push down your your carnal man
38:03
so just walk with the holy spirit with that walk with the holy spirit with that and then you can and when you fast food when
38:10
god is asking you to fast food uh
38:15
again don't do it religiously just as holy spirit leads you it could be even just half a day just
38:21
breakfast sometimes he can just ask you to do that just walk with him and don't don't try
38:28
to um try to like kill yourself you know don't try to
38:35
kill yourself because you think you're being so spiritual walk with the holy spirit be sensitive
38:42
to the holy spirit because sometimes where god's not asking us to fast but we're fasting
38:49
out of our own will and there's no grace there because god
38:55
didn't actually ask you to do that so instead your your body's becoming weak and you're starving you're unable to do
39:02
effectively what god's asked you to do because there's not grace there when you're doing it religiously this is why
39:07
i say it's so important to make sure we're never doing it religiously never go into the motions never following a
39:13
like fast trend we're not following a trend we're not trying to compete with other people oh this person said they
39:19
fasted so much so uh i better do that too follow the holy spirit's lead completely
39:26
hallelujah
39:33
matthew 17 verse 14.
39:38
so in this passage right here is
39:45
this story where the disciples were unable to cast out a demon
39:52
and this guy it says a man came up to jesus kneeling before
39:57
him and saying lord have mercy on my son for he is a lunatic and suffers terribly for he often falls
40:04
into the fire and often into the water and i brought him to your disciples and they were not able to heal him they
40:09
weren't able to deliver him and jesus answered you unbelieving and perverted generation how long shall i be
40:15
with you how long shall i put up with you bring him here to me jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him and the
40:23
boy was healed at once then the disciples came to jesus privately and asked why
40:29
could we not drive it out he answered because of your little faith your lack
40:35
of trust and confidence in the power of god for i assure you and most solemnly say
40:40
to you if you have faith the size of a mustard seed you will say to this mountain move from here to there and it
40:47
will move and nothing will be impossible for you but this kind of demon does not go out
40:54
except by prayer and fasting
41:00
this type of demon does not go out except by prayer and fasting
41:05
many people do not know really what prayer and fasting is
41:12
many people have the religious revelation of what prayer and fasting is
41:18
and so many people misinterpret this scripture completely let me tell you
41:24
what so many people ask me man you must fast so much because they see
41:31
you know so many demons going and and principalities leaving glory to god
41:38
so many people like say this like how much do you fast how much do you fast so many people will ask me like how much do
41:43
you fast like they want to know they want to know the formula
41:48
once again it is not you fast this amount of times and that's what makes the demons go
41:56
it is not our religious activities that make demons to
42:03
go what makes demons to go is the anointing and authority that one
42:11
carries and that god chooses to put in a vessel
42:18
that's what makes them leave so why did jesus say
42:23
this kind of demon does not go out except by prayer and fasting because
42:29
really what he's meaning here is that the disciples
42:35
were being too much in the flesh
42:41
prayer number one jesus is not meaning the religious kind of prayer but he's meaning
42:48
what prayer means communion with god prayer is communion with god true communion from your heart
42:56
not religious prayers that have no they're empty empty words
43:02
but a life a life of walking with the holy spirit
43:09
of living with the holy spirit of seeking the holy spirit throughout your days
43:15
of wanting to always please him what do you want me to do holy spirit
43:20
wanting to always be in his will constantly surrendering that's prayer
43:27
that's communion with god so that's what he's meaning by prayer
43:32
and fasting he's meaning what i share what i just shared with you
43:39
of what fasting is to deny your flesh and build up your spirit man
43:46
so there was areas in the disciples lives where their flesh was too much was
43:51
too high and they weren't serious enough they weren't at least at jesus's level
43:59
they were serious enough to push the flesh down to deny the flesh where it was too
44:05
strong and become more spiritual see what makes god to entrust you with
44:12
anointing is when he sees you he looks at your heart he tests you he
44:21
tests your heart so over day after day week after week
44:26
year after year god gets to know your heart god watches you
44:32
he watches your obedience he watches when you when your flesh is too high what are you doing
44:39
he's watching can he entrust you with this anointing he's watching are you becoming more
44:45
spiritual he entrusts the anointing with this when you are spiritual when you are like
44:52
jesus so he's watching are you becoming like jesus
44:58
are you obeying him in every area are you obeying him when he asks you to push
45:03
your flesh down are are you obeying him when you don't feel like doing the work of god but you
45:08
do it anyways with a smile on your face and with no complaints he's listening to the words you speak
45:18
so when he sees he can entrust you with anointing by taking you through tests
45:25
by looking at your heart every day then he can release the anointing to you
45:34
because you've become so spiritual he can entrust you with the anointing that
45:40
makes the high-level demons to go so it is the anointing that destroys the
45:45
yoke it says in ephesians ephesians 6 how we are not in a war
45:51
against flesh and blood but against principalities against rulers
45:57
against spiritual forces these are speaking of different
46:02
levels in the demonic realm they carry different levels of power principalities have this have the high level power
46:10
there are different levels so that's why the the the disciples were able to cast out
46:15
other demons but they weren't able to cast out the highest higher level demons that
46:21
jesus was able to because they didn't yet have this greater higher anointing
46:28
that jesus carried that could cast out the principalities
46:34
for god to release the higher level anointing god needed to see that they were serious
46:41
that they were becoming more spiritual that they were pushing their flesh down
46:50
that's the real meaning of it and we can see this clearly people many
46:56
times sometimes take that that passage that scripture this kind of demon does not go out except by prayer
47:02
and fasting they take it literally how they think they they take it like literally in the
47:07
fact of like they think in their mind i tried to cast out this demon it didn't work so
47:15
um i'm gonna go fast for one week and then meet me back at the church or meet me
47:21
back here and then i'm gonna try to cast out that demon because now i have fasted
47:27
many people think that that's like what the scripture means but um we don't see jesus
47:34
when the guy brought the demon-possessed guy to jesus
47:39
we do not see jesus say wait this only goes out by fasting so
47:45
therefore do you have to stay right here i'm gonna go fast for a week and then i'm gonna come back and try to
47:51
cast out that demon out of out of your son we don't see jesus doing that
47:57
jesus was already prepared jesus already had the anointing
48:03
so uh he immediately cast the demon out right there right there immediately
48:09
so um that is really the meaning of that scripture is that jesus is talking about
48:15
you need to be more spiritual you need to be less of your flesh
48:21
and you need to take it more seriously following me serving me being used in my anointing
48:28
that's that's what jesus is meaning there hallelujah
48:36
john 21 verse 15. so
48:42
jesus after he was resurrected he returned back to the he appeared to the disciples
48:48
and peter you know jesus had commissioned him
48:54
he had commissioned him and it's like peter forgot peter
49:01
peter forgot i mean he just goes back to fishing he goes back to his fishing business
49:08
and this was a moment where his flesh was greater it's like his flesh was winning
49:14
in that moment to neglect what jesus had asked him to do and trained him to do and commanded him to do and he just went
49:20
back to the easier way the more comfortable way the thing he knew fishing so jesus comes back
49:26
and he says to peter simon son of john do you love me more than these
49:31
he's talking about then fishing yes lord he says you know that i love you jesus says feed my lambs
49:40
again jesus said simon son of john do you love me he answered yes lord you know that i love you jesus said take
49:47
care of my sheep the third time he said to him simon said of john do you love me peter was hurt because jesus asked him
49:53
the third time do you love me he said lord you know all things you know that i love you jesus said feed my sheep
50:00
so this was a moment where jesus was saying to peter peter right now
50:06
like you're not demonstrating that you love me more than what your flesh wants you to do do you love me are you willing
50:14
to deny your flesh are you willing to just to deny what's comfortable for you what gives you
50:20
gratification what gives you satisfaction are you willing to deny yourself
50:26
to follow me because you love me
50:33
and that's that's why we fast is because we love jesus that needs to
50:40
be the motive not to be a good christian not to look spiritual not to make ourselves feel better and
50:46
feel more spiritual but our motive with fasting needs to always be because we love jesus
50:52
because we want to please him because we want to become more like him because we want to be used by him with
51:00
powerful anointing that's your call on this earth this is your purpose
51:06
to carry the anointing the power of god
51:11
jesus in his fullness to release him to this world and to set
51:17
people free and heal people and lead people to jesus to be saved this is
51:23
why you're here so that should always be your motive with fasting and whenever you're going
51:30
throughout your life throughout your days and you're just noticing things
51:35
where your flesh has a hold on you come with that heart don't condemn
51:41
yourself don't listen to the spirit of religion
51:47
come with a heart that wants to just please god
51:52
come with an obedient heart open and willing to do whatever god is asking you
51:59
whatever he wants you to fast for however long for however short
52:04
that you just want to be in his will and you just want to be more like him
52:10
amen hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus
52:17
thank you jesus thank you jesus so
52:23
now you know how to fast effectively now you know how to fast in a way that will please god
52:30
and will really make you become more spiritual instead of being stuck in religion you will truly become more
52:37
spiritual more like jesus and free hallelujah
