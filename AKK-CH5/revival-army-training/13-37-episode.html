the past couple weeks the last two Sundays I've been teaching a series
0:06
uh freedom from the spirit of religion and so if you have not seen either of
0:14
those messages it's so important you listen to them after this Sunday go back
0:19
and listen to them they're on my YouTube on five full Church YouTube you can find them there under the live and also
0:27
um the Sunday before the Sunday or last Sunday it's um edited under video
0:33
section so make sure you go watch those catch up it's so important you have this
0:38
Foundation of what the spirit of religion is I'm teaching I've been teaching in depth on what this spirit is
0:44
because a lot of people do not have Revelation don't don't really know what it is they just hear about it religion
0:49
religion Spirit of religion but they don't know what it is so my people perish because a lack of knowledge when
0:55
you don't have knowledge of this spirit and how it's trying to influence you and how maybe it even
1:00
isn't you you can't be free from it but when you know the truth you will be set free the Bible says so that's why
1:07
we've been going so deeply into understanding what this spirit is so you can discern it and so you can get it out
1:14
of your life and stop it from coming trying to influence you amen
1:20
so Hallelujah today is going to be specifically a the message is is called
1:28
religion free ministry [Applause]
1:36
um meaning today you are going to learn how to minister to others void of religion
1:44
free of religion having no religiousness in any kind of spirit of religion in you as you're ministering to people this is
1:51
so important so important amen
1:57
you were all called to be ministers you are all called to be vessels of God to minister to others
2:04
in in different kinds of capacities you're not all called to be a faithful Minister you're not all called to be you
2:10
know preaching on a stage and having a church or an itinerary speaker or something that's not all of your
2:15
callings but you're all called to minister to people throughout your days to minister to those who need Jesus who
2:23
are lost who are sick who are oppressed it's a great commission for all of us to
2:29
Proclaim that the kingdom of God is a hand to heal the sick to cast out demons to raise the dead amen
2:35
so you must be the whole body must be equipped on this how to minister the
2:41
right way the Jesus way which is void of religion
2:46
Hallelujah John 12 46.
2:52
Jesus says I have come as a light to shine in this
2:58
Dark World so that all who put their trust in me will no longer remain in the dark
3:07
I will not judge those who hear me but don't obey me for I have come to save
3:13
the world and not to judge it but all who reject me and my message
3:19
will be judged on the day of judgment by the truth I have spoken
3:26
so even Jesus he's saying even if you don't receive me and believe me I won't
3:32
judge you there will be a day of judgment though but I won't judge you here and now I
3:39
have come to be the light I have come to bring love to you
3:45
Hallelujah when we see Jesus ministering throughout the gospels Jesus is always coming
3:54
to people to speak to them to minister to them with love
3:59
with compassion with Grace with Mercy
4:05
every time this is how it is I'm going to give you a couple examples of what him ministering to others what
4:12
it looked like John 4 verse 15.
4:18
there's a Samaritan woman at the well and Jesus comes to her she had had many
4:25
men um many husbands and
4:32
um Jesus saw this prophetically so we'll read this verse 15. please sir
4:39
the woman said give me this water then I'll never be thirsty again and I won't have to come here to get water go and
4:46
get your husband Jesus told her I don't have a husband the woman replied Jesus said you're right you don't have a
4:52
husband you have had five husbands and you aren't even married to the man you're living with now
4:57
you certainly spoke the truth the woman said I know the Messiah is coming the one who is called Christ when he comes
5:04
he will explain everything to us this is fast forwarding to verse 25 then
5:09
Jesus told her I am the Messiah so what we skipped was that Jesus he says You
5:15
must be a prophet to know these things and then it goes on to say verse 25. I know the Messiah is coming and Jesus
5:21
says I am the Messiah so she didn't have husbands she used to have husbands is what I meant to say
5:26
um and so Jesus uh just encountered her with so much love
5:31
you can you know right after this passage the Bible says that she goes and
5:36
tells everyone she knows about Jesus about the fact that the Messiah is here and
5:43
she's so excited and full of passion that you can tell that she was really
5:49
touched By God's love she was really excited
5:54
she was changed forever I mean you have to realize this from the
6:00
scripture because it's not like today I mean today if you were like this woman
6:05
and you have had many men in the past and you're living with one you're not married to that's not maybe such a big
6:11
deal it's looked probably looked down upon by Christians of course but back
6:16
then that was so scandalous I mean you were just looked so down upon it was so
6:23
embarrassing you wouldn't want people to know that about you you knew they would immediately judge you and treat you bad
6:29
but Jesus knows this about her and her reaction the fact that she is just full
6:36
of so much joy and so much joy that she just goes and tells everyone she knows about Jesus
6:41
this shows us what this interaction really was like because you need
6:47
Revelation you can just read this and you can read it different ways you could read Jesus saying it like this way
6:54
you're right you don't have a husband you have had five husbands
7:02
and you aren't even married to the man you're living with now
7:07
I'm so disappointed in you Within
7:16
the religious revelation rather than the Revelation coming from the Holy Spirit
7:23
but you when you know God's heart you can read that accurately you can get
7:29
this Revelation come to these conclusions by reading and seeing how she's just so full of joy and life
7:37
this must mean that's so much love and compassion and mercy and Grace was
7:44
pouring out of Jesus not judgment
7:51
this must mean this right so this is really how how we should read
7:57
it you're right you don't have a husband for you've had five husbands and you
8:03
aren't even married to the man you're living with now um like so he's speaking this matter of
8:10
factly but imagine Jesus speaking in his eyes just full of so much love and
8:16
compassion love just exuding love love coming out saying I know I know your life I know
8:24
what you've been through I know and I'm not judging you for any of it I love you
8:31
I know everything and I love you I don't judge you I love you
8:37
this was what was coming out of his eyes this is what was coming out of his voice when he interacted with her
8:44
so this was Ministry that was taking place this was prophetic Ministry that was taking place
8:49
and the result was I mean she she was saved she gave her life to Jesus she was surrendered she
8:56
immediately became a a evangelizing she immediately wanted to tell others
9:03
about this great love Jesus who she'd encountered and then when she when she met people
9:09
she God was already moving through her I just encountered the Messiah I want
9:16
you to meet him too he's full of so much love come you don't want to miss this he's so
9:22
amazed that's that's how it was okay she was
9:29
not like this oh the Messiah is here but be prepared he knows everything
9:36
about you so you might want to walk slowly because it's gonna be awkward and you're going to be judged
9:46
but she didn't do that right it was the other way which shows us how Jesus ministered to her with so much love and
9:53
not judgment he was so attracting
9:59
[Applause] here's another example of Jesus ministering John 8 verse 7.
10:07
so there's a woman who was who was committing adultery you know this story
10:13
she was committing adultery and there were these Pharisees that wanted to do what the law said to do which is to
10:19
Stone her to punish her for doing this horrible crime much worse in those days than today this was so bad
10:26
so evil to do this to commit adultery and so the law said that she should be stoned but then Jesus is coming in this
10:33
new way of compassion of grace of love and not judgment amen
10:39
but these Pharisees these Pharisees that have the Spear of religion they are
10:44
demanding an answer from Jesus like they want to Stone him Stone her and so
10:50
they're saying Jesus we want to Stone her so it says they kept demanding an answer so Jesus stood up and said all
10:56
right but let the one who has never sinned through the first stone then he stooped down again and wrote in the dust
11:02
when the accusers heard this they slipped away one by one beginning beginning with the oldest until only
11:09
Jesus was left in the middle of the crowd with a woman then Jesus stood up again and said to the woman
11:14
where are your accusers didn't even one of them condemn you
11:20
know Lord she said and Jesus said neither do I go and sin no more
11:26
and I and I and I picture Jesus with the Revelation the holy spirit gives me I picture Jesus standing
11:34
just as this protector of his daughter
11:40
protecting her from being judged and stoned just full of so much love this
11:45
protection coming from so much love and saying none of you will be able to Stone her
11:53
she will not receive judgment I'm protecting her by my love and then I see Jesus I see Jesus
12:00
speaking to her like this eyes full of love gentleness compassion
12:07
where are your accusers didn't even one of them condemn you
12:14
like speaking like so happy that there is Victory and and so happy that she can
12:21
see his love for her
12:26
no Lord she said and Jesus said neither do I
12:32
Full Of Love full of grace void of judgment
12:37
go and sin no more now once again the religious Revelation
12:45
the spirit of religion could read this scripture differently it could picture Jesus speaking like this
12:51
now you better go and sin no more I'm only coming this one time
13:00
to rescue you what are you doing sinning you need to
13:05
stop it you need to go and sin no more
13:11
full of judgment but the real revelation of the holy
13:17
spirit is going to know more my child's
13:22
now that you have encountered my love
13:28
you're no longer a slave to sin
13:35
you know that's what gives you the ability to live purely and righteously and
13:41
surrender to God is when you encounter God's love the Bible says that the kindness of God
13:48
leads to repentance it does not say the judgment and wrath of God leads to
13:56
repentance the kindness of God leads to repentance so this means
14:02
the love the kindness the grace the mercy the compassion
14:09
of God leads a person to repentance so what this means is that without it
14:16
people can't repent I am determined that a person cannot
14:22
fully surrender to God until they have really met him encountered his love
14:30
you cannot force surrender and that's what we've been learning about the past couple weeks about the
14:36
spirit of religion people they don't know God's love and
14:41
they're just trying to do the right things but when you don't know God's love you don't you do not have the power
14:50
to live pure and righteously but when you can simply encounter God's
14:57
love your eyes open up to his love for you you fall in love with him
15:02
and when you fall in love with him you you want to give your life to him it's easy for you it's the only thing
15:10
that makes sense that's what happened for me when I encountered God's power and my eyes open up to his love for me
15:17
I surrendered to God right then and there immediately no um altar call no nobody leading me
15:25
through a prayer but I had this desperation in me I must
15:30
give my life to him like how marriage is you want to
15:36
serve your spouse please your spouse you want to see them have joy that's what
15:42
brings you the most joy for a spouse or maybe someone who you love the most in this world
15:48
if they're sad that makes you more sad then like you personally getting sad of
15:54
something else in your life right when you love someone that much it pains you right
15:59
and So you you're you're living like to serve to serve them
16:05
to see their heart be touched that's how it is with God when you really love him and and you can't really love him until
16:11
you meet him but you meet him you encounter him and now you want to please him you want to
16:17
touch his heart it's it's not hard it's easy to be surrendered when you can actually meet Jesus
16:24
because your heart really wants it it becomes your greatest desire all the desires of the world Fall Away
16:31
amen so so this is what people need they need
16:37
encounters with God which is his love they need to meet him
16:42
and know his love find out how much he really loves them which cannot come with
16:48
words but only his power Paul says I didn't come to you with wise
16:53
and persuasive words but with a demonstration of the power of God so that your faith will not rest on man's
16:59
persuasive words wise words but on God's power meaning if you just talk about God
17:06
people aren't going to encounter him and meet him and fall in love with him they're not going to know his love they're going to hear about his love but they're not going to know his love
17:13
but if you can be a vessel of God's power and love and love people and be a true vessel of
17:19
him where his love is really coming through and his power is coming through then they will actually meet him and
17:24
fall in love with him and surrender from their own heart they
17:31
will in their own heart want to please God amen Hallelujah
17:37
Hallelujah so what happens is I mean this is what happened for me
17:43
I struggled with surrender until I encountered God in power like I didn't know what was wrong with me I would go
17:50
to church service after church service I would hear a similar message but these churches I was going to had no power of
17:56
God and I wasn't seeing transformation in me and I was stuck and I had the spirit of religion and
18:03
I heard condemnation from God and I didn't know why I couldn't surrender I wanted to surrender I really wanted that
18:08
but I didn't know why one foot was stuck in the world and then one encounter with God's power
18:14
and when my eyes opened up in that moment to his love for me as a result of encountering his power
18:19
it was my biggest desire and passion to please him to be surrendered to him and it's been the same since that day it's
18:26
I've never gone back it's been since that day my greatest desire has been to please him
18:31
foreign Hallelujah
18:37
but before you encounter his love it's not possible you will keep on sinning
18:45
so what's happening here is she met Jesus encountered his amazing love she
18:53
became saved she really at this point would want to surrender because she actually encountered him
18:59
and met him and so now she's able to no longer sin
19:05
so I I see Jesus as saying now now that you've now that you know my love and
19:11
you've fallen in love with me and you want to surrender to me now go
19:16
and sin no more now you're able to go and sin no more now you're no longer a slave to sin now
19:25
you know who you are as a child of God now go and sin no more my child
19:32
not go and sin no more you sinner
19:38
no it's so different you see how different it is
19:43
but the spirit of religion views it that way
19:51
[Music] that way
19:57
Jesus is so loving and Grace and full of grace and mercy and compassion that's who he is
20:04
and this is who people I mean when people meet us this is how
20:11
they meet Jesus that's God's biggest way of
20:16
of touching his people is through us it's just God's way it's just God's way most of the time
20:23
he's not appearing in physical form and speaking audibly to people for most people the way that they will
20:30
encounter God the in the biggest ways the most ways is through people
20:35
so children of God do we have a big responsibility or what a big
20:41
responsibility to represent God rightly when you read in the gospels one of the
20:48
big things that Jesus is doing in the gospels is being an example for us of
20:53
how we should minister to others of how we should speak to them of how we
20:58
should pray for them of how we should treat them of how the tone of our voice should be which is why you need the right revelation of the Holy Spirit
21:05
that's the big thing he's doing is he's teaching us he says you will do the things I did and greater
21:12
you will be ministering as I did we have to be like him
21:20
and the spirit of religion is so far from who Jesus is
21:25
Christians that operate in the spirit of religion with this judgment
21:32
with this fear that is not Jesus that is the opposite
21:38
of Jesus there is no condemnation in Christ Jesus the first verse we read says that Jesus
21:45
isn't even judging people
21:51
you know he says this you'll have Judgment Day the father will judge you at judgment day but right now I'm not
21:56
judging you I'm here to show you my love and give you free will and not try to
22:02
manipulate you with fear and condemnation and judge judgment
22:08
and that's what the spirit of religion does in the church it is so prevalent
22:17
for Christians to be ministering to others with the spirit of religion
22:27
it it is probably more it's this is really sad but it is it's the truth it is probably
22:34
more common to see people in the body of Christ ministering with a spirit of religion
22:40
than really representing God rightly it is more prevalent
22:46
just like it is more prevalent to see dry churches void of the Holy Spirit and the
22:52
anointing in the same way it translates Okay so
22:58
we've been learning the past couple of weeks about the spirit of religion and how people live in it in their own life
23:04
and how number one they think that performance
23:10
is what brings righteousness and number two they bring they they have
23:16
judgment they think God's condemning them so they're living thinking that God's
23:21
condemning them all the time so they're living thinking that God is always judging them
23:27
so therefore then they represent God the wrong way they they think they don't know who God
23:34
really is and so it's happening to themselves they're condemning themselves and they're performing themselves and then
23:40
they go out and they perform more and they tell others they need to perform
23:45
to have their righteousness in a matter of words but how they're speaking they're communicating if you
23:52
want to be saved if you want to have righteousness you need to perform you need to do this this and this you
23:58
need to stop sinning and do this this this this and they they speak with so much
24:06
judgment towards other people when they're when they're ministering
24:12
when they're evangelizing they're speaking in a judgmental tone
24:18
so they're living in the spirit of religion they don't know who really God is they think he's judgment they think
24:23
he they need to perform they don't know Grace and then that comes out of them to other people
24:30
this is I I said last week that the spirit of religion is the most poisonous
24:37
spirit and thing in the body of Christ I mean in the spiritual realm I mean
24:43
um number one for your own spiritual health because it's keeping you far from God
24:50
and keeping you from even salvation because you're not even entering his grace and we have to enter his grace to
24:56
be saved amen but number two it's the most poisonous because
25:03
it's harming other people you have the responsibility to represent
25:08
Christ and you're representing him wrong so I see I see this very prevalent today
25:16
in the body of Christ I see Christians that that they think
25:23
they need to go out and evangelize to everyone in a religious way
25:30
and they think that they need to go and warn people and tell people the end is
25:36
near do you know where you're going to go hell is a real place
25:43
come to Jesus or you're going to go to hell
25:49
you need to stop sinning and you need to come to Jesus
25:54
and then they they recite verses in a but but not with the love of God for
26:01
Jesus is the way in the truth and the life and they they know so much scripture
26:07
just like the Pharisees they know so much scripture and they speak it and they sound like the they can sound to people like these amazing evangelists
26:14
but they're carrying no spirit of God and they're like Pharisees of today
26:20
speaking judgment and religion and fear to people
26:25
but remember it's the kindness of God that leads to repentance not fear not
26:33
Doom not judgment [Applause]
26:38
so so number one when you're speaking do you know where you're gonna go
26:44
sinner I mean do you know where you're gonna go that's I mean even speaking like that
26:52
it's self-righteous it's the same thing we we read the
26:58
scripture last week about the Pharisee who says he sees this tax collector
27:03
ew and he says oh yeah I'm so glad that I'm I'm fasting and I'm tithing
27:11
I'm righteous and I'm so glad I'm not like this tax collector
27:17
so guess what when people preach in this way they think it is so spirit
27:23
right but the truth is when they preach in this way it's coming off the same arrogant self-righteous way to people
27:30
to people who are lost and don't know Jesus that's how it comes across do you know where you're gonna go
27:37
I'm a Christian I gave my life to Jesus do you know where you're going to go
27:42
even they can say in a way it was the best decision I ever made but it's not speaking with love it's not it was the
27:50
best decision I ever made and I want you to know Jesus
27:55
you know they can even be speaking things that sound fine oh it's true it's true there is a Heaven
28:01
There is a hell do you know where you're gonna go that's true right but they're saying it with this
28:07
self-righteousness and people pick up on it stupid
28:14
people can people can can see that this is not love
28:20
this is more judgment this is why this is why Christians and the church have
28:26
such a bad reputation I mean people in the world they see Christians as being
28:32
the most judgmental people self-righteous and judgmental people in
28:38
the world this is how the lost people the people of the world that aren't Christians see Christians
28:45
why because so many have represented Christ in the wrong way
28:50
and have spoken with judgment with judgment with judgment
28:57
I don't blame them I don't blame them of course they're going to think that way and here Christians Go full of judgment
29:03
and they're like oh these gross Sinners well it's actually your fault that they're still sinning and don't know
29:09
Jesus yet because it's your job to represent God rightly and be the salt in light of the
29:15
earth and be attractive and show the love of God so that they would be drawn towards you you're called to be Fishers
29:22
of Men and people you know when you fish you
29:29
fish you what happens I'm not an I I think I've fished one time like I was a kid but I know this about fishing you
29:35
put bait bait like something that a fish is attracted
29:41
to wants to swim towards and bite
29:47
but what so many Christians do is their bait is repelling people it's gross it's disgusting it's smelly
29:53
it tastes bad it makes them want to run away I don't want to go to church
29:59
people invite them to church and they don't go because the church smells gross to them tastes bad lived a bad taste in
30:05
their mouth the representatives of the church in their life
30:15
[Applause] Matt Matthew 23 verse 13 this is the
30:21
passion translation so Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees what I want you to understand is the
30:29
spirit of religion is what the Pharisees had so when you really want to understand the spirit of religion
30:36
read the gospels and just observe the Pharisees deserve observe their behavior
30:44
that's what we've been doing the past couple weeks we've we've been we've been reading a lot of scripture about Pharisees but they carry the spirit of
30:52
religion and so it's the same Spirit of religion or we could call the spirit of Pharisee alive today in people and
30:58
Christians so in this verse passion translation it says great sorrow awaits you religious
31:05
Scholars and you Pharisees such frauds and Pretenders
31:12
you do all you can to keep people from experiencing the reality of Heaven's
31:18
Kingdom Realm not only do you refuse to enter in
31:24
you also forbid anyone else from entering in
31:30
not only I'm going to read this again not only do you refuse to enter in you also forbid anyone else from
31:37
entering in so remember how um so two Sundays ago
31:45
when I was teaching about what the spirit of religion is I was teaching about how
31:50
when you accept a spirit of religion's lies about performance that you need to
31:55
perform you need to do all these rituals to have righteousness with God and have God happy pleased with you
32:02
and you accept that God is condemning you you think God is condemning you and judging you constantly and judging your
32:09
relationship with him he's always looking at you with this critical judgmental spirit
32:15
when you believe this about God when you that that that's the action of accepting
32:20
the spirit of religion when you believe this about God it's automatically keeping you far from God
32:28
far from God when you accept that Spirit of religion it's it's like blocking you from getting
32:34
close to God close to his heart and being intimate with him and having relationship with him and knowing his
32:40
love and receiving his love and being transformed by his love and then being like him and being loving to others
32:48
so it it keeps you it repels the spirit of religion repels you from God
32:54
from God's love from intimacy with God so when you have that Spirit of religion
33:00
in you when you when you interact with people
33:07
that spirit is repelling people from God this is so dangerous
33:17
people are being repelled from God by Christians
33:27
this is this is really serious people are thinking that they are
33:34
leading millions of people to Jesus and the fact is they aren't even
33:39
planting a seed the fact is that they are actually doing harm
33:46
because this is so dangerous to say Jesus is judgmental Jesus uh you have to perform and do
33:55
these things people don't want that that's not attractive it's not who Jesus is so
34:00
they're not going to come to Jesus they're going to go away well I don't want that go away that's so dangerous
34:08
right if this is who your Jesus is I don't want it is how people will be
34:13
is how any of us any of us would be if that was how we were introduced to
34:20
Jesus this way does not show his love
34:28
and maybe it's true it is true
34:35
the seriousness of Heaven versus hell that is true
34:41
that's not a light matter but it is not fear that brings people to
34:48
repentance so it's very dangerous to be warning
34:54
people with the fear we don't want people's introduction to
34:59
Jesus to be based on fear God does God does not want fake
35:08
relationships God gives people free will
35:15
and God wants people to come on their own accord and when people make fake relationships
35:21
like like they they they say the sinner's prayer because they've uh
35:27
because of fear because they're afraid they're going to go to hell this is going to take a lot of undoing
35:33
to get into the real relationship with God like it's it's God does not want that it's harmful for the person it can
35:42
take so long or some people some people can just be stuck forever and not know God's love and be living in fear
35:50
and be so afraid like they're thinking if I sin I'm gonna go to hell
35:56
like living in this fear because that's how they were introduced to Jesus
36:09
so it's like it's crazy because Christians you Christians are the spirit
36:15
they get angry at sinners they get angry of people in the world
36:22
whether it's Sinners they see in the political world whether it's Sinners they see
36:27
um acting worldly you know um
36:33
being in homosexual relations Sinners who are just doing drugs and and
36:40
swearing whatever Christians with a spirit of religion can get angry
36:45
like uh you're making my country so demonic
36:51
they're making my children's school so demonic
36:56
they get angry at the sinners but they're the ones repelling the sin
37:04
are doing the opposite of being kind and loving which brings repentance
37:09
[Applause]
37:19
we really could change the world we really could change our country
37:26
we could change every sphere of this nation every area
37:32
and of the whole world if we could actually represent Jesus the right way
37:38
[Applause]
37:44
because what people what what where this change will come is when people repent
37:50
people need to repent but not in the you need to repent
37:57
way repent means change repent means turn away from your sin
38:02
the way the real repentance will happen is kindness when God's kindness and love is shown not saying you need to repent
38:10
with judgment but with kindness and love showing God's love Allowing God to really move through
38:18
you that will bring repentance that will bring change in this world
38:23
Hallelujah [Applause]
38:41
First Corinthians 13 1 it says if I could speak all the
38:46
languages of Earth and of angels but didn't love others I would only be a noisy gong or a clinging symbol
38:53
if I had the gift of Prophecy and if I understood all of God's secret plans and
38:58
possessed all knowledge and if I had such faith that I could move mountains but didn't love others I would be
39:04
nothing if I gave everything I have to the poor and even sacrificed my body I could
39:09
boast about it but if I didn't love others I would have gained nothing
39:18
so I can I can preach eloquently on the
39:24
street corner in airplanes and airports and schools and at the bus stop and in subways and
39:32
in the Parks and the in the church I can preach so eloquently I can preach for so
39:37
much passion I can preach really amazing scripture like be able to
39:43
recite so much scripture powerfully I can I can be so bold
39:50
I can be so brave and speak the firm word of God
39:56
but if it's not done with love I am just a clanging symbol
40:04
[Applause] and
40:09
um this seems to be so popular in the church for people to think that they're
40:15
supposed to go out and speak in the public somewhere
40:20
or one-on-one but be preaching in this religious tone and repent and do you
40:29
know where you're gonna go and preach in this way and you can literally see the
40:34
reactions of people that they are truly a clinging annoying symbol
40:40
and I literally I've driven by people on the street corner like reason to sign up
40:46
but I can see it's a spirit of religion and I can see that this is completely
40:52
not with love that they're doing it and I literally I feel like disgusted I feel like like like uh
41:00
the clanging symbol hurting my ears hurting God's ears
41:06
because it's turning people away from God
41:12
you know you can see in people's reactions people can say oh it's demons manifesting no you're an annoying
41:20
clanging symbol [Applause]
41:30
this the the way the Samaritan woman reacted
41:35
thank you that should be people's reactions when they meet you and me
41:46
not this person's annoying
41:54
um I need to address this I need to address this um this sphere of religion in the body of Christ right now
42:01
as an apostle this needs to stop
42:06
I've seen these these these motives these impure motives just as in the Pharisees times
42:14
this motives of people evangelizing in this religious way
42:20
number one their MO this motive is performance number one they think that this is
42:27
making God happy and they're very zealous to go and preach in this religious way to so many
42:33
people and and they feel also proud
42:40
they feel proud like they are excited for people to see what an amazing
42:46
Christian they are how many people they've led to Jesus
42:51
as if it's notches on the Belt so people come with this motive and they
42:57
come with they they think I mean some people think this is the way people are led to led to Jesus if you repeat the
43:03
sinner's prayer then you will be saved they think that that means Someone Saved
43:09
and so they make it their mission through like throughout their days like this is the gospel here here listen to
43:15
me right now I want to tell you the gospel and then all right you want to give your life to Jesus okay repeat after me
43:20
oh I got one person s but they're not really saved they all
43:27
they got was religion maybe if they repeated a sinner's prayer it was of because you intimidated them and
43:33
manipulated them or it could have been of fear they're going to hell I don't want to go to hell
43:40
um and people live like this they live trying to get all these like notches on their belt
43:46
um so that they think God is happy with them and also they look impressive to
43:51
others and even you know in the times of the
43:58
Pharisees it says in Matthew 27 verse 18.
44:08
now pilate was fully aware that the religious leaders had handed Jesus over
44:15
to him because of their bitter jealousy
44:22
so it was clear that the Pharisees took down Jesus
44:28
or you know they handed him over to get crucified
44:34
because of jealousy because he had a huge thriving Ministry
44:40
and they wanted the best biggest Ministries
44:46
but they um had their way of doing Ministry it's like a call
44:52
like religious call Jesus wasn't there so preaching Jesus preaching real good
44:59
but preaching with religion preaching with judgment keeping people from knowing Jesus really
45:06
that's like what happens today people want big Ministries people want
45:12
big platforms people want videos to go viral so they'll preach boldly
45:19
and do impressive things but with the spirit of religion
45:27
and not actually having love for the people they're preaching too
45:36
so this is one of the motives the impure motives of the spirit of
45:41
religion in Ministry because it can be it can look real
45:47
because a lot of people think it's right some of you even today probably thought that was the right way to evangelize to
45:54
minister to people and so the people get so much Applause for it
46:01
and and the boldness is impressive and the people are rejoicing over people
46:06
being saved but lots of times they're not actually being saved and so we have this impure motive in in
46:13
in some places in the body of Christ and it's time that this stops
46:20
because it's bringing so much harm so much harm to people who don't know
46:26
God yet it's repelling them it's bringing them fear and judgment and it's keeping them from knowing God's love
46:32
it's time it stops amen [Applause]
46:48
so people have so many perceptions of Christians these days of being
46:54
judgmental of um being zealous but zealous uh not in a
47:01
good way this is a perception they have and they have this perception of God that he's
47:07
unfair and that he's just gonna send people to hell
47:13
easily like just with no Grace this is people's perceptions because of the
47:18
spirit of religion but what really people's perception should
47:24
be of God when they meet you and I is wow God is full of so much love
47:34
God is full of so much compassion and mercy and Grace and kindness and
47:40
patience and wow I want to know more about him
47:47
we should be drawing people and leading people and attracting people to Jesus
47:54
rather than repelling them and that's what judgment fear
47:59
does performance does so
48:05
now I want to teach you what Ministry should look like how ministering to others what this
48:10
should look like Galatians 5 verse 22.
48:18
but the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives love joy peace
48:23
patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self-control
48:29
Was Fear there no was judgment there no was performance there no
48:35
these are the fruits of the spirit and so when you talk about God when you
48:42
interact with people when you minister to people these fruits should come out
48:48
of you and touch people that's what should happen this is
48:54
everything right here you don't need to worry about the specifics when it comes to ministering
49:00
to people you don't need to worry about like a checklist of things you need to do to minister to someone what you need
49:07
to be focused on is that you are carrying these fruits which come by getting close to God Amen
49:16
you should be worrying about carrying these fruits and getting these fruits out of you to touch the people you're
49:21
talking to and ministering to that's the only you should be so intentional about that you should be
49:27
thinking about that so much as I'm talking it should be full of kindness it should be full of gentleness it should
49:33
be full of so much love I'm going to be intentional to love this person so well the tone of my voice it must come with
49:40
sweetness with gentleness with kindness I must have self-control I I must show compassion I must show
49:47
Grace that should be your intention completely when you're
49:54
ministering to someone when you're interacting with people not okay I'm going to recite the gospel and now I'm
50:00
and then after that I'm going to lead them into the sinner's prayer and then my job is done on to the next
50:09
without thinking about really representing god without thinking about how you're sounding and what's actually
50:15
coming out of you now the Bible says
50:21
um First Corinthians 3 verse 5.
50:28
we are only God's servants through whom you believed the good news
50:35
Paul is saying we Apollos Paul we are God's servant through whom you believe
50:41
the good news you believed it through us see this is how people get to know who
50:47
Jesus is through us amen generally not other ways it's
50:54
generally this is the way each of us did the work the lord gave us I planted the seed in your hearts
51:04
and Apollos watered it but it was God who made it grow
51:10
it's not important who does the planning or who does the watering what's important is that God makes the seed grow
51:16
the one who plants and the one who Waters work together with the same purpose and both will be rewarded for their own
51:23
hard work for we are both God's workers and you are God's field you are God's
51:29
Building so when it comes to someone actually
51:34
being saved this is on their own free will and this
51:40
is on God's timing people with a spirit of religion Performance Based like I need to get
51:47
people saved they don't understand this they think that they're the ones that
51:54
makes this it to grow but God is the one that makes it to grow on God's timing
52:00
and so they think I'm on a mission to get people saved ten hands were raised ten people were
52:07
saved this isn't who knows if someone's really saved only God knows the heart
52:16
it's funny that we actually think we can measure and be responsible for someone's salvation
52:23
the narrow road is where we are saved surrendered life is where we were saved not when we raise our hands and
52:29
repeaters sinner's prayer after me by the way the sinner's prayer is not in
52:35
the Bible but a lot of people think it is because of religion because it's a religion has
52:40
these man-made traditions and they think this is this is the way that's the only way this is in the Bible it's not even the Bible
52:46
it says in the Bible when you believe in your heart that Jesus is your lord and savior and you confess with your mouth
52:53
then you will be saved it's much more simpler than the long
52:59
prescripted sinner's prayer that has to be repeated after me at a certain time of service
53:05
it's much simpler and it's supposed to be from the heart that when you decide on your own time in
53:13
God's timing and on your time because God's doing growing God's doing a pursuing thing he's growing you so when
53:19
it's ripe in God's time in your time your your free will In God's Time
53:25
you decide I want to give my whole life to Jesus I want to make Jesus my Lord
53:31
Jesus You're My Lord that's it you're saved
53:37
[Applause] Hallelujah
53:44
it can be many different things Jesus you're my God Jesus you're my savior or even if you're in your heart you're like
53:50
you believe Jesus is is Lord and you just say Jesus that's enough
53:56
it could just be Jesus that's it you're saved Hallelujah
54:04
okay so our job is to be a vessel of God and holy spirit is is doing what he
54:11
wants to do we can't control anything we can't manipulate anything it's God doing the work we're to be vessels and so God
54:18
goes slow with his people he doesn't Rush people he's such a gentleman so we have to
54:24
represent him well in that area God's not ready for someone to be saved because he they need some time to grow
54:31
first because he doesn't want to be premature you know how it can be dangerous if you get married prematurely
54:39
you need to get married when you're feeling in your heart I really want to get married now I'm ready or that could
54:44
be a disaster you could end up in a divorce simply because it's too early so you see this is how it works there's
54:51
planting there's watering and God's growing and they're talking about salvation
54:58
about salvation here so stop we got to get this religious
55:03
Doctrine out of your mind like you need to plant grow it and water and bring the
55:10
Harvest in five minutes every day several times
55:17
chill out [Applause]
55:28
man [Applause] my yoke is easy my burden is light
55:35
let God do the work you just be a vessel of him and plant when he says plant and
55:41
water when he says water and harvest when he says Harvest so you you need to to treat people
55:49
differently okay you need to go in in the workplace in your family wherever
55:54
you're interacting with people you're constantly in the the the ministry Fields it's time to minister but it
56:01
doesn't mean it's time to be preaching the gospel and having people recite the sinner's prayer every single time no it's gonna look different
56:08
it's going to look simple like this okay ready this is what it looks like love
56:14
loving people [Applause]
56:19
when you love people it's not you it's God through you
56:24
so when you love people people are encountering God and they're like what is that
56:31
I've I felt loved before but that was different what was that this is the light of the
56:38
world happening
56:45
the Bible I'm Blinded By the Light now who we the Bible says that we are called to be
56:52
the light of the world and the salts of the Earth
56:58
we're not called to be some gross taste something dark that brings fear and
57:06
heaviness and annoyance and distraction when I'm just trying to go about my day I'm here and you're going to go to hell
57:12
repent but we're called to be the light we're
57:18
called to bring life and light to people's lives we're called to bring salt to people's lives
57:25
that's where it's simple we're call you're called to be the light you're called to be salt you're called to love people
57:31
and God's the one doing the work so all you have to do is love people and he does the rest
57:38
you you'll be loving people you'll just be loving somebody you're not you're not
57:43
pressuring them you're you're occasionally you know talking about testimonies in your life
57:50
they start to get interested in you in your life more because they're receiving
57:55
so much love from you they're feeling they can trust you they start opening up they start asking you questions like why
58:02
do you have so much joy and peace I don't I don't get it I've never seen that before and and why why do you treat me like so
58:08
loving and I was like mean to you and you you like loved me still they noticed these things they'll start to open up
58:14
they're attracted they're coming closer and and that's that's the time for a
58:20
watering to take place before you planted the seed you planted seed by loving them by loving them when they didn't deserve
58:27
it by making intention I am on the mission field I am doing Ministry today so I am showing people the love of God
58:33
with whatever I do I'm loving my enemies I'm turning my cheek I'm being humble I'm being full of grace I'm being full
58:39
of compassion I'm being kind I'm being generous so you live your life that way with that
58:46
serious intention Lord help me be this way and and as you're interacting with people showing
58:52
them this love planting seed after seed after seed
58:59
and then sometimes you'll get to plant and you'll get to water at the same time sometimes you'll be planting those seeds
59:05
and then the people will open up they will be asking you those questions and this is a time of watering Jesus now you can preach
59:13
now not not before not perform the water yet just love them where they're at let them come to you
59:20
let them be attracted Don't Force free will give them Free Will Don't Force the
59:26
gospel down their throat because it pushes them away
59:32
so now you can preach but Don't Preach religious
59:38
chill out calm down don't lose my it's my opportunity to get
59:44
something let anybody to the Lord oh this is my day
59:51
you start getting nervous you start sweating and you start not you start sounding weird and you're like never
59:56
mind I I'm feeling tired I'm thinking I'm going to take a nap
1:00:02
be real with them tell them Jesus I used to be this way and now I'm this way I
1:00:08
used to be lost I used to be oppressed I used to be sick and I encountered God he
1:00:14
is real and he literally took all this away from me and he healed me and not just that I have Supernatural peace and
1:00:20
joy his love is so amazing
1:00:27
and you speak naturally chill out you speak naturally real be real and this is showing love
1:00:35
this is like the Samaritan woman experience God's love and I want you to experience it too not some performance
1:00:43
I want to get a Salvation notch on my belt through you they can see right through it
1:00:48
have love for the people I want them to be saved so I'm going to speak from my heart so they can know it's from my
1:00:54
heart so they can know it's real so they can be attracted more to God and me and
1:01:00
they're going to want to come to church with me they're going to want to hear more so you speak in that way that's attracting that's real that's really
1:01:05
loving the person amen
1:01:11
and at that point you've watered and maybe that same person maybe God
1:01:17
will call you to bring a harvest which can look different things because it's not up to a person to lead a person in
1:01:24
the sinner's prayer for them to be saved sometimes the Harvest moment may be there they want to come to church with
1:01:29
you and that day they come to church and they encounter God and they give their lives to Jesus that day you brought in the Harvest but God did the work and it
1:01:36
wasn't you or it wasn't even me leading them through a sinner's prayer but when God touched them they said Jesus I give
1:01:42
my life to you so that's how it's supposed to look like if God is calling you to plant water and
1:01:50
bring Harvest to one person but for most of you you're only going to be doing one of these things like what Paul talks about one person plants one person
1:01:57
Waters others he's a harvest this is why I tell you chill out
1:02:04
stop being obsessed to see the Harvest wait on God's timing do your part to
1:02:10
plant do the be the best planter instead of trying to bring in the Harvest when it's not time and you're doing more harm
1:02:15
be the best planner you can be love people so well for years and they're not
1:02:21
coming to Jesus yet but keep planting seeds
1:02:26
love keep planting seeds be patient and trust that God is doing work is making
1:02:32
it to grow and there will be a harvest someday it might be maybe with somebody else
1:02:37
but just rest now when you did your part amen
1:02:43
Hallelujah Hallelujah
1:02:51
and I also want to um speak on this
1:02:57
Proverbs 3 12 the Lord corrects those he loves just as a father corrects a child in
1:03:04
whom he Delights so um there should be times for correction
1:03:11
me as an apostle eyes do this sometimes I rebuke you you know it says in the
1:03:17
word we're called to rebuke is one of the things and edify and these things
1:03:23
but you are children of God you've AR you've encountered God's love
1:03:30
so now you can you can get you can start to get lazy maybe and I can come with a sharp Direction
1:03:37
why aren't you taking your surrender seriously that's okay then
1:03:43
but you were children of God disciples already
1:03:49
it says the Lord corrects us he loves just as a father corrects a child in whom he Delights
1:03:55
people who are lost are not children of God yet so stop correcting them
1:04:01
just love them it's not time to correct them why are
1:04:07
you sinning of course they're sin what question for them instead see them see
1:04:14
them with these eyes they don't know God's love I want them to know God's love the only way they're going to know
1:04:20
God's love is through us the main way is through people so I am going to do all I
1:04:25
can so that God can use me and they can know God's love and be saved
1:04:31
from their sin and from not going to hell having this compassion for people this
1:04:38
is how we should see everyone who doesn't know God stop judging them
1:04:43
of course they're sinning can we have love for them that's the only way that they will turn from their
1:04:50
ways they need to know God's love they didn't have the grace you've had yet they
1:04:55
didn't have the upbringing you had the Christian upbringing they didn't have the church that has the anointing in it
1:05:01
they haven't had these experiences that you've had yet have compassion for them
1:05:06
you used to be lost too you used to be blind too
1:05:13
this is their only chance it's for the love of God to move through us amen
1:05:21
[Applause] and acts 1 verse 7.
1:05:29
the disciples are wanting to know when Jesus was going to return and he says the father alone has the authority to
1:05:35
set those dates and times and they are not for you to know but you will receive power when the Holy
1:05:42
Spirit comes upon you and you will be my Witnesses telling people about me everywhere in Jerusalem throughout Judea
1:05:49
and Samaria and to the ends of the Earth so the disciples were wanting to know
1:05:55
when are you returning Jesus we want to know we want to be thinking about it we want we want to be planning for when are
1:06:01
you coming and Jesus simply goes it's not for you to know and he quickly shifts
1:06:07
but you shall receive power and you need to be my Witnesses and go to the ends of the Earth in other words
1:06:13
we do not need to be talking end times end times end times the end is near are you going to go to Hell or Heaven do you
1:06:19
know we are called to receive the power of God and be Witnesses and do the work of
1:06:26
God and be serious about the work of God and show God's love to people
1:06:32
we are not to be focused on the end times like this we will be ready when we are surrendered
1:06:38
to God you're already ready you're prepared you're not prepared by focusing on Doom and speaking doom and fear to
1:06:46
people that's not how you're going to be prepared that's the opposite of being prepared
1:06:53
so you're prepared by surrendering to God and doing God's work and being in his will
1:07:00
you know this is the attitude we should have we don't we have no idea the time or day but we are called to live day by day
1:07:06
every day has enough worry of its own God says so on this day I'm going to be a witness of God flowing in his
1:07:13
anointing and showing his love to everybody I can everyone who comes in my
1:07:18
path that's what God's calling us to do amen Hallelujah
1:07:24
Hallelujah so I want to encourage you when you when
1:07:29
you speak with people from now don't feel this this fear for them like
1:07:36
they could go to hell just because that blocks the love for you you're carrying the spirit of fear
1:07:42
yourself relax it's up it's there in God's hands
1:07:49
you can do something about it but not by fearing but by resting in God
1:07:55
being surrendered to him so you can be transformed into his image and so you can represent him the best
1:08:01
way which is full of love full of joy full of Peace when you interact with
1:08:07
people be full of joy when you talk about God you should be speaking about how amazing
1:08:13
he is the times that you are like preaching to
1:08:18
people or something be full of joy God is so good speak about how he's
1:08:24
touched your life be full of peace and gentleness
1:08:31
let people sense the fruit of the spirit through you rather than
1:08:38
feeling like you're preaching you're preaching to them and coming with fear and coming with
1:08:45
judgment and trying to to to get them saved be full of joy and peace and love and
1:08:54
gentleness and kindness when you talk to anybody about God with every post you make on social media
1:09:00
let the fruits of the spirit flow through you that alone amen this is how people will truly be saved
1:09:07
and this is how the world will transform this is how people will get to know
1:09:13

1:09:34
some of you I see some of you you became saved through these religious preachings
1:09:44
some of you even you know you you you said the sinner's prayer more because you know that it was the
1:09:50
right thing to do rather than from your heart wanting to surrender you had these arranged marriages with
1:09:57
Jesus rather than coming to him on your own accord
1:10:04
and I see today right now right now some of you have even been saved for a while have are not surrendered but I see right
1:10:10
now God wants to wipe away that that that
1:10:15
wrong start and he wants today to be the real
1:10:21
marriage with him where you see him rightly
1:10:28
full of love and you and your heart are Desiring to be one with him and give your life to
1:10:36

1:11:33
