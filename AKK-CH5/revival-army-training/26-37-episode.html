I've been doing a series on my book The Secret of the anointing here which I
0:05
recently released and we've been concluding this series with the topic of
0:11
the last chapter of maintaining the anointing I've been teaching you how to maintain the anointing because once you
0:18
receive the anointing you are not guaranteed to keep it or for it to grow
0:23
more and more it's not a guarantee you have to take action to make sure you
0:28
maintain it and it grows in you amen and so if you have not seen the
0:36
previous teachings we have a playlist on my YouTube channel and fful Church's YouTube channel called The Secret of the
0:41
anointing so you can find all the messages there make sure you go back and watch them um after this service today
0:48
I'm going to be teaching on another part of how to maintain the anointing you have received and that is to honor to
0:57
give honor where honor is due I'm going to be teaching about the power
1:03
of Honor today so there's many commands that God
1:10
gives us in the word there's so many different commands he gives us and I and and what can happen is
1:18
people can neglect certain commands and put more focus on other
1:27
commands what will really help keep us keep us help keep us from not doing that
1:34
not neglecting any of the commands not overlooking any of the commands what will really help us is to have
1:41
understanding of the commands because God does not give us
1:47
commands instructions just to Lord them over
1:52
us just to be like here do these things just cuz I just for no reason CU I want
1:59
you to do them that's it no God gives us commands for a
2:05
reason and this is the reason it helps us it's for our good it
2:12
brings us closer to God it makes us be more spiritual it makes us have victory
2:17
over the devil it helps us to make sure we're staying in God's will for our lives it helps us to make sure we are
2:24
fulfilling our purpose our calling it it when we obey
2:29
God commands this is how the kingdom of God can come on this Earth through us this is how we are able to be a powerful
2:35
vessel of God this is how we are able to be pleasing to God Amen like that's the power of the
2:43
word of God that's the power of God's instruction there there it's the blueprint that leads us to eternal life
2:53
to purposeful life to Abundant Life to a god-pleasing life Hallelujah and and so
3:00
that's such an important thing about having revelation of the word because you can read the word and not have a
3:05
revelation but when you have Revelation it's like the word really becomes a part
3:10
of you rather than something in and out you're hearing you you I mean you read and that's it it's just knowledge head
3:16
knowledge but it becomes a part of you and you value it it you value it you
3:22
want to obey it because you love God and you want to be obedient but also you know the power of obeying
3:28
it following the instructions you know what will happen when you follow the instructions you know the good that it
3:35
will bring you you know how you will grow you know how you will receive more anointing
3:43
amen for example like um I remember as a teenager in my 20s I didn't quite
3:50
understand the instructions of don't get drunk you know don't don't sleep outside
3:59
of marriage sleep with people sleep around sleep with people outside of marriage you know you don't really understand that as a teen without proper
4:05
teaching and everyone else is doing it and it just doesn't really make sense you don't see really the harm in it so
4:11
you're just like I don't I don't understand it just God says this but then as as my eyes opened up I realized
4:19
wow this if when you engage in these things you open up doors to demons and
4:25
then you go from having freedom and Abundant Life to bondage to oppression to torment so that is not worth
4:36
it amen and and and and then because you
4:43
see that God is so good to give you those instructions to help you to bless you it opens up your eyes of God's
4:50
love so you're instantly that's what happened for me when my eyes open up to these like that truth those principles
4:57
my love for God grew my my respect my reverence for him grew my trust in him
5:02
grew amen so it's so important for us to have understanding this is why we need
5:08
anointed teaching to bring revelation of the word of God because we can't really
5:14
we can't do it all on our own we can't have just the Bible and that's it and the Holy Spirit and that's
5:20
it no Ephesians 4:11 God gave the apostles prophets evangelists pastors
5:25
and teachers for the equipping of the Saints so what are they equipping without the word of God no they're
5:31
equipping by bringing the word of God to Life by bringing revelation of the word
5:37
of God they're not bring not bringing equipping without the word of God it's centered on the word of
5:42
God that's the meaning of equipping a big meaning is is re God giving
5:48
Revelation that the Believers haven't gotten quite they have some but more Revelation is given specifically to F
5:56
the five-fold ministry for the purpose of equipping you
6:01
opening your eyes giving you more understanding amen all right so I'm teaching you today
6:08
the power of Honor because we many people don't
6:13
understand why honor is important and so therefore they don't do it they neglect it so today you shall
6:20
have revelation of what it means to honor what happens when you
6:26
honor when you bring honor to a person
6:31
amen
6:40
hallelujah Romans 13:7 pay to all what is owed to them
6:46
taxes to whom taxes are owed Revenue to whom revenue is owed respect to whom
6:52
respect is owed honor to whom honor is
6:58
owed so this is where we have this command from God that give honor where
7:04
honor is due give honor where honor is olded so first of all I want to explain
7:11
this teaching like what this teaching means it means when a person has done something worthy of honor when a person
7:18
has blessed your life when a person has been used by God to touch you to help you to bless you to reveal God's love to
7:25
you um when a person has done something for the body Body of Christ when a
7:31
person maybe you haven't even seen them bless you but you've seen them bless another that's something worthy of honor
7:37
too amen when a person uses their gifts their time their energy sacrifice to be
7:46
a blessing to do good in this
7:51
world then that person is deemed worthy of honor so what it means
7:58
is God is asking people to when they see that when they see someone is worthy of
8:04
honor honors should be given to this person because of what who they are what
8:09
they've done you should give it so that's just an explanation simple
8:16
explanation of the command that God has given us
8:25
amen and I'm going to be speaking today just in honor in general honoring people
8:31
in general firstly so number
8:38
one the the reason why God wants us to honor those who are
8:45
worthy of honor is because
8:50
honoring is a characteristic of
8:56
humility honoring is a characteristic of of humility what is
9:03
humility there are different parts of the meaning of humility and when God is
9:09
testing someone to see if they have humility he'll test them in different areas like do they have this do they
9:15
have this are they doing this are they doing this then that person is a humble
9:20
person so for example here here's one example of how humility is
9:27
measured it's measured by humility is measured by a lack of showing
9:34
off not boasting in on self
9:39
now when you are surrendered to God now you're in partnership with
9:45
God and every day God is working with you and through you to do his work on
9:53
this Earth amen and so God's going to do
9:58
great things through through you with you and through you there will be achievements there will be
10:05
liftings there will be good things that happen to you because of what God's doing through you and with
10:13
you I say with you because you have to choose to obey you're not a robot and
10:19
God moving through you you have to choose to obey so though God moves through you he's also working with you a
10:26
partnership amen Hallelujah so when blessings good things happen
10:34
achievements happen you should celebrate the blessing the achievement
10:41
the lifting but when you celebrate it when you announce it
10:47
even you should always be including God and giving him the
10:56
glory making it known IGN acknowledging it's only by God's grace this has
11:02
happened glory to God there's different ways you can say it you can you can word
11:08
it but that should be your heart and that should be the words and the action that you're giving God the glory
11:15
it should be known that this was a partnership between you and God and he was the main one who did
11:21
this and it's important that we aren't like uh don't have false humility and we
11:27
hide achievements and bless SC in our liveses for fear that people will see us
11:32
as prideful we shouldn't we should never do that that's Disobedience actually
11:38
because we need to give God credit we need to give God glory this is part of giving God glory I am blessed God has
11:46
blessed me I did this and there was success there by God's help and strength
11:51
it's all because of God this is Supernatural I couldn't do this on my own it wasn't until I surrendered till
11:57
this happened this blessing this achievement this dream coming true happened
12:02
amen so we do need to announce it don't be ashamed don't think it's not humble
12:10
this is part of giving God glory number one and number two it's a testimony for others it will encourage others whoa
12:16
look how this person was blessed by God I I can trust God I think I want to
12:22
leave the world now and give my life to God because I see how this person's blessed in many different areas
12:30
it can be even physical blessings it can even be material things sometimes you don't have to be ashamed give God the
12:37
glory and encourage others amen
12:43
[Applause] hallelujah so that's one way that God measures humility is that this lack of
12:51
showing off that you're not trying to prove something you're not trying to look awesome like because you want
12:56
people to say look I'm so great no you don't have an ego you you just care to bring God glory
13:05
and you're and and with your heart and your words and your actions it is seen that you know this is God and this is
13:12
for God's glory this isn't for you to get attention that's one of the ways that
13:18
God measures humility and one of the aspects of humility all right so we're going to now
13:24
go to um the next way humility is
13:30
measured the next way humility is measured is by gratitude gratitude not just when you
13:38
receive blessings like big blessings but gratitude in all
13:44
circumstances contentment even in the valley that there would be gratitude because even in
13:51
the valley God is still with you and God is still good and his promises still remain to be true and the valley is only
13:57
temporary and God has done so many blessings in your life thus far and even giving breath in your lungs and all the
14:04
blessings that you still have in the valley like loved ones God's presence relationship with God they're still
14:12
there amen so there are still reasons to be
14:17
grateful there are still reasons to be grateful in the valley even such as refining fire is your prayer
14:26
answered I mean this is you want to be more like God you want your purpose fulfilled well you need to be more like
14:32
him how do you become more like him you got to go through the fire the fire looks like
14:38
valleys so you need to be grateful in all circumstances even in the valley so
14:46
when things are happening attacks are coming are you complaining or are you choosing to be
14:53
obedient to be content and to be grateful and to still praise God
15:00
if you're complaining complaining complaining more then that's showing that there isn't really humility
15:07
there it's showing that you feel entitled to have what you
15:14
want and never go through things that's what it
15:21
shows so this is the other way that humility is measured by your gratitude
15:30
con constant gratitude the next way humility is
15:37
measured is by when your character is smeared false
15:46
accusations spoken against you what is your
15:52
response that's the big test of humility when you're
15:59
is the place to see where you have ego or not if you really care what people think
16:05
about you that's the big testing so if it's really Your Heart
16:11
Lord I don't I don't care what I have to go through I don't care what I have to go through for your will to be
16:20
done if that's your heart then when when Temptation comes of people speaking
16:29
falsely against you it won't bother you that much I mean
16:34
it'll still hurt yes but it won't bother you to the extent where you get angry
16:41
you let anger take over you it won't bother you to the extent where you start defending yourself and speaking this is
16:48
what this person did this is the truth but you let God defend
16:57
you amen [Applause] it won't bother you to the extent that
17:03
you are so distracted on what people are saying and how people are seeing you but
17:10
instead you are focused still on the work of God on what God has called you to
17:17
do amen so God's watching these things when these attacks come he'll allow
17:24
these attacks to come as a test to measure your human
17:32
humility when you really are humble when these things happen you'll say well it's not about me Jesus was a man of no
17:40
reputation and I know God will bring Vindication he will defend me it's not about
17:47
me I died to myself and I'm here to serve God so if people think wrong
17:54
things against me who cares I don't care I I died to my ego I died to
18:00
myself I made that choice decision Covenant so how dare I care that much
18:07
what people think it's not about me anymore it's now about God only
18:20
amen another way humility is measured is by your
18:27
selflessness selflessness that you would put people before
18:34
yourself and one of the well here's one scripture Philippians 2:3 do nothing out
18:39
of selfish ambition or vain conceit rather in humility value others above
18:49
yourselves not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the
18:57
others so putting another before yourself being
19:05
selfless one of the ways that we do this is by
19:12
honoring honoring others because
19:20
um honoring edifies another it uplifts a definition of edify is to uplift and to
19:28
Elevate that's one of part of the meanings of to edify is to uplift and to
19:34
elevate and really what it means is certain people in your life if they have
19:41
done things to bless you if they've just been done good things in general when you honor them what you're doing is
19:47
you're just speaking the truth or you're showing action of the truth through the
19:53
honor you're speaking the truth this person blessed me this person did this good
19:59
thing that's what's happening and when you take time to do that when you make the effort to do that you are putting
20:08
attention on another person rather than yourself and you are lifting the person
20:15
instead of lifting yourself you're uplifting them elevating
20:21
them so when you don't have humility you're not really thinking this way
20:28
you're not thinking how can I lift others when you're not humble your main
20:34
motive is to make people see you in a good way look what I've done yeah I've
20:41
done this you ever sometimes you can be talking with someone and they're just like bragging for no reason like where do we get into this
20:48
conversation you know what I mean like you you're just kind of like okay you you know obviously what they're doing
20:54
it's kind of awkward right because you're just talking about one thing and all of a sudden out of
21:00
nowhere it has nothing to do with conversation they're saying I've done this and I've done this and I've done
21:05
this and I cool that's amazing Hallelujah you
21:12
know but you know and this is what I this gives Insight the reason that
21:17
they're talking about these things for no reason is because that's in their
21:22
heart of I want to lift up myself I want people to see how good I
21:30
am the good I've done and that's coming
21:35
out but the opposite way to be selfless is you're not thinking about yourself when you're in a conversation with
21:41
someone you're not like I want to Puff myself up I want them to see how great I am but instead you're like I want to be
21:48
a vessel of God and show love to this person I want to bless them I want God
21:53
to use me to bless them through my words through my actions to serve
21:59
them that's how we should be amen and so when that's your heart
22:06
you'll probably be an honoring person like automatically you will notice certain
22:12
good things this person has done or ways God is using them or how they've blessed
22:17
you and your attention is there rather than how can I make myself look great
22:24
your attention is there so you actually see it you notice it and so you just call it out you just naturally edify
22:30
them you blessed me by doing this wow God used you powerfully as you did this
22:36
those words that you spoke the way you smile I see how you serve god um I see
22:43
how you work so hard for God that's amazing so in that moment and then if
22:49
there are people around or you're doing it publicly if you're doing on social media in that moment instead of using
22:55
this moment to speak about yourself how great you are you're instead speaking
23:01
about another and lifting them up so you're literally lifting them up
23:06
and not lifting yourself up you're putting them above you and that that's like that's the meaning of being selfless looking to
23:14
your own not looking to your own interests but to the interests of
23:21
others [Applause]
23:26
amen Romans 12:10 be devoted to one another in
23:32
love honor one another above yourselves honor one another AB above
23:42
yourselves this is another instruction of Honor that God gives so this is the first Power of Honor like why honoring
23:50
is so powerful is because this is one of the ways we make ourselves humble you
23:56
know how in the word it says so many times humble yourselves it's saying to be humble it's
24:03
not saying ask God to make you humble it's saying you humble yourself you take
24:09
the action to humble yourself and so I went through a bunch
24:15
of the ways to be humble this is one of them if you want to know how to be
24:21
humble here's one of the ways honor others honor those who are worthy of
24:28
honor where honor is due honor one another above
24:34
yourselves hallelujah praise
24:43
God thank you Jesus so number two The Power of Honor
24:51
why honoring is so powerful is that it edifies
24:59
others so number number one we're we're lifting up others as a way of humbling
25:05
ourselves but number two we are edifying others because God has instructed us to
25:11
edify others so that God can they can feel
25:17
God's love they can know God's love through you as you edify them
25:23
amen 1 Thessalonians 5:11 therefore comfort each other and edify one another
25:32
just as you also are doing this is one of the big ways that God strengthens and
25:39
lifts another person is by you edifying them by you honoring them by you calling
25:45
out these things wow look this is amazing what you've done for God it encourages them
25:51
it's one of the big ways that God in lifts the person up
25:58
we God instructs several times that as a body of Christ we should edify one
26:03
another amen and this is why because otherwise
26:09
we will be beaten up by the devil we need people in the body to Speak Life to
26:18
us not just be healed be free but to prophetically
26:24
speak God used you powerfully in in this way you have a amazing gift on your
26:34
life you know encourage them this is so important that we do this for one
26:39
another this is this is how we have victory over the devil when we are encouraged by God and this is one of the
26:44
big ways that God encourages other people through people through us
26:51
hallelujah so think about about the powerful thing you're doing as you're honoring this is you edifying other
26:57
people it's helping them it's strengthening them in the Lord It's a way God is using you God is speaking
27:03
through you to them so that they can have Victory
27:08
amen when we all edify one another in the body we will all be
27:15
stronger it's powerful see how beautiful honoring
27:22
is so this is I'm just speaking about honoring people in general because when
27:28
God speaks of Honor he's speaking of honoring all sorts of people who is worthy of honor honor your parents honor
27:34
your mother and father and you will be blessed you will live a long life the Bible says that's a powerful meaning of
27:41
Honor wow blessings will come to you so I've been speaking right now honor in general
27:47
because God wants us to honor everybody honor every person is worthy of honor in some way and respect as a child of God
27:56
you should never treat someone bad for one reason because they're a child of God they're loved by God even if they've
28:03
done wrong they've done evil they are still a child of God God still loves
28:08
them so they're worthy of some sort of some level of honor amen so now I'm going to be
28:17
teaching specifically the importance and power of honoring Servants of
28:24
God as a second like topic a second meaning of
28:29
the power of honoring First Kings 194 he came to a
28:36
broom Bush sat down under it and prayed that he might die this is Elijah Elijah
28:41
was being um hunted down to be killed by
28:47
Jezebel and all of just the enemies and attacks coming towards his life was so strong that he came to this point and he
28:54
said he sat under it and prayed that that he might die I have had enough Lord
29:01
he said take my life I am no better than my
29:07
ancestors so okay Elijah was not just anybody he wasn't
29:14
somebody suffering an oppression with a suicidal Spirit he wasn't someone spiritually
29:22
immature that didn't know how to reject the lies of the devil he is standard okay he was a
29:30
servant of God a chosen Prophet so to see that he got to this
29:37
point indicates how heavy the persecution was how intense the devil
29:44
was attacking him we are still human Servants of God
29:49
are still humans we are not robots indestructible robots or
29:55
something well it's not like all crazy attacks are coming at us and we're just like praise
30:02
God and all that all the weapons coming at
30:08
us we're still human and this really proves it through
30:15
Elijah you know
30:21
um if a person you know I if tons of people speak so many
30:27
mean things at me it could have an
30:33
effect I can do my best to don't put my eye there or ear there but sometimes you
30:39
don't have a choice sometimes it's bombarding you didn't want to hear it you didn't want to see it but you're
30:44
forced to and we know what to do when this happens we renew our mind with the truth
30:52
and we meditate we reject the lies and we meditate on God's truth these are
30:57
just lies I meditate on God's truth God loves me no enemy will succeed God has
31:04
called me the promises will come to pass and there's such power in that and you
31:10
you can have peace and joy throughout any kind of attack right this is true
31:16
but I do want to say that like if there's tons of of hateful mean things
31:22
being spewed at you at any person no matter how strong they are in the Lord it will have an
31:30
effect it will have an effect of heaviness God can move just as
31:35
powerfully through a person it's the difference of me you know going through maybe so much hate and coming here and
31:41
feeling like heaviness but still flying in the Lord by his grace like still still can
31:50
Minister still can smile still can be strong but there is a
31:56
heaviness and it is more effort it takes more
32:02
effort you know versus not having all of that not having so much like hate but
32:11
instead of word words of life being spoken good words the heaviness isn't there the you
32:17
know I'm just trying to put it into perspective how we're not
32:23
robots that if there's so much negative coming to A person there will be an
32:28
effect you will still have Victory but there is like still an effect and that's what we see with
32:34
Elijah okay so this shows how intense the attacks were he was spiritually
32:40
mature it was just that the attacks were so bad he had had
32:47
it and some sometimes Servants of God sometimes they can even maybe sometimes
32:54
they can even go early sometimes like this situation where the persecution
32:59
just got so intense it's happened in the past you know so I share this with you for you to
33:08
know the importance of showing honor where honor is due to Servants of God
33:16
number one for the reason of edifying
33:21
them if the eye we're a whole body of Christ if the eye is being attacked
33:27
attacked attacked hit at so many arrows coming at the eye is the rest of the
33:33
body going to just sit there the rest of the body should do
33:39
something to help out the part of the body that is being attack so
33:44
brutally they shouldn't just sit there quiet they should do something what do we do we don't lash
33:53
out we don't come with hate we don't fight back we let God fight the battles but we show honor we speak the
34:00
truth we edify
34:08
[Applause] amen so when when um when a servant of
34:18
God is having so much hate spoken at them maybe what happened so many times to True Ser anointed Servants of God is
34:25
they are called false just like Jesus was called called false that's the big one so there's false false false hate
34:32
hate hate all these horrible nasty things being said lies being said like they said about Jesus where they said
34:39
he's using demonic powers to cast out demons so those type of things come toward Servants of God those lies those
34:44
false accusations false accusations like the Miracles aren't real stuff like that that's the kind of thing that every
34:51
anointed servant of God goes up against the attacks that come and it's constant
34:56
there's sometimes where where it's tons there's sometimes where it's not as much there's different seasons but I'm telling you from experience it is
35:02
constant it is every day that those types of attacks that I just described you're false the Miracles aren't real
35:08
all this that comes like every day those words
35:14
come um every day all the time so what I'm
35:20
saying is that the body of Christ has a responsibility to do something
35:29
not you don't have to do tons all you're asked to do is to show honor edify Speak
35:35
Life speak the truth Miracles aren't real people are
35:41
saying Miracles are real I've received a
35:50
miracle this P this servant of God is false this servant of God is true I can
35:56
testify why my life transformed I fell more in love with Jesus I got closer to
36:02
him than ever I be I was delivered I was healed and the Bible says you shall know them by their fruits these are the most
36:08
fruits I've ever seen in my life so therefore this I know with all my heart this servant of God is
36:17
true and so um in terms of just even the servant of God it strengthens the
36:23
servant of God it's a you become a vessel of God to that to that servant of God saying
36:30
it's worth it it's worth it it's worth all the persecution it's worth all the ATT
36:36
attacks it's all worth all the hate it's worth all of the um character
36:41
assassination smearing it's worth all of that because God is able to do such
36:48
powerful things through you people are really truly being
36:53
blessed look this person's being blessed this person's being blessed this person being this person is being blessed this
36:59
person's healed this person's delivered it's worth it like God speaks this to us
37:05
to Servants of God but one of the big ways that God chooses to speak it is through the
37:12
body amen so I'm telling you like this is so
37:18
important for you to know the power of your honor the power of your testimony
37:24
the power of your words just speaking the truth just simply speaking the truth of the testimony in your life of how God
37:31
uses servant of God is so powerful what you're doing I know I experience that I
37:37
experience that every day every day I literally feel such encouragement from
37:45
God and and love from God through your honor through your testimonies through
37:50
just you just sharing the truth every day I literally feel God's
37:56
love through through you when you do that and then there was such a you know
38:02
I can't respond to them all I can't respond to them all but I'm telling you there's not one one like testimony
38:09
honoring that has not blessed me tremendously like every single one truly
38:15
blesses me and I feel God's love through it and I'm strengthened by it
38:20
and a lot of you know I went through the hardest time of my life where I faced just so much
38:27
persecution um two years ago almost exactly two years ago and um it was just
38:33
so much like false accusations and on a public display um and it was really hard
38:42
and it was just like so much hate coming at me and and lies and everything and in
38:47
the midst of this I was ministering like almost every day as this was happening I
38:54
I remember when it happened the the I mean the beginning of this big attack was uh right before a three-day
39:02
conference I was ministering for three days in a row um in uh Kentucky and I was back
39:10
here at in La every Sunday um before and after doing a live just like almost every day ministering and that takes
39:18
strength amen and um but I'm telling you what got me through that I got through
39:25
that I didn't have to like uh cancel on a Ministry uh service or
39:30
something like that no no no no I was strong through it by by the grace of God
39:37
but one of the big reasons that one of the ways that God strengthened me was through many of you and many others that
39:43
just spoke encouragement and honor and spoke up and just testified I have
39:49
received this is real this is true so thank you to those of you who back
39:58
then and always and to this day as I share how it happens to any true servant of God it happens on a like daily basis
40:05
so every day I am truly strengthened in the Lord through you through these
40:12
testimonies through the honor so thank you thank you so much amen so um we got to we need to pull
40:21
upon the anointing we need to Value the anointing
40:26
and part of value in the anointing is showing just respect just give honor where honor is due share the
40:35
truth you know especially if you when you ever see that there's lies attacked towards the
40:42
anointing that's blessed you you you got to step up you have a responsibility to show honor what honor
40:49
is due know how powerful this is for the
40:55
the anointing for the servant of of God carrying the anointing that it's literally bringing
41:01
like protection to that anointing and it's it's leading to it to
41:07
be strong and the servant of God who carries the anointing to be strong so
41:13
you can be blessed more and more people can be reached
41:25
amen Psalms 3:3 but you oh Lord are a shield for me my glory and the one who
41:30
lifts up my head so one of the big ways that God lifts up the servant of God's
41:36
head who attacked who gets the the the brunt of the attacks of the devil is
41:41
through you through your edifying of honoring
41:48
amen so number three the power of honor
41:53
and this is um concerning honoring Servants of
41:59
God honor is needed for God's work to go
42:10
forth so AO Apostle Peter all right
42:15
Apostle Peter he carried powerful anointing and in the Bible it speaks it
42:21
speaks in the Bible that they that the people and those in that time would bring the sick and Demon possess
42:27
position themselves where the shadow of Peter would P would fall so in other
42:32
words they position themselves where the anointing was being released so the
42:38
anointing would touch them because God chooses to use
42:45
vessels to release his power God can do anything he wants he
42:50
can do Miracles any way he wants but the main way that God chooses to release his
42:57
power release Miracles deliver people heal people is through vessels this is
43:02
what we see from Old Testament to New Testament from to Moses Elijah Joshua
43:09
Elisha New Testament Paul Peter all the apostles all the disciples it's clear in
43:16
the word this is God's main way of releasing power re his power as anointing and
43:23
miracles Okay so there is a partnership
43:28
between the vessel and God you you can't separate them when it
43:34
comes to Miracles the power of God by and large amen simply because this is what
43:42
God has chosen to do this is his way he didn't have to choose it this way but he did we just know he chose it this
43:49
way amen so we see God anoint Peter
43:57
he carried this power of God this power of God wasn't fallen on like in the rain
44:03
it wasn't coming in the rain it is it do not say in the word of God they stepped outside and when the rain touched them
44:09
they were healed and delivered it it it doesn't say when they
44:16
went into their rooms by themselves and cried out then the miracle happened then the demon left it doesn't say it in the
44:22
word but it says that as apostle as the disciples prayed for people commanded
44:28
demons to go then they would go and the sick would be healed as they prayed for them it says that Apostle Paul they
44:35
would bring handkerchiefs and aprons to his body that carried the anointing so the anointing was then transferred to
44:40
the handkerchiefs and aprons and then it was placed on the sick and demon possessed and demons would flee and the sick would be
44:48
[Applause] healed it says that when people brought
44:53
the sick and demon possessed under the shadow of Apostle Peter when the shadow hit them they were healed and
45:00
freed these are our examples in the New Testament of how Miracles take place so
45:05
we know that this is God's main way of releasing his power of releasing his
45:11
miracles so it says in the word that people brought the sick and demon
45:16
possessed under Apostle Peter's Shadow how did they
45:22
know to come under Peter's shadow
45:27
people must have been speaking up people must have been saying I was
45:35
healed under Apostle Peter's Shadow I was delivered under Apostle
45:40
Peter's [Applause] Shadow honoring is a part of
45:50
testifying many people are not sharing the full testimony and therefore there's
45:55
not not there's there's not as much power in their testimony now especially in America and
46:03
the Western worlds most many in the body of Christ do not understand the power of Honor
46:11
they haven't had this teaching today probably and because they don't
46:17
understand the power of Honor it's it's just Fallen by the
46:22
wayside and then we find now that honor is like taboo in the body of Christ by
46:27
and large we don't see much honor or at least the proper honor that God's
46:32
talking about in the Western World in the American church we don't see much of
46:39
it and there's this wrong religious mindset that that if you honor a servant
46:45
of God you're you're it's seen as as glorifying the
46:52
person honor is different from glorifying to
46:58
glorify something or someone means to say you are the complete reason for
47:06
this and putting them on the same level as God or above
47:12
idolizing that's the meaning of glorifying but God actually instructs us
47:17
to honor people so we have to know that honor isn't glorifying because we're only
47:23
called to glorify God to give glory to God bringing glory that just means like
47:31
like when we give glory to God it just means God you have done this you and only
47:38
you though there were other part there was obedience involved by other people but the the person didn't bring the
47:45
miracle you're the only one that brought the miracle and this person could only do
47:52
this because of you this person only has breath in their lungs this person only has brain in their head heart in their
47:58
heart was only able to be transformed to be a vessel of God because of
48:03
you like that's glorifying that you're it's lifting God above everything else
48:09
saying you are above everyone every King every person you are the only
48:16
Lord you are the king of kings when we say glory to God when we give glory to
48:22
God that's the meaning of it amen but to honor as I shared in the beginning honor is just simply
48:29
acknowledging the truth acknowledging that a person did something good acknowledging that they were a blessing
48:35
acknowledging that that they were obedient so that God could then use them and they were a blessing that's the
48:41
meaning of Honor amen hallelujah but many in the body of
48:47
Christ in the Western World don't get that and when they they they see honor
48:52
they see it in the wrong eye they see it like you're glorifying a
48:59
person but that is wrong it is wrong so
49:04
anyways many people because of this wrong religious Doctrine this is old wine Doctrine this whole lack of Honor
49:11
thing wrong Twisted view of honoring because of that many people are afraid
49:17
to share the full testimony maybe they're afraid because they feel like I don't want to glorify a
49:23
person I want to make sure I give all the glory to God maybe they're like fearful of that or also and or they also
49:32
are afraid of what other people think will think because America and the Western world has such a problem with
49:38
honor the the the church does the body of Christ does they're afraid of what other people will
49:44
think also they might be afraid because they don't want to bring attack on themselves they don't want to associate
49:52
themselves with this powerful anointing and servant of God because because that means that that attack coming towards
49:57
that servant of God will transcend to them so for all of these reasons for
50:03
some of them one of them all of them it many times keeps people from sharing the full testimony but when you don't share
50:10
the full testimony you're not giving God actually all the honor and Glory that he deserves you're not you're not
50:17
acknowledging and being respectful to God's
50:23
ways it's like um like in the in the the body of Christ today like especially in the Western
50:30
World many people are ashamed of the Holy Spirit the move of the holy spirit that
50:38
makes demons tremble and cast out that brings manifestations like speaking in tongues falling back with
50:44
the power of God and so they will not talk about such
50:50
things they won't talk about baptism Holy Spirit they won't talk about demons demons being cast out it will not be
50:57
present in their sermons they will not even say the word demons in their sermon unless they're
51:04
maybe reading the scripture because they are
51:10
uncomfortable with this part of
51:18
God it's the same way when we testify some of you are like yeah that's
51:25
bad God because you love the Holy Spirit and you're you you you love that he
51:30
casts out demons you're not ashamed to say demons God delivered from demons God casts out Jesus casts out demons doesn't
51:38
scare you you're excited about it so some of you like you hear me
51:43
sharing this you're like oh yeah that's bad but some of you don't realize you're doing the same thing with your
51:52
testimony when you don't share the full testimony it's the same thing you're
51:58
leaving out part of God how he moves his ways which isn't giving him the full
52:05
glory and honor and is stopping the work of God to go forth as it could
52:10
have what I mean by this is let's say it was Peter you're in the
52:15
times of Peter and let's say that you uh are uncomfortable saying that you came
52:21
under Peter's Shadow and the anointing moved through Peter and you were healed and delivered probably because there's a
52:27
lot of hate coming towards him and you don't want to get that
52:32
attack and that religious spirit thinks it's weird and so let's say you're healed
52:39
you're delivered and let's say you testify you tell the whole world God healed me God freed
52:46
me freed me of this and this and this anxiety depression sickness
52:53
period but you don't share how God did it you don't share the the full truth of
53:02
it the Samaritan woman at the well she ran and told everybody about
53:08
Jesus but she didn't just leave it as God ambiguous God touched my life saved
53:16
me she told them the truth I met this man named
53:24
Jesus come and see come and receive as I have
53:31
received because if the Samaritan woman at the well just simply said God healed me God freed me it does a little bit it
53:38
increases faith in a person that God is moving moving today so it does a little bit but it does a small percentage of
53:46
what it could do if she just if you were to just share the whole story it what would happen when you just
53:53
say God healed me and that's it God deliver me and that's it but don't tell them how it happened where to go the
53:59
fact that anointing is in a Loca is at a location has a location like through
54:06
vessels that person's still lost that person's still bound that person goes in
54:11
their room cries out God heal me God deliver me you did it for that person why aren't you doing it for me night
54:17
after night night after night day after a day fasting praying God heal me deliver me this woman told me that you
54:24
healed her and delivered me why aren't you doing it because she didn't tell you
54:30
where to go find it where to go find the power of God how to be delivered and
54:35
healed there's a how it's serious when we don't share the
54:42
full story the full testimony of how we got delivered healed
54:48
transformed eyes opened this is serious guys people of
54:54
God right isn't that
55:00
serious so it's the same way today you have to share the whole
55:06
testimony this is how the work of God will go forth more so people can
55:12
know God is still healing God is still delivering he's still moving today and this is how I find him in power this is
55:20
where to go and then they come and then they receive and repeat they then share
55:25
their testimony their full testimony as they heard you share your full testimony you said a good example and then many
55:31
more people then they have faith and then they have Direction and then they come and receive and Revival spreads
55:38
across the whole [Applause]
55:44
world man if the whole body of Christ would stop being ashamed of parts of God
55:51
and parts of God's ways and told their whole testimony this world would look so
55:56
different right now and this is the this is why I'm bringing this message this is part of the new wine we must honor we
56:05
must be unashamed to honor to give honor what honors do to share our full
56:10
testimony if you can grab this word Body of Christ those of you watching those of
56:16
you if you can grab this word this revival will grow far and wide
56:24
the devil lies will not stand a
56:31
chance because people are seeking truth people are seeking for the most part
56:37
most people just want to know Jesus his love and be freed and healed there's some other people out
56:44
there with some bad Pharisee Hearts but that's not the majority people are just
56:51
SE searching for truth and so the devil devil uses his minions his
56:57
agents and they speak these these lies these false accusations Miracles they
57:03
aren't real this servant of God isn't real they speak all these things and the
57:08
people in the body of Christ that don't know the truth they're just seeking for truth and so they hear these loud voices
57:16
and they're not hearing many of the other voices the true Voices That should be speaking saying this is real this is
57:23
how my life has change let me show you evidence of my before and after let my
57:29
bring my husband or wife or friend to come here and testify I'm a witness she
57:34
was changed and saved delivered and healed after she encountered the power of God at blank
57:43
Ministry we are not speaking up enough telling the whole truth this is what
57:49
this is how Victory is coming this is how the wave of Revival is going to crash and we're going to be shocked we're going to be like what what
57:56
happened what happened how come people are now coming in the light how come
58:01
people are we're already seeing it happen and it's going to increase so much th this week it is increasing so
58:09
much that this wave of Revival is increasing mightily by that I mean so
58:15
many more people are coming out of Darkness they are recognizing that this is really Jesus
58:22
Jesus in this revival in his power and his anointing it's really him like
58:27
people are are are are recognizing it now and seeing the truth and are not believing the lies of the devil anymore
58:34
that are coming in their minds that are coming through other people speaking this religious garbage no this year is
58:41
the year of the Lord's great
58:49
acceptance but but how it's going to happen is when you catch the wave of Revival by by actually being obedient to
58:56
God by actually grabbing these words these words these words I'm
59:02
speaking there instructions and by you speaking up by
59:08
by those who have found the truth by speaking the truth un ashamedly and and if people will just
59:14
the truth outweighs the lies it outweighs the lies it absolutely
59:20
does but the truth has to be heard the truth has to be spoken
59:25
that's when the people that are lost right now the people that are blind the people that believe lies they will come into the light when you speak up more
59:33
for the truth to come louder than the lies
59:39
amen hallelujah so you need to have this Revelation when you're honoring giving
59:46
honor where honor is due by I mean really honor is pretty much just
59:51
testifying testifying whether your life or the body Body of Christ how a servant of God has blessed you how God's used
59:58
them to bless you how God's used them to do Miracles and everything how God's used you to help other people you're
1:00:03
just simply testifying is really what honor is through words at least you can testify through actions too but the big
1:00:10
part of honor is through words so have Revelation that you are doing powerful
1:00:16
things in the Kingdom you are making the work of God to
1:00:21
advance when you honor amen if people did not say if people
1:00:29
were afraid after being healed and delivered if five people were under Peter Shadow and were ashamed to go tell
1:00:34
others God healed me and delivered me when I went under Peter Shadow if if
1:00:40
nobody out of five people were to say that no one would have come only those
1:00:45
five would keep coming back but if five people told everyone
1:00:51
they knew then 1520 would come the next time and if 20 people told everyone they
1:00:56
knew the whole testimony giving honor honors due simply very simple if they
1:01:02
would do that then 30 40 50 would come if 50 that you see what this wave of
1:01:07
Revival is going to be if we can have re this Revelation and honor and speak up
1:01:13
and testify amen hallelujah
1:01:23
hallelujah
1:01:30
and and lastly um I shared this a little bit before but I just want to make this as its own
1:01:37
point of the power of honor and honoring Servants of God when you honor it's how
1:01:46
when you're honoring Servants of God it's how you give God the proper
1:01:53
honor because this is God's way of moving numbers 121 Miriam and Aaron began to talk
1:02:00
against Moses because of his kushite wife for he had married a kushite has the Lord spoken only through Moses they
1:02:07
asked hasn't he also spoken through us and the Lord heard
1:02:13
this now Moses was a very humble man more humble than anyone else on the face of the Earth at once the Lord said to
1:02:20
Moses Aaron and Miriam come out of the tent of meeting all three of you so the three of them went out then the
1:02:26
Lord went down in a pillar of a cloud and he stood at the entrance of the tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam when the two of them slept forward he said listen
1:02:33
to my words when there is a prophet among you I the Lord reveal myself to them in Visions I speak to them in dreams but this is not true of my
1:02:40
servant Moses he is faithful in all my house with him I speak face to face
1:02:47
clearly and not in riddles he sees the form of the Lord why then were you not
1:02:53
afraid to speak against my servant Moses the anger of the Lord burned against them and he left
1:03:00
them so let's rewind let's go back to verse two and it says uh what Mariam and Aaron were
1:03:08
saying was has the Lord spoken only through Moses hasn't he also spoken through
1:03:15
US was that that bad what they said God's acting
1:03:21
like they were saying he was the devil
1:03:26
God was acting as if what they were speaking against Moses was saying that he's like a false prophet he's from the
1:03:33
Devil he's evil or something you know what I mean like God was so upset at
1:03:42
them I I I just share this to show you how much God
1:03:48
respects his servants and how much God
1:03:55
doesn't like it when his servants aren't given honor and
1:04:00
respect so if God was so upset at at at at miam and Aaron for saying something
1:04:07
not that bad really doesn't that show how much God wants his servants to be
1:04:15
honored right so this is the thing as I shared
1:04:22
before God ch uses to use vessels it's just God's way it's a
1:04:29
teamwork thing and so this is why it's really important like God God himself
1:04:38
knows if I want to accomplish this I need my vessel to obey me to serve
1:04:45
me but then I also need my servant to be
1:04:50
respected accepted honored believed that I have sent him or her
1:04:58
that I am using him or her and the more that the fruits are
1:05:04
seen and spoken about and shared the more works I can do through them the
1:05:13
more works I can do you see you see how some so many times we separate God from
1:05:20
Servants of God but we can't do it the way way we are doing if we are serious
1:05:27
about pleasing God and wanting his work to go forth so it's really important for you
1:05:34
to see the love that God has for his servants it's really important for you
1:05:39
to renew your mind like when you honor a servant of God you're touching God's
1:05:44
heart like you're also honoring God and and especially I mean especially
1:05:53
when it's so hard for people to do this in these days with this Spirit of religion with the way that many people
1:05:59
don't understand honor this tremendously even more touches God's heart in this
1:06:06
season because he knows it was a sacrifice for you it was maybe difficult for you it
1:06:13
was uncomfortable for you maybe but you did it because of your love and obedience to
1:06:20
God Amen
1:06:35
so if you don't honor the anointing you cannot receive
1:06:44
it and this is why this is why to be a vessel of the anointing number one I as
1:06:51
I shared many times the number one requirement is surrender and
1:06:57
humility humility of the heart is what God is looking for to see if he can trust you with
1:07:03
anointing so as I shared in this message part of hum part of being humble is to
1:07:11
honor so God cannot give you anointing if you cannot be humble if you cannot do
1:07:17
all of the aspects of
1:07:22
humility now number two the anointing is purely for God's
1:07:29
work so if you don't want to adhere to how God moves in power does
1:07:36
his work if you don't want to accept and honor the fact that God uses
1:07:42
vessels what makes you think God's going to use you what makes you think God's going to release his anointing to
1:07:52
you the anointing is purely for God's work God use me I want to do your Mighty
1:07:58
works and heal and deliver people but the way God's work goes is through
1:08:04
vessels it doesn't make sense amen so God cannot release the anointing
1:08:11
if you don't honor honor Servants of God honor your where where you receiveing
1:08:17
impartation from equipping from your spiritual mother your spiritual father God cannot release the anointing to you
1:08:26
and lastly the anointing the Reason God gives you the anointing is to help people for people to help people to love
1:08:33
them heal deliver edify them so if you cannot be edifying people by
1:08:41
honoring then you will not Steward the anointing well you will misuse it you
1:08:46
will not be be using it to edify others so God cannot release the anointing to
1:08:52
you you cannot do every other principle except for Honor you cannot
1:08:59
sneak past God he
1:09:05
sees the anointing will not come if you are missing this
1:09:14
principle lastly I just want to share um that honoring
1:09:21
honoring a servant of God vessel of God is a beautiful thing that people do
1:09:27
and it's time that people stop bashing people for
1:09:34
honoring the heart behind honoring is
1:09:40
humility when you honor a servant of God through words and
1:09:45
action what's going the action of this is like of honoring them
1:09:51
is I recognize that God's way of releasing his power his anointing is
1:09:56
through a vessel and a vessel must be I mean this a vessel must be obedient for God to use
1:10:04
them I also know that there's a cost to the anointing I know there's sacrifice I
1:10:11
know there's so much refining fire I know there's so much persecution that comes against Servants of God who carry
1:10:16
the anointing so me I have been blessed I have been healed I have been delivered my life's been changed been brought
1:10:22
closer to Jesus Jesus fall more in love with Jesus known as love more because of
1:10:29
God moving specifically through this vessel so thank God for your
1:10:36
obedience because I know that that is was important was a requirement for me
1:10:43
to be blessed today for the anointing to move through you all of this obedience all that you went through that had to
1:10:49
happen you had to do that so I honor you I thank you
1:10:54
that's the meaning of honoring it's it's coming with a heart of humility and it's
1:10:59
also coming with this heart of I know all these attacks against this servant of God I will say the truth I want this
1:11:06
anointing to reach more people I want many more people to be blessed as I have been blessed so I
1:11:13
honor this anointing this servant of God God I want to give you the full
1:11:20
Glory by honoring I want to give you the prise proper honor God by honoring your servant that's the heart behi behind
1:11:28
someone who was honoring so if someone honors another if
1:11:33
someone honors a servant of God that's
1:11:38
honorable amen so it's time we give honor where honor is due in every way we
1:11:45
stop bashing others who are doing the beautiful thing that God is calling them to do
1:11:52
amen um I know that I remember when I went to Tanzania my spiritual father
1:12:00
Prophet Dr jvy his church the people there in that culture
1:12:06
in Africa they have different culture than us and sometimes in different cultures
1:12:13
God can bring about different Revelations not every Revelation is
1:12:19
released to just one country and one of the revelations that God has
1:12:26
really released or rather the people have really received they've actually received this Revelation from God in
1:12:33
specifically I've seen Africa just by my experience such as my spiritual father's church is this principle of honor
1:12:42
honor giving honor where honor is due and coming from America before I had
1:12:47
visited his church coming from America this was new I realized I haven't really seen honor but there I saw honor I saw
1:12:55
how they honored him and it was beautiful because I saw it was so pure there was no glorifying of any man of my
1:13:01
spiritual father it was pure Godly
1:13:07
honor and it was beautiful when I watched when I would see people honor I saw
1:13:13
wow they have their lives have really been changed and touched and blessed you can see it by how they honor and it
1:13:20
moved me it it it moved me to be more hum seeing how they honored it um it it
1:13:28
was even fruits to see The Godly honor was more fruits for me to even
1:13:33
see and be grateful that God brought me to be under
1:13:39
him as a spiritual daughter so their honor opened up my
1:13:46
eyes more amen um and
1:13:52
so I learned from that and I wanted to be humble I wanted to be honoring
1:13:57
too and so I would honor my spiritual father when I went to the church I would honor him and sometimes you can honor an
1:14:04
action in the culture of in Tanzania specifically and in many other cultures
1:14:10
too in spe especially in Africa the way of showing honor is to get on a knee to
1:14:16
bend down on a knee before the servant of God throughout the Bible we see many
1:14:24
examples of people doing the same thing before a servant of God and really it's just remember what what the Bible says
1:14:31
uh humble another person above you so God When God Says put another
1:14:38
person above you that's not glorifying so this is really when when people do this when people kneel down
1:14:45
before a servant of God this is an action of Honor because we can honor in words but God wants us to also action in
1:14:51
honor there's other ways to honor you can honor through sewing as well like
1:14:56
valuing giving honor what honor is do in that way too valuing what you have received that's another way through
1:15:02
action so in their culture and this is biblical we see it in the word of God
1:15:08
they get on in down on a knee as a a sign a showing a display of respect and
1:15:16
honor like I I humble myself you are above me
1:15:22
in the spiritual Realm for my good you know I am receiving impartation from you
1:15:27
I am receiving equipping from you I honor you amen and so you know in the Western
1:15:35
World people tend to see this as glorifying but it is not glorifying just because someone goes on a knee does not
1:15:40
mean they're giving glory to a person amen so I want to speak this you know I
1:15:49
I want to give honor where honor is due to the people at my spirit spiritual father's church and in every Church
1:15:55
where they do this where in their culture that is one of the ways of showing honor I want to honor
1:16:01
them and and you know because it it taught me how to be even more humble and
1:16:07
honoring amen hallelujah
1:16:13
hallelujah thank you Jesus and then I I myself have got on my
1:16:19
knee and honored my spiritual father but for me I was not giving any Glory to God
1:16:24
glory to him ever only glory to God I was only honoring amen and and I share this just just just
1:16:32
for you to know this truth this beautiful principle of honor and the different ways that people honor
1:16:38
Servants of God in different cultures so you can know so you shall know the truth and be set free there were one of the
1:16:46
schemes of the devil to like try to discredit me and call me false and
1:16:51
everything was to make make a video of showing me go on a knee before my spiritual father and portray it through
1:16:59
that religious lens Doctrine in in America and the Western World this is
1:17:05
glorifying a man and um I I don't regret anything I'm not I'm not ashamed to
1:17:12
honor my spiritual
1:17:19
father I I'm not I'm not ashamed I I am
1:17:24
I'm so grateful I'm so grateful for all that God has done through him for his
1:17:29
obedience I would not be where I am today I would not be carrying the
1:17:34
anointing I am today I would not have the spiritual food to release to you if
1:17:40
it was not for him for his obedience to God for what God did through
1:17:48
him and so I will give him honor however God wants me to give honor
1:17:54
in going to his church you know Paul says be like the culture so that they
1:17:59
can receive the Gospel message through you be like them so this is one of the ways this is how they show honor and
1:18:06
that's beautiful and good that's not the African way no this is how they show
1:18:12
honor and it's it's it's so prideful to be like well I'm American I don't want to do that I'm going to show honor in a
1:18:18
different way because I don't want people to think I'm weird and think wrong things about me no I will humble
1:18:25
myself and I will not put myself above them but I will honor them and their
1:18:33
culture by honoring just as how they honor honoring my spiritual father just as how they
1:18:40
honor amen hallelujah hallelujah praise God so
1:18:46
this is the power of honoring
1:18:51
amen hallelujah thank you Jesus so we will see this wave of Revival grow bigger and
1:18:59
bigger as we apply these powerful new wine principles of being obedient to God
1:19:06
of serving him of of applying these principles of doing what he's calling us to do so that his work of God can go
1:19:13
forth and we can have victory in the body of Christ over the devil amen woo
1:19:21
Hallelujah
