today you shall be delivered from the spirit of religion
0:06
[Applause]
0:12
Hallelujah so
0:18
there was a curse upon Humanity when Adam and Eve disobeyed God there
0:25
was a curse That Came Upon all humans and in this Cur this curse
0:33
kept Humanity from having direct access to God
0:39
from having revelation of his love and from being in real intimate
0:47
relationship with him and people were
0:53
born with not good heart not a good heart
0:58
people would sin and their lives would be bound by sin and there was no way to be free of the sin
1:05
this is part of what that curse was was that people Humanity was bound by sin
1:10
they couldn't be free from it and that also meant that they were
1:16
doomed like they could not be righteous they could not be in good standing with
1:22
God heaven was not in the future
1:28
because of this curse because of this sin that was constantly dwelling in people's lives
1:35
and God had this great plan for Humanity in
1:40
that time and for us today and for future generations and Pastor narrations
1:47
before us he had a great plan to save us from that curse
1:54
and the only way this could be done was by making a great sacrifice the greatest
2:00
sacrifice of all which was sending his only son Jesus Christ
2:05
to be a sacrifice for us to die for us
2:10
and that is what happened Jesus came he was crucified
2:16
his blood was shed and there was great power in that blood
2:23
before Jesus came they would be sacrificing animals to try
2:28
to cover up the sin but the sacrifice of the animals would help a little bit but
2:34
would only do a small make a small dent you could not the the people could not
2:39
be completely free of sin the sin would not be removed it would be there still just covered
2:46
but Jesus Paid the ultimate price and became the greatest sacrifice of all
2:52
and there was such power in that blood that it removed the curse that great
2:58
curse off of humanity for all who would come to believe that
3:05
Jesus is Lord that curse would be removed
3:11
Hallelujah Jesus removed the curse not only did he
3:17
remove that curse but it says that when he was crucified a veil was torn the
3:25
veil was torn amen now what is the veil well the Bible
3:34
talks about how God in those days would dwell
3:39
only in the temple and in the holiest of holies that's
3:44
where God would dwell and Humanity was so dirty and sinful
3:51
that they could not go to the holy of holies there was a veil literally a veil
3:58
physical and spiritual in that Temple that people that separated the holy of
4:04
holies from the rest of the temple and the people could not pass that Veil this is what I'm paraphrasing in the
4:10
Bible it speaks of this now a high priest was allowed was the
4:17
only one allowed to pass through that Veil once a year
4:22
and he would atone he would try to make atonement for the sins of all the people
4:28
of Israel that's what he was doing but only he and only once a year could he go
4:33
even into the holiest of holies which represents direct contact with God
4:41
intimacy with God with nobody in direct relationship
4:48
that's what that represents that's the holy of holies and so when Jesus is crucified the Bible
4:54
talks about that the veil was actually torn in the temple
5:01
signifying in this spiritual realm that that spiritual Veil that kept Humanity
5:07
that kept children of God away from him was torn
5:13
so now Hallelujah so now this is the gospel now whoever
5:23
believes that Jesus is Lord
5:29
that he is the savior of the world you can go directly to the holy of
5:35
holies meaning you can have direct access to God
5:41
intimacy relationship and continually with nobody in between no mediator
5:51
Hallelujah it actually says Hebrews 4 verse 14.
6:01
yeah thank you Jesus therefore since we have
6:07
a great high priest who has ascended into heaven Jesus the son of God
6:12
let us hold firmly to the faith we profess for we do not have a high priest who is
6:18
unable to empathize with our weaknesses but we have one who has been tempted in every way just as we are yet we did not
6:25
sin yet he did not sin let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence so
6:33
that we may receive mercy and find Grace to help us in our time of need
6:41
Hallelujah so Jesus actually became that high
6:47
priest that could was the only one that could come Jesus became the great high priest for us so now we don't need an Earthly
6:54
man an Earthly high priest to go to the holy of holies for us we can go directly
6:59
to the holy of holies we can go to God directly and have Intimacy in relationship with him
7:06
amen [Applause] Hallelujah
7:12
so God gave before Jesus came God gave
7:20
a law the law which was many Commandments there ended
7:25
up being 613 Commandments
7:30
that the people had to follow they were commanded to commanded to
7:37
follow this law perfectly 613 and that's when righteousness could come
7:44
but the thing is is that because of that curse that was impossible nobody was able to follow all of those
7:52
Commandments all the time it was impossible and so people they tried and they tried
8:00
and they tried to fulfill the law they made their life about fulfilling the law but they could never measure up
8:06
now God gave the law to reveal to people how sinful they were
8:15
he was preparing the way for Jesus to come Preparing People to realize how much we
8:23
need him how we cannot be righteous without him
8:30
so this law he gave to show us to show people
8:35
I'm sinful and I need Jesus I Need A Savior Hallelujah
8:43
he uh Galatians 3 verse 19.
8:50
why then was the law given it was this is the passion translation
8:56
it was meant to be an intermediary agreement added after God gave the
9:01
promise of the coming one it was given to show men how guilty they
9:07
are and it remained enforced until the seed was born to fulfill the promises given
9:14
to Abraham until Jesus was born when God gave the law he didn't give it to them directly for he gave it first to
9:21
the angels they gave it to Moses he's and gave it to the people now a mediator does not represent just
9:27
one party alone but God fulfilled it all by himself since that's true should we consider the
9:34
written law to be contrary to the promise of New Life how absurd truly if there was a law that
9:41
we could keep which would give us new life then our Salvation would have come
9:46
by law keeping but the scriptures make it clear that since we were all under the power of sin
9:54
we needed Jesus and he is the savior who brings the
9:59
promise to those who believe amen
10:08
so this is Galatians chapter three I just read 19 and we're going to go
10:14
backwards now to verse 1. I'm going to read a lot of scripture here because it's very important for you to be
10:20
delivered of the spirit of religion you need to understand really what religion is and what the spirit of religion is
10:28
so then you can identify it in your life and realize this is not of God this thing that I thought was of God this
10:35
thing that I thought was right is actually a demonic Spirit of religion
10:42
amen so we are reading a lot of scripture today in order for you to have
10:48
this understanding in order for you to really understand what this Spirit of religion is there's
10:54
a lot of people that talk about oh religion all religion and people I think get confused and also don't have full
10:59
understanding of what this means so you shall know the truth today and you shall be free amen
11:08
you shall not perish because of lack of knowledge you shall know this knowledge amen hallelujah so Galatians 3 verse 1
11:18
this is Passion translation so Paul right now okay he is speaking to the
11:24
Galatians which is he's speaking to a church to a specific church and he's correcting them
11:30
he's correcting them because they were living religiously they were living
11:36
being influenced by the spirit of religion they had already been introduced to Jesus given their lives to
11:44
Jesus they already have heard the word of God coming through Paul and others
11:51
proclaiming to them the gospel and teaching them what I just shared with you about how we shouldn't we the curse
12:00
of the law is broken and we do not become righteous we do not become saved
12:05
by works that we do but by faith in Jesus by his grace and
12:11
by faith in him so he ends up correcting these guys because though they've already been
12:17
taught this though they should know better they are going backwards they are
12:23
letting the spirit of religion have influence on their lives and how they are living and they are begin to not
12:29
live by the spirit but they're going backwards rather than
12:35
they're they're supposed to leave it behind the religion that they once were in but they've grabbed it backwards and
12:42
are pulling it now in their in their new life so he starts to say what has happened to
12:48
you Galatians to be acting so foolishly he's bringing correction
12:53
you must have been under some evil spell didn't God open your eyes to see the
12:59
meaning of Jesus's crucifixion wasn't he revealed to you as the crucified one
13:05
so answer me this did the Holy Spirit come to you as a reward for keeping all the Jewish laws
13:12
no you received him as a gift because you believed in the Messiah your new
13:19
life in the anointed one began with the Holy Spirit giving you a new birth
13:25
why then would you so foolishly turn from living in the spirit by trying to
13:33
finish by your own works have you endured all these trials and persecutions for nothing let me ask you
13:40
again what does the lavish supply of the holy spirit in your life and the Miracles of God's tremendous power have
13:46
to do with you keeping religious laws the holy spirit is poured out upon us
13:53
through the Revelation and power of faith not by keeping the law
14:02
that's how the Holy Spirit comes upon you that's how more of the Holy Spirit
14:07
comes upon you that's how the anointing comes in your life that's how you're
14:13
able to live so by the spirit and be transformed by the spirit
14:18
is by the Revelation and power of your faith not by keeping the law
14:28
so Abraham our father of Faith led the way is our pioneering example
14:34
he believed God in the substance of his faith released God's righteousness to him so those who are the true children of
14:41
Abraham will have the same Faith as their father God's plan all along was to bring this
14:46
message of Salvation to the Nations through the revelation of faith long ago God prophesied over Abraham as
14:54
the holy scriptures say through your example of faith all the nations will be blessed
15:00
and so the blessing of Abraham's faith is now our blessing too now Abraham
15:07
Abraham and others like Elijah and Elisha and Moses and Joshua they are these people
15:15
who were given a supernatural Grace because the curse was upon all of
15:21
humanity which made it so hard to
15:26
live how God wanted you to live to live by faith it made it so difficult
15:33
but God gave this Supernatural Grace upon these people upon these Servants of
15:39
God upon Abraham Elijah Elisha Moses
15:44
and now we can have this great example of faith amen
15:53
so it says he says to the Galatians but if you choose to live in bondage under
15:59
the legalistic rule of religion you live under the Law's curse
16:08
let me say that again he's saying this to to church people he's saying this to a church to Christians he's speaking to
16:15
them if you choose to live in bondage under the legalistic rule of religion
16:22
you live under the Law's curse so he's saying you're living as if Jesus didn't
16:28
come you're living just like those who were under the curse before Jesus came
16:35
Christians have that choice and he's correcting them he's speaking to them don't choose this way
16:42
for it is clearly written utterly cursed is everyone who fails to practice every detail and requirement
16:49
that is written in this law for the scriptures reveal and it is obvious that no one achieves the
16:55
righteousness of God by attempting to keep the law for it is written those who have been made holy will live by faith
17:04
but keeping the law does not require faith but self-effort
17:11
for the law teaches if you practice the principles of law you must follow all of them yet Christ paid the full price to
17:18
set us free from the curse of the law he absorbed it completely as he became a
17:23
curse in our place for it is written everyone who is hung upon a tree is doubly cursed so Jesus
17:30
was hung on a tree meaning the cross so he fulfilled that scripture he became the curse for us
17:37
for Jesus our Messiah was cursed in our place and in so doing dissolved the curse from our lives
17:43
so that all the blessings of Abraham can be poured out upon even non-jewish believers
17:49
basically meaning everybody from every tribe and tongue Every Nation with
17:55
whatever background they had this they can receive these Blessings Now they can receive this salvation
18:01
and now God gives us the promise of the wonderful Holy Spirit who lives within us when we believe in him
18:10
amen [Applause]
18:17
Hallelujah so
18:24
the Bible says when you seek me with all your heart then you will find me the Lord when you seek the Lord with all of
18:31
your heart then you will find him that's the principle of finding Jesus
18:37
of meeting Jesus not just hearing about him but having a real encounter with him
18:44
and which means that your eyes then open up to see who he really is
18:50
that is when you can have true revelation of his amazing love for you
18:57
and his mercy and his grace
19:03
and his compassion for you and his understanding that he has for he he was tested and
19:10
tempted you know fully manfully God as it says our our high priest
19:16
sympathizes with us for he endured this is what I read the first scripture I read
19:23
Hebrews 4 14 we do not have a high priest Jesus Jesus is not unable to
19:28
empathize with our weaknesses it's saying but we have one who has been tempted in
19:34
every way just as we are yet he did not sin let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence so that we may
19:39
receive mercy and find Grace to help us in our time of need so when you actually encounter Jesus meet
19:46
him really meet him not just hear about him your eyes will open up to his love
19:52
his compassion his Mercy his grace and when this happens you cannot help but
19:58
fall in love with him Hallelujah
20:04
and and it's just like it's just like marriage like when you fall in love with
20:10
somebody you you have to marry them like you you can't imagine life without them
20:16
it just happens when you really fall in love you you give your life
20:21
to be married right and you put the other person first you make sacrifices
20:27
right so with when you really meet Jesus he's so irresistible his love is so
20:32
amazing when you actually meet him that you can't help but give your life
20:39
to him amen so but but the big problem is that
20:46
a lot of people don't seek God enough a lot of people get content with their
20:54
Christian lives their current Christian lives which actually have a lot of religion in them
21:02
and they don't seek so they don't find
21:08
a lot of people don't really have revelation of God's amazing love for them
21:14
and at the same time they become complacent and they end up living one
21:19
foot in the world because only God can give true contentment and fulfillment
21:27
when you have revelation of his love and you become in relationship with him and you surrender that's when contentment
21:34
and fulfillment comes only then so there's a lot of Christians that have
21:41
never really met Jesus have never encountered him in power Paul says I didn't come to you with wise
21:48
and persuasive words but I came to you with a demonstration of the power of God so that your faith
21:53
wouldn't rest on my word for it but your faith would rest on God's power
21:59
meaning he really carried the anointing he released the anointing and the power of
22:06
God and this power of God touched people it it made it so people were actually
22:12
meeting Jesus he was tangible their spiritual eyes opened up there's a lot of people that
22:18
are not seeking the fullness of God they are not seeking where he's moving
22:24
in power and so they end up never meeting him I was a Christian my whole life my
22:30
earliest memory was age four giving my life to Jesus I mean saying the sinner's prayer with my parents in the living
22:36
room I never knew a day without faith in God I never knew a day not loving God
22:43
but I grew up not knowing the power of the Holy Spirit
22:49
I grew up never encountering the power of God and so looking back I realized I never
22:56
really met Jesus in those years in my childhood in middle
23:02
school and high school I loved him I had faith in him but I never actually met
23:08
him like tangibly um and until when I've as soon as I
23:13
moved to LA this was prophetic because this is this was uh when God brought me out here I mean he he brought me out
23:21
here for to what we see today for for my purpose to be fulfilled for his promises of this
23:30
revival and faithful Church like he brought me to L.A that was the reason so
23:35
it was very prophetic that as soon as I moved to LA in 2013
23:41
immediately I felt God pursuing me in my spirit like because that's what God do
23:47
does he plants seeds and then it's he plants he pursues he he he starts to put
23:55
a little hunger in you to seek him out to find the more of him through various
24:02
ways can be through other people it could be just like in your spirit you just feel like I want to check out a
24:08
church like you know you just he pursues but it's up to us to respond that's
24:15
where a lot of people fail they're too complacent and too happy with their one foot in the world life
24:22
but I responded to the call I felt this
24:27
Pursuit from God where all of a sudden I just felt hungry the moment I moved to LA
24:33
I felt hungry to find more of him there was this burden in me like there's more of him I hadn't found yet and I want to
24:40
find him so that led me to be open-hearted it led me to be humble like
24:45
there's a lot I don't know about God I know this and so I'm open to find him rather than yeah I know it all I've been
24:52
a Christian my whole life I'm going to be teaching now I should be leading a Bible study because I know so much it was the opposite of that it was his
25:00
conviction there's so much more of him that I haven't found yet so that led me to be humble and open-hearted and
25:06
teachable and ready ripe ripe in the spiritual realm for God to reveal
25:13
himself to me so this hunger led me to go to new
25:20
places that I never had before and encounter God in power I witness
25:25
miracles happen for the first time in my mid-20s I witnessed people be healed and
25:30
demons manifest and cast out that's the first time I I even I even saw demons tremble I didn't know they existed today
25:37
until that moment and I've encountered prophetic Ministry which opened up my eyes to God's
25:44
intimate love for me and his closeness and that he he really knows me and he's
25:49
always with me and the love I encountered through the prophetic Ministry revealed to me that he wasn't
25:56
judgmental and condemning because out of all the things that he could have said to me
26:02
he spoke such love and it was really his Spirit through the
26:07
prophetic Ministry really his anointing so it touches you more than just a person saying God loves you
26:14
but when it's the anointing the power of God through a prophetic word it's it's that moment where you meet God where he
26:21
becomes tangible so close not just hearing God loves you and you
26:27
feel like he's far away yeah but God's saying to you I love you so much I'm
26:32
proud of you I adore you I truly love you more than any person can love you in
26:39
this world I love you as if you're the only person in this world
26:44
that's what happened to me when I first encountered God's power and I fell in love with him
26:49
and I surrendered everything I couldn't help but surrender that's all I wanted to do that's all I wanted to do thank
26:57
you Jesus I was sharing with you how I encountered God's power in my mid-20s
27:02
and my eyes opened up to God's Amazing Love and I really met him and it felt like it
27:09
felt like in a spiritual realm he was looking at me with such eyes of love and
27:14
passion and and and his love was so overwhelming that it's like he didn't even see bad
27:22
parts of me you know he he focused on the Beauty and
27:27
the good that he had created and the plans that he had for my life and the
27:33
good parts of my heart that I hadn't really seen and he was proud of that and
27:38
he was adoring that it's like that's why that's how it felt like when I encountered God in power and when I met
27:44
him and so prior to that day prior to that day I grew up in a middle school high school
27:52
and I did not know how to have a relationship with God I just knew to
27:57
pray a prayer at night and it was usually the same repetitive prayer praying for certain family members and
28:04
now I lay my head down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep keep me safely through the night wake me with the Morning Light every single night
28:11
I would just say that and I knew I was supposed to read my Bible but I just
28:17
ended up not reading the Bible through uh like high school then I started to
28:24
put one foot in the world and I started to be lukewarm and I did not have revelation of the importance of
28:31
following God's word I didn't have Revelation that his word was given to us
28:38
so that we can find true life so that we can be protected from doors opened of
28:43
demons coming in I did not have that Revelation and I would go to church
28:49
every week and I loved God but I wasn't in love with him because I hadn't met
28:54
him yet because you can't be in love with anybody if you haven't really met him
28:59
so that was my life and then I went to college and I I still loved God I I
29:05
loved to talk about him it was my favorite thing to do but I had worldly friends I had one foot in the world I
29:12
would go to um like bars but I wouldn't get really drunk and I wouldn't sleep with people
29:19
but I was living lukewarm one foot in one for out I would lead
29:25
um I would lead the worship Services I would sing Worship in college but living
29:30
lukewarm and I would have my Bible on the the nightstand and it would sit there every day and I knew I was
29:38
supposed to read it but something kept me from reading it and I never opened it up and I didn't spend intimate time
29:45
praying to God throughout the day and and in return I would feel so much
29:53
condemnation I would feel like man I am
29:58
a horrible Christian what is wrong with me why can't I open up the Bible I'm not doing good enough I what what's wrong
30:06
with me that's how I lived I lived in condemnation I lived more thinking about condemnation from God than his love for
30:13
me and then everything changed when I
30:20
really met Jesus by his power moving through vessels
30:25
everything changed so before I didn't know Jesus was this
30:31
loving towards me that his love engulfed any sin in my life any bad parts of my
30:40
life I didn't know that his love engulfed it all like a consuming fire
30:47
I didn't know that God saw such beauty in me until that moment but then when I
30:53
met him I I could see God your love is so
30:59
and and in that moment it's it's like what happened in the spiritual realm is like
31:06
oh I had this picture of who Jesus was like I it wasn't love like this first of
31:12
all but it was like condemning and judgmental and it made me not want to come near to
31:19
him like because I was seeing him as you're not Measuring Up it made me like embarrassed like try to
31:28
just ignore it and just go about my life and never actually open my bible talk to him come to him
31:34
shame and that's what happened with Adam and Eve
31:41
Adam and Eve made a mistake but they were I mean God loved them so much but
31:47
they made that mistake and they immediately heard the Devil speaking
31:53
condemnation and judgment pretending to be the voice of God
31:59
disguised trying to disguise himself as the voice of God like you should be ashamed of yourselves you are gross your
32:06
naked body is gross you need to cover up that's what they were hearing and they
32:12
never knew they were naked before they were the first humans so they didn't have a concept of like I'm I'm good
32:17
weird they didn't have that concept but because the devil is speaking this you
32:23
are dirty God like pretending to be God's voice you are dirty I'm so
32:28
disappointed with you run away and hide because I'm so angry I don't even want to see you I'm not loving you right now
32:35
I'm mad at you right now so go away and cover yourselves like that's what the
32:40
devil was speaking to them trying uh this pretending to be God
32:45
and they believed it was God so they went and covered themselves and then God goes where are you why are you hiding
32:53
and then he sees them covering he's like who told you you were naked who told you you were dirty it wasn't me
33:01
who told you you should cover up because because they didn't want to see you it wasn't me
33:10
this is the spirit of religion there's a lot of the spirit of religion we're just going to get to a part of it
33:16
today there's going to be another part next week but this is part of it
33:22
part of the spirit of religion is condemnation and judgment
33:29
the condemnation and judgment that was upon Humanity that Humanity dealt with all the time they were judged they were
33:36
simple they couldn't be free of it but now we are free from sin through Jesus
33:42
[Applause] and when and when we make a mistake if
33:50
we can simply turn to Jesus through faith and receive his grace boldly come
33:55
to his throne he removes the sin immediately instead of judging us he removes it
34:04
instead of saying ew you're ugly you're dirty he wipes it immediately
34:11
so he doesn't even have a second of condemning you shaming you that's why it says therefore there there is no longer
34:18
there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus
34:24
for those who believe that Jesus is their lord and those who act like Jesus is Lord
34:31
those who know Jesus is Love so that when they do make a mistake they immediately turn to Jesus
34:39
in Repentance repentance means to turn they turn to Jesus repentance turn from
34:45
your old ways don't stay there don't stay in shame and in that place but turn
34:51
and when you turn to Jesus because you've repented this is this is
34:57
the gospel when we repent he forgives us he wipes away the sin you're completely
35:02
clean Hallelujah and
35:08
and when you turn to Jesus you access his spirit
35:15
when you look to Jesus that's how you're transformed
35:20
that's how you receive his Spirit to transform you Hallelujah
35:38
I don't think I put the scripture down so I'm going to just paraphrase it to you I meant to write it down but
35:44
um there's a scripture that says when we look to Jesus we we are being
35:51
transformed continually continually we are being transformed when we look to Jesus when we put our
36:00
eyes when we turn to him when we make a mistake and we immediately turn when we
36:06
make a say a mistake and we're like I didn't want to do this I want to live to
36:11
please Jesus the only way I can make this be removed from me and have
36:18
the ability to not do that again is if I turn to Jesus so I Turn to You Jesus in
36:24
my as I'm naked and I let you wipe away that sin
36:29
and I now am receiving your spirit upon my life pouring upon my life when you receive
36:36
his Spirit that's when the transformation comes so you are transformed more into His
36:42
Image so he take he pushes down the flesh Tendencies The Temptations of the
36:48
flesh he pushes it away when there is bondage when there are demons that are forcing you to sin you don't even want
36:55
to be sinning but you have demons you have Yokes you turn to him you seek Him
37:00
you seek his power and that's when when you seek him like when you come position yourself where
37:06
the anointing is you're seeking him and it's as simple as that you receive the anointing to free you so you come in
37:13
here with demons forcing you to sin controlling you possessed they're
37:19
possessing you to sin like when you when you don't want to be drinking and doing drugs all the time but there's a force
37:25
within you that's like possessing you controlling you but you come here you come position yourself where God's
37:31
moving in power you seek God's face you position yourself to receive his spirit and then his Spirit his anointing his
37:39
power destroys the Yoke makes the demon to go and you leave and he fills you with his Spirit more of his spirit and
37:46
you leave this place the Temptation is gone and you find you have this hunger to please him to live for him
37:55
that's what happens when we turn to Jesus and when we keep turning to Jesus living
38:03
every day turning to Jesus then he will not make it hard for you to
38:09
live a Pure Life it's not hard to
38:14
say no to the spirit of religion telling you to run from Jesus and cover yourself
38:19
and be shameful and instead turn to Jesus all you have to do is nakedly turn
38:26
to Jesus and it's not hard to live a Pure Life
38:32
hallelujah hallelujah [Applause]
38:37
so when when I met Jesus and I surrendered to him
38:44
I left that place in love I mean I left where I encountered God in power in that Revelation where I surrendered where I
38:50
surrendered to God I left I left there in love
38:56
a smile on my face all the time because my eyes could now see Jesus's love for
39:01
me and that he was really with me all the time and in that same moment when I met Jesus
39:07
I knew this perception I had of him before was so wrong he is not condemning he is not
39:13
judgmental and so all of a sudden I had this passion to to seek him to be with him to
39:20
spend time with him that I didn't have before because now I was seeing him rightly
39:26
his amazing love not the judgment and condemnation and so I started reading
39:32
the word of God all the time I started spending time with him saying no to hanging out with friends I was doing all
39:38
these social activities all the time with church friends and stuff but I I was I was putting God first for the
39:45
first time in my life in terms of intimacy relationship reading his word and praying and spending time with him
39:51
and I loved it I was what I wanted to do more than anything when the day prior
39:58
and so many years prior I could not do it because I was bound by the spirit of
40:03
religion I was blinded by the spirit of religion and god Set Me Free by by opening my
40:10
eyes to his love by encountering his power and I was free from that day completely
40:16
free Hallelujah [Applause]
40:22
and so my whole life changed from there that Revelation changed everything where anytime the devil was trying to condemn
40:30
me about anything I knew this is the devil when before I
40:35
didn't know it was the devil I thought it was God I would believe it and it would make me feel down
40:41
and it would push me farther away from God but now I hear these voices and I reject
40:49
them I would hear these voices and I would reject them and I would instead turn to Jesus and see him rightly
40:55
continue to see him rightly every day Hallelujah
41:02
[Applause] and so um
41:08
what happens is so so what happens is number one the spirit of religion brings
41:15
judgment number two the spirit of religion says
41:21
it's about what you do your performance and number three uh also this the spirit
41:30
of religion repels you from God
41:37
repels you from God first of all the spirit of religion that's its aim to try to keep you to try to do it he did
41:44
accomplished what he did with Adam and Eve to try to keep you keeping on turning away from God when you're
41:50
supposed to turn to him that's the spirit of religion's aim the spirit of religion knows that you
41:56
will actually be now living Bound by the law uh you you're not turning to Jesus to
42:03
receive his spirit so you you keep on thinking that because you're not reading the Bible enough
42:09
because you're not praying enough because you're not doing this thing and this thing and this thing and this thing
42:16
enough then God is is disappointed in you
42:22
and you're not a good Christian so the spirit of religion is coming
42:27
number one with this voice of it's about your works
42:33
it's about your performance because you're not doing good enough God is
42:38
disappointed so that's the voice you hear every day when really the truth is
42:44
God is saying I love you I'm proud of you I'm excited for your future for the
42:50
promises that will be fulfilled in your life the plans I have for you that we
42:56
will do together God is full of joy he's full of great love for you
43:04
the scripture there's a scripture that says in Psalms that the paraphrasing it that
43:11
how a father loves his child is just the tiniest glimpse of God's love for you so every day he's
43:19
I love you but but when you are listening to the spirit of religion you think he's
43:26
literally every day saying I'm disappointed in you
43:31
I'm ashamed so I don't even want to speak with you go away and punish yourself
43:39
with the condemnation and so what happens is
43:45
that I told you that fulfillment can only come through Jesus when you're looking to him and having true
43:50
revelation of him and and and when you have that fulfillment you don't need anything else of the
43:56
world you don't want anything else from the world Amen and when you're constantly looking to
44:02
him his spirit is transforming you so you want to please him so much that becomes your biggest passion just
44:09
naturally when you seek him and so now you're literally living to
44:14
please him every day and as you're doing that doors are shut to the devil as you're doing that you are living in his
44:22
will you are doing powerful things for the kingdom and you're living the Abundant Life that
44:27
he has given us on the cross you're accessing that but when you're when you're listening to
44:34
the spirit of religion you do not have the revelation of God's love so you're not having that
44:39
contentment you're not looking to his spirit so he's not able to give you that contentment you need
44:45
you're hearing that he is ashamed of you so you're turning farther away from him and so therefore when there is not
44:51
contentment you seek other places to fill you contentment and so it's this repelling from God more
44:58
and more that takes place it can end up sending people to hell
45:04
that claim themselves to be Christians because they're they're actually living
45:09
far from God they're walking farther and farther away from God in their hearts and in their
45:15
actions to try to fulfill themselves
45:21
so this is the the real danger of the spirit of religion this is why the the this is the devil's one of his biggest
45:30
schemes is to Blind the church is to Blind
45:35
Believers with the spirit of religion he he tries to send people to hell with
45:43
this spirit this is his biggest schemes
45:48
and we've been learning so much about this about the old wine skin lately
45:55
the old wine skin is is that old way of thinking is that under the law of thinking is that
46:03
perception of the word of God and not having revelation of God's grace
46:08
and that things really change so much so you have to read the Bible
46:14
according to the New Covenant from Old Testament into the New Testament you need to read the word of
46:20
God according to the New Covenant not in this old wine skin way
46:28
and this is the big thing that God is doing right now in this revival there's so many Christians plagued in bondage
46:35
with the spirit of religion and now God is freeing his people he's
46:40
opening up eyes to who he really is
46:46
to really his love and his grace and so I want to share with you how to
46:54
identify this Spirit of religion coming through judgment coming through
47:01
why Works The Works mentality in your life how you might see it take
47:07
place so God understands that we are human
47:16
God understands we get tired we need sleep God understands you have kids
47:24
they come with a lot of needs God understands that things come up
47:29
that we have an enemy the devil that brings random attacks God understands all of these things that
47:35
can sometimes make it so all these things come up in our on our day and
47:40
what we had planned to do in terms of spending time with God like reading in his word
47:45
and setting aside time with him sometimes things come up
47:50
and we can't spend as much time as we had set out to do as we had planned
47:56
or maybe not at all in terms of reading the word maybe maybe so many things happened maybe it was God asking you to
48:03
do things for his kingdom he had serious things he wanted you to do and even that on that particular day that's what he
48:09
was calling you to do and that's even where intimacy with him would would be in through obeying him
48:16
and through doing the work so God understands this so we shouldn't live our lives in this religious ritualistic
48:24
way of like I must read one chapter of the
48:30
Bible at least or God's disappointed with me a day
48:36
I must pray for one hour at least in my room
48:42
or God's disappointed with me and some of you have been living that way some of you it has been taught to you
48:49
this and people in your lives have said yeah this is what I do I pray this my fastest
48:54
man I read the Bible this is what we have to do and it's been this wrong religious
49:02
revelation of who God is that's come deeply in your life
49:07
and with that you you think when I read the Bible when I pray when I fast when I
49:14
do this and this and this then I can feel good about myself then God is is
49:19
good with me then I know I'm a good Christian and I can okay
49:26
and you're living your life like that
49:31
which is completely Works based and forgetting all of God's grace and forgetting about intimacy with God
49:39
forgetting that it's about relationship it should be about God what
49:45
do you want me to do today how do you want me to spend time with you how do you want me to read your word how much
49:51
of the word should I read today and then and then understanding that the
49:56
holy spirit moves like the wind and it it doesn't stay the same every day in terms of like do this every day
50:03
sometimes things come up and so if things come up and the usual habit you
50:08
have habits are good habits are good like planning to read the Bible certain time a day and a certain amount that's
50:14
good because if you don't do that you can end up putting it not first place last place things take over you know but
50:21
if the date comes and things happened and maybe it was God leading you to do a
50:27
lot of things for him maybe it was the devil came with all these attacks maybe it was just you have kids
50:32
whatever it was and if the day passes and all of a sudden you fell asleep before reading the three
50:40
chapters of the Bible you would plan to do that day and and you fall asleep you don't wake up in the morning being like
50:45
Oh God is so disappointed you wake up in the morning being like Oh the Holy
50:52
Spirit moved in a different way yesterday but you wake up good morning Lord and
50:58
you see God's looking you good morning my child I love you
51:04
[Applause]
51:10
and so you need to live your days constantly Renewing Your Mind with the Revelation that God has shown you of his
51:16
love I know many of you have had encounters like I had and you know what I'm talking about how everything changed and you
51:23
know he's not this condemning God he's such an amazing his love his grace this is who he is and if you haven't had that
51:30
you'll have it today in Jesus name if you will have faith if you have hunger
51:38
and so you should live your day constantly Renewing Your Mind of how God
51:44
is looking at you that he's looking at you with love constantly Renewing Your Mind of this Spirit of religion that
51:50
you've had to deal with in your life and that the devil will probably try to come back in this way so be aware you should live your days aware in the
51:57
spiritual realm of these attacks so then when a condemning thought comes you can catch it immediately reject it and turn
52:04
to Jesus and not be affected by that Spirit of religion trying to repel you from God
52:11
and so you should this is how you should live your days Renewing Your Mind with this truth constantly seeing God rightly
52:18
rejecting the devil's lives of condemnation and living with the Revelation that God
52:24
is on your side that he's cheering you on that he isn't making it hard to follow
52:31
him to obey him that he's on your side he's a help you
52:37
and that it's his plans not your religious plans that should be happening
52:42
today on this day so you should come humbly Lord lead me this day I want to be in your will
52:48
perfectly I want to spend time with you perfectly and you live in friendship with God
52:56
throughout your day the religious spirit that's about performance also tends to think that
53:03
um just the action of Prayer is making God happy with you
53:10
and they speak religious sounding prayers because because it's about Works they think the more
53:17
um I don't know spiritual it sounds the more the better a Christian you are
53:23
the more powerful your prayers are so people will say prayers and they'll say
53:28
they'll start speaking in this religious language that they don't speak on they don't speak that's not how you naturally
53:34
speak but you you speak in this foreign language you start speaking in New King
53:40
James Version language or King James version not New King James Version language
53:48
you start saying Dolph and shall and thou
53:57
no father who art in heaven and said you should be praying with revelation
54:04
Hallowed be thy name Lord here in Heaven and Earth in my life I
54:10
praise you do you know what Hollywood means are you just saying it
54:18
your name is great and worthy to be praised Lord I praise you you're so good
54:23
you protected me today I saw I saw the enemy's attack on my life and you
54:29
protected me today Hollow would be your name like I Praise
54:34
You Lord for how good you are you're praying with Revelation you're praying as if God is
54:40
right before you and he's a real person not this God who doesn't speak the same
54:47
language as you that only speaks a new King James version you don't really understand what he's saying or King James version and you don't really
54:52
understand what he's saying and he's far away but you speak to him
54:59
as if he's your best friend that he is in this world and you speak to him in normal language with from the heart
55:06
your kingdom come your will be done God I want your will to be done in my
55:11
life today I want your kingdom to come to through me I want your your will to be done I don't I give my will to you
55:18
today God I want to be led perfectly by your spirit God I want your will in my life
55:26
I want to see the anointing flow through my life I want your kingdom to come I want the anointing to come and make me a
55:33
vessel you can trust Lord Give Me a Heart you can trust so you can pour your anointing through me and so I can actually do real things for you powerful
55:40
things for you on this Earth
55:47
Hallelujah give us this day our daily bread
55:52
thank you Jesus for providing for me you have given me everything I need I believe this I don't know how I'm going
55:59
to pay the bills next week but I know you're going to provide and I ask you for that provision and and I declare all
56:07
the all the ways the devil's trying to get in the way of me having that provision it must be gone I thank you
56:12
Lord for providing for me I've seen how you provided for me in my life so many times I thank you Lord
56:20
and forgive us our trespasses some of you don't know what trespasses mean sins
56:26
you're just saying it God yesterday
56:32
I lashed out at somebody I want to have more of your heart thank you for giving thank you for forgiving
56:38
me Lord I Repent I Turn to You and I apologize
56:45
amen forgive us our trespasses forgive those who have trespassed against us
56:51
Lord I love my enemies this person was attacking me today and talking to me
56:57
yesterday was speaking bad things to me but I forgive them and I bless them I
57:02
want them to be blessed not cursed amen
57:10
from that is the kingdom the power and the glory forever you I think you learned for victory
57:18
that your power has victory over my over every yoke in scheme of the devil in my
57:24
life for that is the power and the kingdom and the glory forever be
57:30
glorified God be glorified in my life today Hallelujah
57:38
thank you Jesus [Applause] so there's just a little example for you
57:46
I'm not saying don't say the Lord's Prayer I just gave you that example of how people are praying just because I'm
57:53
supposed to pray and you say even fancy words I pray for three hours I'm a great Christian now
58:01
but you're far from God you're far from God and you're not even that's not even
58:06
bringing you righteousness it's you're not accessing the grace so you're not even saved if that's how
58:13
you're living you need to have real Intimacy in
58:19
relationship with God pray to him with your heart yes set
58:25
aside time for God to pray with him but let it be real intimacy and sometimes that might mean only 10 minutes or five
58:32
minutes but throughout the rest of the day you're still talking to him as a friend
58:37
you're still including him in your days throughout a friend as a friend and so as you do this this is how you're
58:44
accessing his spirit this is how you're able to live by the spirit
58:50
and so Hallelujah so doing Works religiously
58:57
um is is is to make yourself feel good about yourself and to make yourself look good to others
59:03
and also as a way to try to get away from not surrendering to God
59:08
um like you're not willing to admit bad motives you look so perfect on the outside
59:15
um and so you can get away with it but when you're doing works out of love for
59:21
God you are doing what you're still doing lots of good works lots of good works
59:28
you're still reading the Bible you're still praying you're still serving in the church you're still doing works
59:36
but it's not religiously you're doing them out of obedience to God because you love God
59:42
amen so you're doing you're doing these Works only because you love God you want to
59:48
obey him and touch his heart and you would be deeply grieved if you ever made
59:54
a mistake not condemned but convicted and grieved where those who are living religiously
1:00:01
they're condemned but not convicted
1:00:09
so it's time to live free of religion free of condemnation
1:00:18
free of judgment this is one of the big Keys some of you
1:00:23
have been struggling to live a pure holy life you really have been struggling you really have been struggling and for
1:00:29
some of you this is what you're missing is that you are bound by the spirit of religion
1:00:35

of you for this religious spirit to leave your lives some of you it's a
1:01:39
spirit you've you have in you a demon of religion a spirit of religion
1:01:46
where this demonic Spirit constantly is speaking this condemnation in your head
1:01:52
this demonic spirit is trying to repel you from God this demonic spirit is trying to keep you from reading the
1:01:58
Bible from praying and you feel like there is a force that's trying to keep you from reading the Bible from spending
1:02:03
time with God from knowing God's love that's because there is it's a demonic Spirit of religion that God is going to
1:02:09
set you free from and there's some of you that you do not have a demon Spirit of religion but
1:02:16
the spirit of religion is coming outwardly speaking to you condemnation it's coming
1:02:21
in a very similar way and after today you will be able to deal
1:02:27
with that spirit in the spiritual realm you'll be able to to recognize what it is and reject it
1:02:33
and have Victory every day amen
1:02:39

1:02:59

[Music] Jesus is kept from being found in lukewarm churches
1:05:13
Jesus is kept from being found when it's only religion that is coming forth in
1:05:19
the word this is why it's so important we must fully embrace the Holy Spirit to have
1:05:25
his way in us and his church
1:05:30
so that he can move and touch people and open up eyes to his great love so they
1:05:38
turn away from religion and fall in love with him and surrender everything
1:05:44
Jesus is concerned about real salvation real salvation not religious works and
1:05:51
religious prayers and repeat after me prayers Jesus is concerned about real
1:05:57
salvation real surrender

1:06:22
the old wineskin to the old ways of the condemnation you would believe of the law keeping that you would live in of
1:06:29
the religious prayers you would recite and the rituals you would do and the religious prayers and fasting and
1:06:34
reading of the Bible you would do may you no longer go back to that life may you live in God's grace may you live
1:06:41
continually in this new revelation he has given you may you live by his Spirit every day in Jesus name
1:06:48
amen thank you Jesus [Applause]
