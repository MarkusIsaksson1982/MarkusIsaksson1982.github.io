hi I'm Apostle Catherine welcome to
0:33
another episode of Revival is now
0:37
on the past few episodes you've been
0:39
learning how to receive Deliverance
0:41
healing and Abundant Life how to receive
0:44
miracles from Jesus and in this revival
0:47
this is what we are seeing a restoration
0:49
of the Miracles Freedom healing
0:54
The Works of the devil destroyed now
0:56
God's Miracles don't happen just any old
0:59
way but he has principles he has order
1:02
and he has a way of releasing his
1:05
miracles you've been learning in these
1:07
past few episodes that one of the big
1:09
keys to receiving Deliverance is
1:11
renouncing to renounce the open doors
1:15
where demons have come in and also
1:18
renouncing the works of the devil the
1:21
bondages in your life and today you're
1:24
going to learn the other major key of
1:27
receiving Deliverance and that is the
1:31
anointing and it shall come to pass in
1:34
that day that his burden shall be taken
1:36
away from off thy shoulder and his yoke
1:39
from off thy neck and the Yoke shall be
1:41
destroyed because of the anointing
1:46
now this picture here when we look at it
1:49
in the Physical Realm
1:51
a yoke
1:53
on the shoulder
1:54
this speaks of a of ox that carry a
1:59
heavy load ox or cattle that carry Goods
2:03
or people and how they would do that how
2:06
did they still do that in some places
2:07
today is they put a brace across the
2:11
oxes or cattle's back
2:14
they put a brace across the axis back on
2:17
their neck
2:18
and it is a brace it is heavy and they
2:22
are stuck in this brace they cannot get
2:25
out of that brace get out of that yoke
2:28
on their own they would need a human to
2:32
lift it off of them and so it's very
2:34
heavy they're stuck that's what a yoke
2:37
is in the Physical Realm so in the
2:40
spiritual realm there are yolks
2:44
spiritual yokes what a yoke is is
2:49
a bondage like that brace around the
2:52
cattle but spiritual a spiritual heavy
2:55
bondage
2:57
that cannot go away
3:00
with your own ability you cannot take it
3:02
off on your own
3:04
but only the anointing can destroy those
3:08
Yokes as it says
3:10
the Yoke shall be destroyed because of
3:14
the anointing the Bible says in John 10
3:17
10 that the devil came to steal kill and
3:19
destroy but I Jesus have come that you
3:23
would have life and have it to the full
3:24
have it in abundance
3:27
and it also says this is this this is
3:29
the reason the son of man came to
3:32
destroy the works of the devil so Jesus
3:36
on the cross
3:37
destroyed the curse of the devil where
3:41
all of his works all the Yokes he would
3:44
bring before
3:46
people were stuck with them as a curse
3:49
but now Jesus has come to destroy that
3:52
curse that the devil would have power
3:54
over God's children
3:56
and now we can receive freedom from the
4:01
Yokes that have entered our lives
4:02
through Jesus
4:04
the thing is is that the devil is still
4:06
at work today Jesus has defeated him
4:09
from having power over us when we put
4:12
our faith in Jesus but when we become a
4:15
Believer we don't automatically just
4:18
become free of everything we don't
4:21
automatically see the devil stop trying
4:24
to send weapons against us in our lives
4:27
it's quite the opposite the devil is
4:30
still at work
4:31
if you can read the word of God
4:35
with Revelation follow the word of God
4:38
be spiritually equipped
4:41
you can have victory over every single
4:44
attack of the devil the problem is is
4:46
that much of the body of Christ has been
4:48
malnourished in the spiritual things and
4:51
the spiritual teachings knowledge their
4:53
eyes have been shut and so the devil's
4:56
still at work and he's able to have
4:59
victory in the forms of succeeding and
5:02
bringing Yokes in people's lives
5:03
stealing killing and destroying because
5:05
many Believers either aren't serious
5:08
about surrendering to God and defeating
5:10
the devil or they don't know how to
5:13
defeat the Devil in many Believers lives
5:17
today there are yokes the devil is
5:21
trying to steal kill and destroy every
5:23
aspect of your life physically
5:25
emotionally spiritually mentally
5:29
financially relationally every part he's
5:33
after
5:34
and so these Yokes can be found
5:38
in every area of your life you may need
5:41
Freedom today
5:43
from yolks in several areas of your life
5:47
so Jesus has come
5:50
so that we can be freed from these Yokes
5:52
and this is what we are learning now how
5:55
to receive that freedom from Jesus that
5:57
he's provided for us on the cross Yokes
6:00
are demons or demonic oppression or
6:03
unclean evil spirits many names but it
6:06
you can simplify it to a yoke or a chain
6:10
a spiritual chain of the devil addiction
6:13
anxiety depression panic attacks night
6:16
terrors demons doing things to you in
6:19
the night a Spirit of Rejection orphan
6:21
Spirit mute Spirit deaf spirit and
6:24
spirit of infirmity and many more these
6:27
are all yokes so when it comes to
6:30
seeking freedom for these Yokes we look
6:32
in the word of God and we find it clear
6:35
as day right here Isaiah 10 27. the Yoke
6:38
shall be destroyed because of the
6:41
anointing
6:42
how
6:44
because of the anointing the anointing
6:48
is needed to destroy the Yoke just as
6:51
the ox cannot lift off the Yoke with its
6:55
own hooves
6:56
it only could come off with the human in
6:59
that case with the ox the human hands in
7:03
the spiritual realm the Yoke can only be
7:06
destroyed by the anointing
7:08
not by physical efforts not by a loud
7:12
voice not by a minister touching a
7:15
person and pushing them down
7:17
not by placing an object on the person's
7:20
head or body not by playing special
7:22
music
7:23
by The anointing you need the anointing
7:28
to destroy the yokes the anointing is
7:31
the power of God the measure of the
7:37
power of God that God places in a vessel
7:42
that measure of the power of God lives
7:46
in a vessel
7:48
and flows through the vessel
7:51
as the vessel obeys God
7:54
through their words through their
7:57
actions through their Ministry
8:00
from the Old Testament to the New
8:02
Testament
8:03
you can see God releasing anointing to
8:07
his vessels and his vessels walking in
8:11
Mighty power of God
8:14
it is the anointing that makes the
8:18
miracles to happen God chooses to use
8:21
people it's just what he chose to do he
8:26
could have done it another way
8:28
he could have made Miracles come from
8:30
this guy he could say whenever you need
8:31
a miracle stand outside your door and
8:35
I'll make it to rain
8:36
on you
8:37
he could have chosen many other ways but
8:40
God chose it this way
8:43
that he would put himself his power
8:47
in a vessel this is I'm saying this by
8:51
and large God can do anything God
8:52
doesn't need to use people and there are
8:54
times where he can choose not to use a
8:56
person because he's God and there's
8:57
always God's always doing different
9:00
things new things he's not confined do
9:02
it has to be this way but he has
9:04
principles and when we look through his
9:06
word there's a way that he moves in the
9:08
most part and that is through people and
9:12
he wants you to know that this is his
9:14
principle this is his way of releasing
9:16
his power so you know where to find his
9:19
power so we see in Elijah that he was
9:21
carrying anointing and he was doing many
9:24
miracles here are some examples Elijah
9:27
brought down fire from heaven to defeat
9:29
his enemies
9:30
there was a widow who was hungry and God
9:33
used him to make there to be miraculous
9:36
provision food for her and her son to
9:38
eat and not die by the power of God
9:41
Elijah raised a dead person back to life
9:43
and as a prophet of God he spoke the
9:46
word and the rain stopped it ceased to
9:50
rain and once again as he spoke the rain
9:54
then began to fall God also used him to
9:57
part the Jordan River and by the way
9:59
when we're speaking of vessels who walk
10:02
in God's power it is God doing all the
10:05
Miracles it is completely his power
10:07
humans who carry the power of God they
10:10
do not have their own Supernatural power
10:13
it is purely Jesus's power we are just
10:16
vessels but God really sees it as a
10:19
partnership that as we obey him as we do
10:22
what he says he releases the power
10:25
through us and he's also given us
10:27
Authority on this Earth
10:29
and so Jesus says to the disciples you
10:32
heal the sick you cast out demons you
10:35
raise the dead well now it is really
10:38
Jesus the one doing it but because God's
10:40
given us Authority and because he honors
10:43
this partnership he chooses to even say
10:46
you do it so side note when you're
10:49
talking about in terms of the proper
10:51
verbiage to use when talking about
10:53
anointed vessels like do you say they
10:55
heal the person or God healed the person
10:57
it doesn't matter too much but what's
11:00
important is for it to be known that it
11:02
is Jesus alone who does every miracle
11:04
and it is Jesus's power but because
11:07
Jesus says you heal the sick if a person
11:10
says this person healed when it's known
11:12
that it's God's power and God's getting
11:14
the glory that's okay but it is Jesus
11:16
power alone who does every Miracle now
11:19
Elijah had a spiritual son Elisha and
11:22
Elisha served him in his ministry and he
11:24
received Elijah's Mantle which means
11:27
that same anointing that God entrusted
11:31
to Elijah It Came Upon Elisha and so
11:35
then Elijah was doing the same Miracles
11:38
that Elijah did Elisha also part of the
11:41
Jordan River by God's power he healed
11:44
people by God's power and he rose people
11:46
from the dead by God's power as well as
11:49
many miracles and even when he died and
11:52
all that was left was his bones his
11:55
bones carried anointing still the Bible
11:58
says that a dead person was thrown on
12:00
Elisha's bones and that dead person came
12:04
to life when he touched Elisha's bones
12:07
this is a true story not a fairy tale
12:10
wow God's anointing is powerful Moses
12:13
was another one who walked in the
12:15
anointing there's so many Miracle signs
12:18
and wonders that God did through Moses
12:20
god used Moses to do Mighty signs and
12:22
wonders and miracles that confounded the
12:25
enemies the Egyptians who held them in
12:27
bondage confounded them made them to
12:30
fear God and ultimately LED them to be
12:33
delivered from the several hundred years
12:35
of slavery God used Moses to cause
12:38
Supernatural plagues to happen and God
12:41
used Moses to part the sea which was the
12:44
moment that they were able to be
12:46
delivered from Egypt and the Seas came
12:49
back together and all their enemies were
12:52
washed away and Moses had a spiritual
12:54
son as well Joshua Joshua Joshua also
12:58
walked in the anointing and he did once
13:01
again a similar Miracle as Moses where
13:03
God used him to part a sea he also used
13:06
him to stop the Sun and then in the New
13:09
Testament we see God doing the same
13:12
thing using vessels with his power to do
13:15
Miracles Jesus talks about how he is
13:17
giving Authority and power over demons
13:21
over all demons and all sicknesses Jesus
13:24
says I'm giving it to you so he's making
13:27
it clear this is how I'm going to do
13:29
America close I'm going to do it by the
13:31
power I put in you he says heal the sick
13:34
cast out demons raise the dead these
13:35
signs shall follow those who believe
13:37
they will lay their hands on sick people
13:39
and they will get well they will cast
13:41
out demons Jesus says you shall do the
13:44
things I did and greater things even
13:49
greater things that means there is no
13:52
limit to what God wants to do through
13:54
his vessels by his power he wants to
13:58
heal every kind of sickness the
13:59
sicknesses that were not around in the
14:01
Biblical times he he wants to and is
14:04
going to heal all those sicknesses
14:07
through his vessels he is going to
14:09
Castle every kind of demon that wasn't
14:11
even talked about in the Bible every
14:14
kind of demonic spirit in yoke he will
14:16
cast out through his vessels now God
14:19
worked unusual Miracles by the hands of
14:21
Paul so that even handkerchiefs or
14:24
aprons were brought from his body to the
14:27
sick and the diseases left them and the
14:30
evil spirits went out of them this is
14:33
powerful because it shows us what they
14:38
did in the times of the acts Church
14:41
which is our example today of how we
14:44
should do church and how to receive
14:47
Miracles so when they needed Miracles
14:50
back then they located the anointing
14:54
they recognized that God had chosen to
14:56
use Apostle Paul with Mighty anointing
14:59
they recognize that the anointing was
15:02
flowing through Apostle Paul so they
15:03
needed to position themselves where
15:06
Apostle Paul was ministering and
15:08
received through that vessel of apostle
15:11
Paul so in this case that anointing was
15:14
so strong extraordinary another
15:16
translation says unusual Miracles were
15:19
happening through Paul I mean it was
15:20
just emanating from him so strongly
15:24
that they were just bringing
15:26
handkerchiefs and aprons to his body to
15:29
his skin just touching his body
15:32
and then Lena on the sick and demon
15:34
possessed and immediately demons refleen
15:35
and this sick were being healed you see
15:38
how effortless it was how it was purely
15:41
the anointing that was making the demons
15:44
to go and the sicknesses to leave it's
15:46
not even saying that Paul was saying
15:48
anything laying hands it was just simple
15:53
the transfer of anointing we also see
15:57
that Apostle Peter was a vessel of the
16:01
anointing and that he walked in high
16:03
level anointing as well the apostles
16:05
performed many signs and wonders among
16:07
the people verse 15. as a result people
16:10
brought the sick into the streets and
16:12
laid them on beds and mats so that at
16:15
least Peter's Shadow might fall on some
16:17
of them as he passed by crowds gathered
16:20
also from the towns around Jerusalem
16:22
bringing their sick and those tormented
16:24
by impure spirits and all of them were
16:28
healed the people in those times were
16:30
doing the same thing as they were doing
16:32
with Apostle Paul they were recognizing
16:34
where the anointing was flowing they
16:37
recognized God had chosen to use Apostle
16:40
Peter a high level anointing was an
16:42
apostle Peter and so they positioned
16:44
themselves under his ministry I knew
16:46
anointing would just be flowing from him
16:49
so they just had to position themselves
16:51
simply that and you can see how these
16:54
these Miracles were happening so
16:55
effortlessly once again just as with
16:57
Paul many people think that to see
17:00
people be delivered be healed we have to
17:02
put a lot of effort into it a lot of
17:04
physical effort whether it's a loud
17:06
voice whether it's laying hands and
17:09
unfortunately sometimes people are
17:10
pushing we should never push
17:12
it doesn't say push people it says lay
17:14
hands
17:16
and let the power of God push people
17:18
touch people a lot of people think
17:21
that's the way that we need to put
17:23
effort into it but God wants to show how
17:26
powerful he is but we have to step back
17:29
get out of the way and allow him to have
17:34
the full Glory allow him to show himself
17:38
to show how Mighty he is
17:41
and so this is so powerful they were
17:44
just coming positioning themselves like
17:46
near Apostle Peter and so his shadow
17:49
falling from the sun beaming on him
17:51
would pass by people and when it did
17:53
demons were literally just leaving sick
17:55
were being healed so simple so powerful
17:58
so effortless why because he carried
18:02
true anointing and the Bible says the
18:05
Yoke shall be destroyed because of the
18:07
anointing period not anointing and human
18:11
effort and Loud Voice period the
18:14
anointing and the anointing of God is so
18:17
powerful you know how powerful God is we
18:20
don't need to help him when we really
18:22
what we need is the actual anointing
18:24
many people are missing the anointing
18:27
and so they're trying to compensate but
18:29
the compensation does not work we need
18:32
the anointing and it says in verse 16.
18:34
all of them were healed
18:38
oh
18:40
all of them all of them not 50 percent
18:44
not even 99
18:47
all of them why
18:50
well one of the big reasons why is
18:53
because Peter actually carried true
18:57
anointing and the anointing of god is
19:01
perfect and without flaw and the
19:03
anointing of God makes every demon to
19:06
tremble and leave they cannot stay the
19:09
anointing of God makes all Darkness to
19:12
leave the anointing of God is like fire
19:15
coming and burning away the darkness
19:19
oh
19:21
how we need the anointing how to find
19:24
the anointing find where the anointing
19:27
is flowing through vessels through
19:28
anointed vessels to here today revivals
19:31
now and when we say revivals now it
19:33
means that God has poured his anointing
19:36
upon vessels and he's releasing this
19:39
anointing through them so where do you
19:41
find them well it's important to
19:43
understand that the anointing is
19:45
something that's rare today and in this
19:47
revival it's becoming less rare
19:50
Hallelujah but we are just beginning
19:53
this revival so it is rare seeing
19:56
everybody healed like they were in Acts
19:58
is pretty much kind of unheard of today
20:00
it's rare and the reason being is that
20:03
the anointing isn't given to every
20:05
single child of God but only Those whom
20:08
God can entrust it with it says in
20:10
Matthew 11 25 this is when the disciples
20:13
first came back from casting out demons
20:16
and they told Jesus and they were
20:18
excited like wow just like the demons
20:20
obeyed you they obeyed I nice and so you
20:24
can see they had anointing Jesus had
20:27
released true anointing
20:30
an authority to them
20:31
and so then Jesus one of the first
20:34
things that he says after they report
20:36
back is he Praises God he says I praise
20:40
you father Lord of Heaven and Earth
20:41
because you have hidden these things
20:43
from the wise and learned and revealed
20:46
them to little children
20:48
you have hidden these things and the
20:51
passion translation it says you have
20:53
hidden the great revelation of your
20:55
Authority from those who are proud and
20:57
wise in their own eyes instead you have
21:00
shared it with those who humble
21:01
themselves yes Father your plan Delights
21:04
your heart as you've chosen this way to
21:06
extend your kingdom by giving it to
21:08
those who have become like trusting
21:10
children so this reveals to us that God
21:13
literally hides the revelation of how to
21:17
receive the anointing and walk in the
21:19
anointing and Authority he hides it from
21:22
many people he hides it from those who
21:25
are proud it does not say he hides it
21:27
from the unbelievers and reveals it to
21:29
the Believers no because a lot of
21:32
Believers are proud a lot of Believers
21:34
are not like children childlike humble
21:38
he only reveals it to the humble and
21:42
childlike that is why the anointing is
21:45
rare today because it does not come
21:47
automatically like the Holy Spirit comes
21:50
automatically when you give your life to
21:51
Jesus the anointing is the holy spirit
21:54
but but there are many dimensions to the
21:57
Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit comes in
22:01
every believer when you give your life
22:02
to Jesus immediately and then when you
22:06
truly surrender everything because
22:09
that's usually different from when you
22:10
first decide to accept Jesus into your
22:13
life as your savior there's a time later
22:15
when you with with spiritual eyes open
22:18
up decide to lay down everything your
22:21
dreams your Wills your plans and you
22:22
mean it with your whole heart and you
22:24
earnestly want all of God and and when
22:28
that happens you receive the baptism of
22:30
the Holy Spirit
22:32
the baptism the Holy Spirit comes upon
22:34
you as fire and the Bible talks about
22:36
how when people were baptized in the
22:38
Holy Spirit in the Bible they begin to
22:39
speak in tongues
22:40
and you receive power and this is the
22:44
place where you are first being readied
22:47
being prepared prepared for Ministry but
22:50
the baptism of the holy spirit is for
22:52
everyone when they're ready to surrender
22:55
but there are a lot of people who have
22:57
that moment of surrender but aren't but
22:59
but are not seen as trustworthy yet and
23:01
in God's eyes meaning they have that
23:03
moment of surrender but they might
23:05
backtrack they might only surrender for
23:08
that one day they might not be humble
23:11
they there's a lot of people who pray in
23:13
tongues but or prideful and are living
23:16
sinfully lukewarm
23:18
so the anointing God only releases to
23:22
Those whom he can entrust where you have
23:24
to go through tests God has to see I've
23:28
tested your character again and again
23:29
I've refined your heart I've transformed
23:32
you to become like me so much that I
23:34
know that when I entrust you with this
23:35
anointing you will truly be able to
23:38
Steward it according to my perfect will
23:40
and not abuse or misuse it ever there
23:42
are different dimensions of the Holy
23:43
Spirit Holy Spirit you receive when you
23:45
first give your life to Jesus then the
23:47
baptisms of the holy spirit is more of
23:50
God it's literally receiving more of God
23:52
in you more of the Holy Spirit
23:55
and then the anointing is receiving yet
23:58
more of God but this aspect is
24:02
specifically for Ministry it's
24:04
specifically for God to use you in power
24:07
it's a gift for Ministry it's a gift to
24:10
be used selflessly for God's will for
24:13
his people to heal the liver raise the
24:16
dead destroy the works of the devil God
24:18

24:19
