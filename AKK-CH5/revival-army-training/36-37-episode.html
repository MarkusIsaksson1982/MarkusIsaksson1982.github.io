I'm going to teach today on order in the kingdom of God you're going to
0:07
understand order and how you can make sure you are in line with God's ways in
0:15
his kingdom so what I'm going to be teaching today is new wine in the
0:22
Revival it's all new wine meaning old wine equals religion equals putting God
0:31
in a box and limiting him and going by
0:38
Traditions doing things out of tradition out of routine doing things just because it's
0:44
all you know and what you've learned and what you've seen others do this is how it was when Jesus came
0:51
when he first came in the gospels he was worshiping the same lord
0:57
well he was one with the Lord but his father was the same Lord as the Pharisees and the
1:03
Sadducees and the John the Baptist and his disciples Lord but they were missing new
1:12
wine they were missing so much revelation of who God is
1:19
and God's ways and what God means in his
1:25
word we need Revelation from the word of God not just just the word of God Alone
1:31
we need Revelation from the Holy Spirit the proper Revelation from the Holy
1:38
Spirit there can be believers who have the Holy Spirit
1:43
but they have not been equipped and taught received the the equipping that
1:50
comes from leaders anointed leaders they have not received that new wine
1:57
equipping and teaching so though people have the Holy Spirit they have not gotten the proper spiritual
2:05
equipping and even though they have the Holy Spirit they read the Bible and
2:11
they're not getting really the true proper revelation of what the Holy
2:16
Spirit wants them to have but they are getting the old wine
2:22
Revelation here is an example that we have in the word there's a time when John the Baptist disciples were fasting
2:29
like the Pharisees were fasting it was a particular way of fasting it was their
2:34
Revelation and interpretation of the word of God when it speaks on fasting and these people John the
2:41
Baptist disciples they're seeing Jesus's disciples and Jesus are not fasting like all of them were and Jesus's response
2:50
immediately is that he begins to speak about the new wine the old wine versus
2:56
the new wine and so he says you cannot put new wine into old wine
3:04
Skins new wine expands old wine Skins are are tight do not they don't they
3:12
aren't flexible they're rigid so when you put the new wine and it expands the wine
3:20
skins will burst and the wine the new wine will be ruined so it can't work so Jesus says
3:28
You must have new wine skins to receive the new wine that is Jesus's response to their
3:36
question about fasting what what it feels like what does it have to do with
3:42
it it's perfect though it's a perfect explanation Jesus is telling them the
3:47
reason why I'm we're fasting differently is because you have old wine old wine
3:54
skins and I am bringing the new wine I am bringing the the true proper
4:02
and fullness of the revelation of what God is speaking in his word in many
4:08
different aspects including when it comes to fasting long to summarize how
4:14
Jesus was teaching his disciples to fast was simply being led by the Holy Spirit
4:20
versus just doing out of tradition and going through the motions and because someone says it's time the time of the
4:27
year to fast now like we always do you know um that's the summary of the
4:34
Revelation in short of uh Jesus's new wine true way of
4:41
fasting okay so what he is saying in this is that we worship the same God we
4:49
have the same Bible the Pharisees the Sadducees and John the Baptist disciples and Jesus same God same word of God
4:58
but your your Revelation and understanding of God and his ways and
5:04
his word there's a lot wrong with it a
5:10
lot not just a little so we need to get rid of this get rid of all of this I
5:18
mean not get rid of the fact that you love God of course no but I mean like all of this Doctrine you've
5:26
accumulated you need to humble yourself don't don't hold on to it so rigidly
5:32
like this is the only way and I'm a professional Christian professional in
5:40
theology you know don't be that way instead Let It Go instead empty yourself
5:48
meaning take out all the doctrine that you've accumulated and just all the all all of
5:54
your Revelation that you have understanding you have of God's ways God's ways of fasting God's ways of
6:02
ministering to people God's ways of casting out demons God's ways of praying God's ways of hear hearing the voice of
6:10
God God's ways of ministering and how God wants Church to look like and like
6:18
like what everything that's happening in the church all of that Doctrine all of
6:24
those ways that like you're like this is how you do this this is how you do this empty it out before
6:31
you put it in your hands in the spiritual realm and let me God let God
6:38
take out what is the old wine and replace it with the new wine so your
6:45
revelation of how to fast is wrong we're taking that out completely and we're I'm
6:50
putting in you to you the new wine way of fasting and this goes for every
6:57
different kind of aspect of what it means to uh our calling as a
7:02
Believer God's commands God's ways so for a lot of people in this
7:10
revival right now for most people I mean we have not looked like
7:17
the acts Church in the body of Christ and that simply
7:23
means there is a whole lot of new wine
7:28
missing there's a lot of old wine it's just like
7:33
when Jesus first came in the gospels there was people worshiping God there was people reading the word of God there
7:40
was people going to the temple the church they were they were really
7:45
following God and worshiping God and loving God but guess what there was not the
7:52
power of the Holy Spirit there was not healings and deliverances
7:57
happening there was not encounters with God's power that opened up eyes to God's
8:06
amazing love which moves one to full surrender and then Jesus comes on the
8:13
scene and he brings that he brings his holy spirit he brings his anointing he
8:18
brings his new wine so there's so much parallels
8:24
to today in the church yes people ha have been studying
8:32
the word of God they've been going to church they've been worshiping God they've been loving God but there's been
8:38
such a lack of the power of the Holy Spirit of the anointing there's been such a lack of the aspects of the acts
8:47
Church which are so so core and foundational to the believer that the
8:53
power of the Holy Spirit would be upon your life you'd be baptized on in the Holy Spirit you you you would
9:00
walk in the power of the Holy Spirit and in the church the prophetic anointing would be moving there would be prophecy
9:06
there would be healing of the sick that would be casting out of demons this is core Central foundational of what church
9:13
should look like according to the axe Church all right so um really the body
9:21
of Christ needs to Humble itself we the all believers need to Humble themselves
9:27
to be able to receive the new wine oh what is this new way of fasting that
9:32
I'm hearing about before it's the new wine you know and so there's so many
9:38
different aspects of this new wine that God is restoring and it's not optional if we want Revival we if we want to be a
9:45
part of the end time Revival we also have to accept God's ways we have to
9:50
accept God's new wine that's been missing we have to accept God's true
9:57
Doctrine in his new wine and this is a lot of different
10:02
aspects a lot of different parts I mean uh to the fact that God is God
10:09
wants to use Apostles and Prophets that's been missing how church should look like the the the fact that there
10:16
should be casting out of demons and healing of the sick and and prophecy you
10:21
know and just so many different aspects of ministry and being a Believer a lot
10:28
of new wine here hearing God's voice it needs to be new wine not this religious
10:33
way amen so if you are new here welcome to the end time Revival it
10:42
is here and in my Ministry at fivefold church where I Pastor first of all God
10:47
has given us this name of five-fold church because in this end time Revival he's restoring what has been lost and
10:54
one of the big things he's of what he's restoring is the five-fold ministry the fful ministry is crucial it's
11:01
foundational to see the other things that are missing come to see the power of God in vessels come impartation to
11:09
other vessels come equipping to to be mature Believers and
11:14
walk in God's power for that to come for the healing of the sick and the casting out of demons to come and this new wine
11:23
meat spiritual meat also comes through these ministries of Apostles and Prophets
11:30
so here at fold church it's new wine it is nothing but new wine Hallelujah that
11:39
means that here at fivefold church we only fear God and we don't fear man
11:46
because a lot of people don't like the new wine A lot of people are offended by the new wine A lot of people are holding
11:53
so tightly onto the old wine to the ways that they've known um and so that's what
12:00
we're about at fivefold church to only fear God and for only his true new wine
12:08
Doctrine to come forth and for the Holy Spirit to have his absolute way every
12:15
Sunday every live every single time that there would no not be any kind
12:21
of you know selfish desires or um people
12:27
pleasing or any of that but it would be completely
12:33
holy spirit's desire holy spirit's plans going forth for all the ministry
12:39
for all of the teaching amen hallelujah so what I'm
12:44
about to share that was a big really big just introduction because what I'm sharing is
12:51
new wine and you have to be able to understand that you have to humble yourself to shed the old wine skin to
12:58
come here humbly with new wine skin right now so that you can receive the new wine that I'm releasing that God's
13:04
releasing through me to you right now amen all right so I'm going to be speaking on order in the kingdom of God
13:12
first of all we are not just Believers we are not just Christians we are not just a group
13:20
of Believers across the world a group of Christians we are actually more
13:28
accurately children of God in God's
13:35
kingdom the kingdom of God has spoken about so many times in the word but so
13:41
many people just dismiss the meaning of it just say the kingdom of God and don't
13:49
really think or Ponder or under seek revelation of what it means to be in a
13:55
kingdom of God to be in a king Kingdom that means there's going to be order
14:03
that means that there's going to be different levels of authorities that walk in their Authority
14:11
in their position to accomplish God's will it's
14:16
like when you think about a government you know I'll just give because a
14:22
government is very similar to meaning to a kingdom so you think about the government we'll say of America for
14:28
example so um there's ideals of America there's
14:34
a certain Vision that there has always been ever since the foundation of the
14:39
country such as that the people in the this the nation would experience Justice
14:47
freedom freedom of religion for one freedom in many areas and that there would be peace and
14:56
that there would be opportunity there would be opportunity for people to
15:02
live their dreams and accomplish whatever they're capable of regardless of their
15:08
background where they may be immigrated from regardless of their skin color
15:14
regardless of their culture their
15:20
upbringing that they would have equal opportunity right those are just some examples of some ideals of vision of
15:27
America and and now in this nation there are there's a government there's a
15:35
president for example there's Governors there's Mayors and then you also have different
15:43
areas of people who are in places of authority to really accomplish the same
15:51
ideals such as police men and women such
15:57
as lawyers such as judges and also you have
16:03
teachers you know if especially when you think about public education it's like it's all like connected it's all
16:10
connected and so when you're a teacher for example you're there's going to be this mandate to not go against those
16:17
ideals and vision of the nation of what I just shared right and then you can go
16:24
all the way down to parents parents have authority over their children teachers
16:29
have authority over their students and all these different policemen and women
16:34
they have a a territory of authority lawyers have a territory of authority judges have a territory of authority
16:41
Mayors have a territory of Authority or domain Governors do as well and so does
16:46
the president and so there's PE all these people place in all these
16:52
different places of authority and when they are executing their Authority walking in their Authority in their
16:58
Dominion it makes the ideals of the nation the vision of the nation go forth okay so
17:05
that's just me kind of breaking down what's actually going on in a government and a kingdom it's not just random it's
17:12
not just a word government the kingdom it's not just a word right well many
17:18
things on this Earth all things on this I mean so many things came from God so many things came from God's
17:26
principles and government Kingdom this is one of them this has come from God
17:32
the kingdom of God so I share this example to get you to understand
17:38
how King the meaning of kingdom of God God has given all of
17:45
us places of authority in the spiritual realm all of us are in different
17:53
positions different levels of authority but when we all do our part
17:58
part the kingdom of God will advance the most God's will will be done the most
18:06
when every part does their job and it's having to do with walking in
18:13
Authority so you have for one you have at the top level like at the
18:19
presidential type level or higher level of government type level you have Apostles and Prophets and then you and
18:27
then the next level would be evangelists and pastors and teachers and so these are on the higher level where God will
18:33
give the high highest levels of anointing and authority to be dealing with the toughest demonic cases in
18:41
people principalities generational curses God
18:47
gives this special anointing and authority over them and it says in Ephesians
18:52
4:11 nkjv version and he himself GES gave some so this is not all it says in
18:59
the nkjv version it says Jesus himself gave some to be Apostles not all some to
19:09
be Apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the equipping of the Saints
19:14
for the work of Ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we
19:21
all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to to a perfect man to the measure of the
19:28
stature of the fullness of Christ that we should no longer be children
19:34
spiritually tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine I was just talking about
19:41
Doctrine the old wine when we don't have the fful ministry we won't be
19:47
equipped to know what's the true Doctrine and we'll be stuck in the old
19:52
wine Doctrine and other whatever people feel the doctrine they want to speak and
19:59
teach on by the trickery of men in the cunning
20:05
craftiness of deceitful plotting but speaking the truth and love may grow up in all things into him who is the head
20:13
Christ so we see this is this is the purpose of the Apostles prophets
20:19
evangelist pastors and teachers is for the equipping of the Saints so here they
20:25
equipping is going on for you to do your job in your place in the Kingdom
20:32
equipping is is happening for you for all believers to take up their place of
20:40
authority in their domain that God has given them so that they can do exactly
20:48
what God wants them to do and fulfill their purpose there has to be equipping
20:54
for that and that's what the fful ministry does and it also o says this equipping will happen till we all come
21:02
to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect man and to the measure of the sture of the fullness of Christ so if the body of
21:10
Christ does not look perfect yet that means we still need the five- whole Ministry that means we still need in in
21:15
addition to pastors teacher and evangelists we need Apostles and Prophets to bring this equipping still
21:22
we will not come into this perfect measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Christ a perfect man
21:30
that will not come till Jesus returns so Apostles and Prophets God is using to
21:36
equip the body of Christ bringing this essential equipping until Jesus returns that they were never supposed to go away
21:43
and this has been a scheme of the devil because the devil knows these principles he knows that without Apostles and Prophets the whole body of Christ is
21:50
missing out on essential equipping in the spiritual realm that they need and missing out on the anointing
21:58
the grace that Apostles and Prophets walk in to carry high level anointing to
22:04
cast out demons heal the sick and to release this anointing of impartation to to the
22:10
Believers Revival is now and God is restoring now Apostles and Prophets
22:15
praise God so we have the fful ministry at the
22:21
highest level of authority and when they do their job they're walking in their Authority God's kingdom advances and the
22:27
devil's kingdom is destroyed destroyed and in doing their job they're equipping th all of those Believers all
22:35
of the Believers to walk in their place of authority so that they can advance the kingdom in what they're called to do
22:43
and destroy the devil's Kingdom so we're all walking in our
22:49
authority to advance God's kingdom by by walking in the authority I
22:55
mean for a for for for all believers a big meaning of this is only speaking life
23:02
and making sure to open your mouth and Speak Life and allow God to move through your tongue it means never speaking
23:08
death so rather than bringing curses and working for the Devil by what you're
23:14
speaking you are working for God and you're being a partner with God Allowing God to move through you and at the same
23:21
time you're not being stagnant by you know not by just staying by just by not
23:28
speaking God's true word and declaring it despite the circumstances and the lies of the
23:34
devil that are in your head amen so just wanted to give you first of all
23:41
this understanding of the Kingdom because this is foundational for the rest of what I'm going to teach about
23:47
God's order today you need to understand how we are in a kingdom and that there is order we are
23:55
not just a hodge podge group of Believers that just do the same thing
24:02
and just do what we feel no we are in a kingdom that has
24:11
order in the government here we don't see a parent going into the teacher's
24:17
classroom and doing the teacher's job the parent stays in their own place
24:24
in their own position and lets the teacher do their job we don't see the governor going into the
24:32
Oval Office and trying to do the president's job trying to execute their
24:38
Authority in the president's domain we do not see that happening that would be
24:44
disorder that would be chaos that would be foolishness and it's the opposite of
24:51
unity Unity is when we are all doing what we are called to do and we see that
24:57
we all need each other you know we see that we need the teachers we see that we need the policemen and women we see that
25:05
we need the judges we see that we need the mayor the governor the president and we don't get jealous of them we don't
25:11
try to do what they're doing no we do what we are supposed to do we respect
25:18
what all those other leaders are doing and we just stay in our own place and do
25:23
our job let them their do their job and that's how there will be unity and
25:30
that's how the kingdom will advance the most well the government the I where
25:35
there will be peace and the ideals of the government will or of the nation I mean rather will go forth right so it's
25:43
the same for the kingdom of God it's the same for the kingdom of God we have to know our territory our
25:52
domain our place and we must make sure we are not stepping out of that going
25:59
out of order the Bible says a kingdom divided against itself cannot
26:05
stand so you know having this old wine
26:11
doctrine of where a bunch of hodg Podge Christians and we can just do all the same things and whatever we feel a lot
26:18
of that goes on in the church today that's bringing disunity that's
26:23
bringing disorder and the devil loves that because that's where he can fool around that's where he can hide that's
26:30
where he can actually use Believers to cause damage within the
26:36
church um so it's very serious that we are reverent to God's order and his ways
26:45
in his kingdom James 3:1 says not many of you
26:51
should become teachers my fellow Believers because you know that we who
26:56
teach will be judged more
27:01
strictly I'm going to read that again not many of you should become
27:07
teachers now this corresponds with Ephesians 4 where it says that Jesus
27:15
gave some to be Apostles prophets evangelist pastors and teachers not
27:20
all some this goes along with it not many of
27:26
you should become teachers my fellow Believers because you know that we who teach will be judged more
27:33
strictly so he's saying here stop thinking this is glamorous stop thinking stop wanting to be like us just rest in
27:43
what God has called you to it's not all it seems in fact it's a
27:48
great risk if you're trying to jump over here and do what we're doing because if
27:54
you are don't going prematurely or you're going where God has never called you you're going to be judged this is
28:01
New Testament it says we who teach will be judged more strictly that means all who teach whether they were called by
28:08
God they're going to be judged meaning did you teach according to
28:13
everything I led you to did you speak from the holy spirit always you know
28:20
we're those of us who teach this is New Covenant this is James we're going to be
28:26
judged by God and so it's a serious deal it's not
28:31
something to take lightly it's something to have the fear of God over reverence for God to not take lightly teach that
28:38
what we teach and how we Minister and also if you are teaching and you were
28:43
not called to teach you are also going to be judged and that's going to be very it's going to automatically be a bad
28:49
judgment because God never called you to that number one and number two if God didn't call you you're not going to be
28:55
hearing accurately from the Holy Spirit of what to teach of how to teach because you don't have that Grace on you so when
29:03
God gives Apostles prophets evangelist pastors and teachers when he gives a person that calling he commissions them
29:08
he speaks to them he commissions them he calls them he anoints them he gives them
29:15
a special Grace so that they can operate in that
29:22
calling they have special Grace where they can be perfectly led by the Holy
29:27
Spirit as long as they're surrendered and fearing God being reverent to our god they
29:34
can every day every time it's time to minister they have the grace to hear
29:40
from the Holy Spirit to deliver the pure new wine anointed word and when it comes
29:46
to ministering when it comes to praying for people they can do it how God wants how holy spirit's leading in the new
29:53
wine because only because they are given a special Grace this is the only reason
30:01
it's possible because they are given a special Grace so if you are not called
30:08
by God and anointed to be an Apostle Prophet evangelist pastor and teacher and you try to be these things whether
30:15
it's from the stage from online like alive like this or it's in
30:24
other ways it's one onone you are acting as a five-fold minister in certain
30:32
ways whatever case you will not have the
30:38
grace God doesn't go against his ways he does not be manipulated so he's not like
30:44
oh this person just wants to be a fivefold minister so badly and they're just forcing it so well okay then I'll
30:52
release my spirit to them and give them the words to say and no no
30:59
you can't manipulate God God and his ways you can't make him go against his
31:05
ways so if someone is operating as a fivefold minister teaching when they
31:12
shouldn't be teaching trying to deal with demons they weren't called to deal
31:19
with you know trying to trying to act like Apostle Paul as in Acts 1911 it
31:25
said God did extraordinary Miracles through him meaning there was a high level anointing
31:30
on him to deal with even principalities if you try to deal with a
31:35
higher principalities and you're just on a mission to cast out whatever demon comes in your way or something or go out
31:41
of your way to cast out any kind of demon when God didn't call you to do that when you're doing all of these
31:47
things there's not Grace upon you there's not Grace upon you and this is detrimental to your spiritual health and
31:53
then it's also damaging to people that you are trying to minister
32:01
to it's not going to be pure from the holy spirit because you don't have that
32:06
Grace so this is something so serious I got to tell you this is something so so
32:13
so so so so serious and the old wine a lot of this isn't talked about and it's
32:19
not understood the seriousness of it pretty much most people are saying that
32:26
God told them they're in a Apostle God told them they were a prophet God told them this this this this this and it's
32:33
simply not the case and God doesn't work that way when calling people their
32:39
offices it is spoken through a five-fold minister specifically in most cases it
32:46
will be where you are planted for example Let's Pretend We're
32:53
in the times of apostle Paul and he is the leader of this church of a church of the church and he has many spiritual
33:02
children there's God is not going to hide from Paul this person over here is
33:09
an apostle this person over here is a Prophet this person over here is a pastor he's not going to hide that from Paul and instead speak this to that
33:15
person that person that person that's not how God works it's the opposite he speaks to the leader this
33:24
person is called to be this this and this this office if that's what they're called to and he reveals it in whatever
33:31
Tim in God's want but God wants but he will he will cause the leader to speak
33:37
it you are an apostle you are a prophet you are a pastor according to God's
33:46
timing those who hear that calling need to hear it at the right time or
33:54
everything could go wrong I received my calling at age 25
34:01
September eight years from this September and it was a couple years
34:07
prior when I had no clue what I was supposed to do what I was what I was
34:13
supposed to do with my life after graduating college and that would have been in my my mind back then a perfect
34:21
time for God to reveal I'm called to be an apostle then I wouldn't have had to waste a few years or so
34:28
about 2 and a half years or so being a starving artist and going after acting
34:34
and singing when that wasn't my calling but guess what that was not God's timing
34:39
it was God's perfect timing to speak the calling to
34:44
me at age 25 n months after I
34:50
surrendered everything to God after encountering his power for the first
34:56
time so when I received that word I could be like Mary and be humble and
35:02
trust God cuz I met him I met him for the first time nine months prior even
35:07
though I've been a Christian my whole life I met him by his power and when I met him my eyes open up to how amazing
35:14
he was I didn't know how he was that amazing before I believed he was amazing but I didn't know just how amazing until
35:20
age 25 when I met him and so when I received this prophecy you're called to me an apostle at the time when I wanted
35:27
to be a singer songwriter and I and public speaking was my biggest fear and weakness and I had no desire to be any
35:33
kind of preacher any kind of Minister I could just receive the word like Mary did I'm a servant of the Lord
35:40
yes and amen I could come in a humble place I don't understand this I don't I
35:46
don't get this I don't get how I'm going to be able to do this public speaking is my biggest fear and weakness but it
35:52
doesn't matter it's God who's calling me right now and I trust him and who am I
35:57
but a mere servant so yes Lord but I don't think I would respond that way if
36:03
I if I received that 10 months prior or a few years before that so all that to
36:09
say is that there was no dream or Vision or Audible Voice spoken to me prior to
36:16
age 25 about eight years ago when I received that prophecy there was no
36:23
other kind of word that God spoke or Inkling
36:28
that God spoke to me before that now that's not to say that God never does that God absolutely will do that
36:34
sometimes sometimes he may give an impression to someone in their Spirit you're called to be an apostle or a
36:40
prophet and but it's to be taken with a grain of salt because God's main way of
36:47
releasing callings to people is to be spoken through the leader of where they
36:53
are planted that's how it can be confirmed this person's anointed rather
37:00
than this person just felt to do this so so many things in in the Kingdom there
37:06
needs to be there needs to be this confirmation there needs to be true
37:12
trusted annointed leaders that are for sure anointed leaders in the body of Christ confirming yes this person is
37:19
Anointed that's important it's a a beautiful important way of God because
37:25
that's how the Believers can trust that this person is truly anointed not
37:31
God anointed me but a true anointed servant of God
37:36
you know is a true anointed servant of God you trust you respect says confirms yes this person is Anointed by God they
37:44
are an apostle they are a pastor so it's very important we go with
37:50
God's ways you know I come to you I do not say I'm an apostle on my own accord I say it to you only because a Prophet a
37:58
true prophet of God spoke this I do not say I'm an apostle because
38:05
God told me on my own it was a prophet a true prophet of God who spoke
38:12
this amen hallelujah so
38:18
um the role of a fivefold minister the
38:23
role of a leader of a church is to to feed the
38:30
Believers they have the grace to know the spiritual food that the Believers
38:37
need they have that Grace they have the prophetic anointing
38:44
the grace of the prophetic anointing to hear from God AR RMA present tense word
38:50
and release it they also release the anointing upon
38:59
the the Believers of impartation just as Paul released to
39:05
Timothy as Elijah released to Elisha as as Moses released to
39:12
Joshua that's their role it's their role to speak
39:17
prophetically to speak prophetic Direction corporately and individually that's their role and their
39:25
assignment and what they have the grace to do and they also have the role of casting
39:32
out demons and Healing The Sick releasing the high level anointing and
39:37
Authority they've been given by God to deal with all kinds of demonic
39:43
cases sicknesses problems spiritual problems that's their
39:50
job the role and job of the believer who is not a five-fold minister
39:57
is to come in the church is to come and receive this is in person and virtually
40:05
come and receive the food so the job of the fivefold minister the leader of the church is to feed is to release the food
40:13
the job of the believer is to receive the food not to do the leader of the
40:22
church's job and be a teacher to to others in the
40:30
church all of the the Sheep the Believers are supposed to be fed by the
40:37
shepherd the leader of the church that's that's how they get their
40:43
all of their food and they receive equipping to walk
40:49
in authority and their own spiritual life to have victory over the devil and
40:55
they also receive equipping of how to walk in authority when God is calling them to
41:04
cast out demons theirselves heal the sick themselves and allow God to use them to
41:11
speak through them but that
41:18
equipping and impartation that the Believers get is to be used in their ter
41:27
in the spiritual realm in their domain so what does that look like well
41:34
the biggest place of every believer's domain territory like where God is
41:41
calling you to execute your Authority in Christ and pray for the sick and cast out demons and um speak allow God to
41:48
speak through you the biggest area of domain is going to be different places
41:55
throughout your life with we are interacting with people that don't know Jesus that or if
42:03
they do know Jesus but they're in the old wine people who are outside of the
42:10
church that you're a part of like people maybe in your
42:16
workplace people where you're doing errands maybe you're at a gathering a
42:22
social Gathering or something people there family members friends friends
42:28
friends from the past this this is your domain where God
42:33
will call you to walk in your Authority but what's important to know is that
42:39
what's important to know is we are working as a team together
42:45
and we are a kingdom meaning you
42:50
know God's ways is that every believer would be a part of a true
42:58
anointed church because God's way of equipping
43:03
the Believers is through the five-fold ministry so God anoints a five-fold
43:10
minister to be a Shepherd leader of a church here and here and another church
43:17
and another church and another church around the world and God calls every
43:23
believer to be planted at one of these Church churches true anointed
43:29
churches because without that you won't receive the equipping and the the
43:35
nourishment spiritual nourishment and food and impartation that you need
43:40
because God doesn't go against his ways this is God's ways of equipping feeding releasing impartation equipping
43:47
the Believers is in the Church the true church through a true anointed
43:54
leader so where we we we should not have we need to have a heart to birth people
44:00
into the kingdom of God we should not have a heart for we
44:08
should not have only a heart for people to be born again babies in
44:15
Christ for babies to be birthed into the kingdom but we should also have a heart
44:20
for the people to the Born Again Believers the people who can that have
44:25
just come to know Jesus to mature to be
44:31
equipped because if you're just focused if you only have a heart for people to just just be saved
44:38
alone they're a baby in the spiritual realm what happens to babies if they're left on the street they're not going to
44:46
survive every child of God desperately
44:51
needs this true equipping that comes from fivefold Ministry spiritual meat
44:57
insight into the spiritual realm equipping of how to defeat the Devil that's the only way you'll move
45:05
forward grow and not die spiritually I mean there's so many people that are so
45:11
beaten up by the devil they're so oppressed they even renounced their faith because they think God left them
45:17
it wasn't the case at all they were a baby on the street in the spiritual realm they never got into a true
45:24
anointed Church to be nurtured so they could grow and be equipped and
45:30
be stronger than the devil and know how to fight the good fight of Faith so like God wants you to see
45:39
people like in the workplace and when you're doing errands and and your family members your friends like
45:45
all these people in your life he wants you to have eyes for them to be in the
45:51
Kingdom not just to be saved not just to know Jesus but to be to come into the
45:59
Kingdom so that they can have lasting salvation Abundant Life fulfill their
46:05
purpose be set free from demonic oppression so where God has planted
46:13
you you are called to birth you're a sheep that's called to birth more sheep
46:18
Shepherds that's not their calling their Shepherds is to feed the sheep but the Sheep's job is to birth more sheep into
46:24
the kingdom into the church so where how you have seen your life
46:30
Changed by being at a church where God has called you to be planted how you've grown how you've become closer to Jesus
46:37
how now you are you you have anointing in your life God wants you to have that heart for everybody but but so you need
46:44
to understand that there's a way they need to do what you did they need to
46:49
they need to come where the anointing is and plant themselves
46:54
there all right and so so like the biggest thing that God is
47:01
calling you to do on a day-to-day basis as you be the light to the world is have
47:07
that intention I want them to be born into the kingdom I want them to come into the kingdom and so the big thing
47:14
you can do is invite people to church it'll look differently like you know how you'll have conversations with
47:20
people that will lead to talking about Jesus in some cases you know sometimes it might just simply be come to church
47:26
I've received all this healing and deliverance if they're open if the conversation goes there you know not
47:32
forcing on people but you know as Holy Spirit leads you to talk more about
47:37
Jesus and everything it should quickly go to you need to come to my church
47:42
where I've received so much because you're thinking about them long term not just today you're not just thinking like
47:51
o I want to see them experience God's love through me today you know you're thinking
47:57
longterm not thinking selfishly how can God use me to touch
48:03
them and I can feel more spiritual and I can share others about it so they can see me as spiritual no you're thinking
48:08
longterm you're thinking really about the person about their spiritual health and so on the dayto day you shouldn't go
48:15
with that intention of like what can I do to feel like
48:21
I'm this great Christian what can I do to make people see that I'm so
48:29
spiritual that's selfish your intention should be to serve your heart intention
48:34
to be to serve your heart intention should be I want these people to come into the kingdom and there's a way that
48:39
I can help people get into the Kingdom so many times that's going to look like
48:45
if the conversation goes there with the person inviting them to church sharing with them the social media sharing with
48:52
them how much you received and and say come and receive too that's how it may look a majority of the time of you
48:59
shining your light you know it doesn't have to always be like a I have to get them to say the sinner's prayer and I
49:06
have to pray for them I really want to oh this person has anxiety I really want to go and cast that demon out of her
49:12
right now that shouldn't be your heart God may lead you to uh pray for someone
49:17
who has anxiety for example at the workplace or something he may call you to walk in your Authority in your domain
49:24
and command that demon to leave her he may do do that and that may be a moment where her eyes open up and now she wants
49:30
more or he he or she wants more and now you can now he or she wants to come to
49:35
church with you and everything Holy Spirit can lead like that but it's important to know that sometimes you
49:43
don't need to feel like you always have to pray for someone or something to be you being used powerfully by God
49:49
sometimes just inviting them or sharing with them about church where you're planted is is what God is asking you to
49:57
do so the big important thing to remember here is that it's not about you
50:03
it's having the heart to see someone be born into the kingdom and when that's your heart and intention you'll be able
50:09
to hear the Holy Spirit leading you sometimes it'll be really simple sometimes it'll be just simply sharing
50:15
how you've received so much and inviting them or just hey you should check this out online sometimes it'll be something
50:21
simple like that and that's it there's you know you you didn't pray for them or
50:27
anything you don't need to feel like I I I should have prayed for them you know some sometimes God will lead you to do
50:33
that but it's not all the time I say this because it's important to know our our role it's important to R our not
50:39
role in the Kingdom sheep are to birth sheep into the
50:45
kingdom they're not it's not their role to feed it's not their role to deal with
50:51
high uh really serious demonic cases so um um acts 5:12 says the apostles
51:00
performed many signs and wonders among the people and all the Believers used to
51:05
meet together in Solomon's colad um no one else now there's a
51:10
there's a reason why the scripture says specifically Apostles performed many signs and wonders it doesn't say all
51:16
believers were performing many signs and wonders now the Bible says all who believe these signs will follow them they shall cast out demons they shall
51:22
heal the sick as some of these signs but it's not confuse it that the believer's
51:29
role in the area of casting out demons and Healing The Sick is the same as five-fold ministers there's a reason why
51:35
it says specifically the apostles perform many signs and wonders among the people is because that is really the the
51:43
the the biggest kinds of Miracle signs and wonders and the the the ones that are going to be doing this on such a regular basis and dealing with highle
51:51
demonic cases and higher higher level spiritual problems is going to be fivefold ministers spefic specifically
51:57
Apostles and Prophets the most so that's not just random that it says this
52:05
scripture that the apostles perform many signs and wonders among the people Paul also says several times a true sign of
52:10
an apostle is that they walk in signs wonders and miracles um and and I say this
52:18
because if you don't have this understanding there can be a temptation to step out of your role
52:27
and step into the realm of a fful minister stepping beyond what God has
52:33
called you to if you don't have this Revelation I'm sharing with you here there can be a Temptation from the
52:40
angel of Light saying you're not doing enough for God look at this person casting out all these demons and Healing
52:47
The Sick and da D you're not that's the the the devil can come in that
52:52
way in the purpose with the purpose of trying to get you out of order and get you out of
52:59
God's Will and get you into dangerous places spiritually and get you to a
53:04
place where you're harming the Sheep because you're operating as a fold Minister when you were not called to do
53:11
that so it says in Acts 5:12 or 13 no one else I'm going to skip
53:17
on nevertheless more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number as a result people
53:23
brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter's Shadow might fall on some
53:29
of them as he passed by crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem bringing their sick and those tormented
53:34
by impure spirits and all of them were
53:40
healed why were all healed this is some Revelation I'm going to give to you why
53:45
all were healed like why was Peter so
53:52
effective in Ministry and cast down demons and Healing The Sick why number
53:58
one because he was given high level
54:03
anointing and authority to deal with the highest level demons like
54:10
principalities where no demon no sickness could stay this is how it is supposed to be in the kingdom of God
54:16
when we operate accurately when we really have the anointing that it would not be an even fight with demons that
54:23
there wouldn't be such thing as such like stubborn demons you know that we're losing our
54:29
voices over and energy over hours spending trying to cast out a demon it's
54:34
not supposed to be that way at all the anointing the power of God is so much more so much stronger than the highest
54:41
level demons but God doesn't release his highest level anointing just anywhere he has he has his ways so he's putting on
54:50
Apostle Peter here this high level anointing and Authority he's given him
54:55
this grace as an apostle to deal with the toughest demonic cases and so they just came under the
55:02
shadow so what they were doing is they was they were positioning themselves to receive the fall of the anointing the
55:08
anointing to fall upon them and boom they were all healed and freed easy boom
55:15
that's the power of the anointing this is what God is doing now we are seeing
55:21
this happen now if you're new here welcome to Revival welcome to the acts
55:26
Church restored Hallelujah but seriously we are seeing this we are seeing
55:33
one-on-one prayer not being necessary at all because it's the authority The
55:40
Authority executed the true Authority when the true Authority high level Authority is there and anointing is there and the authority is executed all
55:47
the demons have to go that's what makes demons to go not one-on-one prayer it's the authority executed so that's the
55:55
number two reason why Peter was so effective because he was operating in his authority effectively I tell you
56:02
what if he gave into people
56:08
pleasing and just went with how he felt and decided to try to pray for as
56:14
many people one-on-one as possible and was there for hours I tell you he wouldn't have been as
56:20
effective because the more we operate in
56:26
the the true principle of God in all his principles but in this area the principle of
56:32
authority the more we are in line operating in line with this spiritual
56:39
law we're not going outside gr blurring the lines we are operating really in how
56:45
Authority works that's when demons cannot
56:52
hide anywhere and they are forced to obey
56:57
God's kingdom goes by principles it's not like Lord I really want you to cast out all these demons here no walk in the
57:05
authority the proper way according to God's principles that we understand by his new wine Revelation and his word
57:13
then all the demons will go so that's what Peter was doing he wasn't he he he just walked by and he walked by just
57:20
walk he could have said just one word like when I walk by all the demons in here must leave and all the sicknesses
57:25
must go and he walked by and all the demons had to obey because he was truly
57:31
operating in Authority properly using his authority
57:37
properly to assign a bunch of people to pray for people within his authority his
57:43
domain is actually going outside the principle of authority in the spiritual
57:48
realm and that's where demons can hide and fool around because you are going
57:54
outside of the laws outside of the principles it's because people are not
57:59
used to having the anointing the real true powerful anointing they are struggling to cast out demons so
58:06
therefore they try other ways they try other methods because they don't know what
58:12
else to do and that's what now we have the old wine way of casting out demons
58:17
this is the new wine this is the biblical way we never see we never see
58:22
in one time of ministry many people casting out demons in the crowd we see
58:29
with Paul he was touching handkerchiefs and aprons and releasing them to all the people specifically Paul this was his
58:35
domain and authority of his domain and territory of authority he wasn't saying okay now my
58:43
spiritual Sons and Daughters you also place the handkerchiefs and aprint to your skin and put it on the people to
58:48
your left and your right the Bible says acts 1911 it was specifically Paul because he had high level anointing and
58:54
Authority number one and number two this is how this is the principle of authority this is his
59:01
domain just like the parent does not go into the teacher's classroom and try to do the teacher's job disorder that's not
59:07
the principle of authority so what you need to understand
59:13
is that when you're really in the true ano this is a long teaching today but it's very important when you're in the
59:19
true when you're in the true anointed Church where God has called you to be planted it is like Apostle Peter and his
59:27
shadow the anointing is available for you there it is Flowing to you there
59:33
when you make that decision to be planted that anointing is flowing in your life as you come to church as you
59:41
continually position yourself under the shadow coming online coming to the live streams listening to the the the the
59:47
lives listening to the replays listening to other messages that are posted throughout the week and going back on
59:53
YouTube and listening to them listening to the podcast you're continually positioning yourself
59:58
positioning yourself under the shadow of the anointing and that anointing will hit you and if there is sickness and if
1:00:05
there's oppression the demons have to go the sickness has to
1:00:10
go this is order this is God's way so when you are really positioned W
1:00:18
in God's true anointed church and and where the shadow of the anointing is you
1:00:23
not lacking things you are not lacking prayer you are not lacking prophetic
1:00:28
Direction you God knows what you need it's his way of feeding you everything
1:00:33
you need there directing you prophetically there if you're like what's my calling and it's not released
1:00:39
yet it means it's not time yet it's time to just sit and be still and and let yourself be
1:00:45
transformed focus on serving you know so God can release other things later in
1:00:50
his timing amen but you're not lacking you're not if you in it in the middle of
1:00:56
the week feel like you know you are in such need of such prayer you know you
1:01:02
are so you feel like you're so oppressed or something but actually you're
1:01:07
planted in most cases it's the devil lying you are under the shadow of
1:01:15
anointing don't let the devil lie to you use your Authority reject him resist him
1:01:22
if you're in the middle of an attack position yourself under the sh Shadow watch a video watch a replay pertaining
1:01:29
to something specifically that you need to hear maybe it's the renewing of the mind for example you're having an attack
1:01:34
in the mind maybe one of the how to receive complete deliverance videos if you just
1:01:42
really feel like you're really stuck in a certain situation or maintaining your deliverance there's many videos of that
1:01:48
on my YouTube but on the playlist how to receive and maintain complete deliverance but position yourself there
1:01:55
that's what you need that's the highest level anointing you want the Peter anointing you shouldn't
1:02:01
be going looking for lower level anointings and different things that's out of order go to where the highest
1:02:08
level anointing Authority is there available for you amen and so now I just want to share
1:02:16
like what happens when a person in the church it you know maybe you are planted
1:02:22
at a church God's true anointed church and then another other person is maybe it's a friend is also planted there and
1:02:29
then the friend is just having an attack is is feeling week is going through
1:02:35
something spiritually tough in the middle of the week maybe they call
1:02:42
you so what are you supposed to do like what is the right order well the important thing to know
1:02:50
is the power of the anointing that's available the power of the anointing
1:02:56
that's available and how do we receive that power that's available position yourself so the proper order of what to
1:03:04
do is to be an encourager be an encourager for your friend encourage
1:03:10
them remind them sometimes the Devil comes with so many lies it's hard for a person to remember the truth remind them
1:03:18
the truth of of God's promises remind them the power of the anointing where
1:03:23
they are planted remind them the words that were declared this past Sunday or
1:03:29
maybe on this live on Wednesday for example and that those words were sent to their lives and that word is
1:03:37
working send them a video pertaining to what they they need at a video where uh
1:03:45
released by the church you're planted at so you encourage them here get under the
1:03:51
shadow you just need the anointing to come touch you you know that's the proper order of what to do if someone
1:03:59
comes to you in need when they're in a weak place you can pray father I pray that
1:04:07
and I thank you that you are giving peace to my friend here and we thank you
1:04:14
for your power that's available to us and we thank you that these attacks are
1:04:20
going away and everything but a kind of prayer that's in agreement and in order order and in
1:04:26
unity rather than all of a sudden becoming a a five-fold minister and
1:04:33
issuing uh like walk like trying to walk in authority that's in a place that
1:04:39
isn't really your domain this person is already under the shadow of anointing it's going out of order is the
1:04:46
problem and then and it's also not helping the person
1:04:52
to remember and see God's beautiful ways and the anointing
1:04:58
and power that's available to them so the really like walking in
1:05:04
authority of casting out demons Healing The Sick is going to come more so I mean not more so but
1:05:10
totally outside of where you are planted where people are not receiving they're
1:05:17
not under the shadow of anointing they're not that's when you're an extension of the Shadow you're an
1:05:22
extension of this anointing you're you've you were sitting under the waterfall and you're soaked and you're
1:05:29
going like this to them and they receed the drops whether that's just through the words you speak sharing your
1:05:35
testimony or praying for them in some cases and so they're receiving the the the drops that you flick at them as
1:05:41
you're soaked with the anointing and and then in some cases some depending on the person they may
1:05:48
receive more more anointing and it's more than just a flick but there's even more that God's imparted to them but
1:05:54
that depends on the person's surrender and their calling but um for some people even just
1:05:59
a flick just by the res the residue of being in the anointing is so powerful
1:06:05
and will touch a person and but the purpose is to get them to come under the waterfall is to get them to be to bir
1:06:12
them as a sheep to come be planted where you're planted to receive all they they need to
1:06:18
receive amen okay so I just shared the proper order of of being a sheep but being a
1:06:26
believer in the Kingdom I did mention a little bit earlier how when you
1:06:34
are like honestly operating as a fful minister
1:06:40
like doing the fful ministers roles of teaching of casting out demons that are
1:06:47
higher level or a more a tougher demonic case than really you should be venturing
1:06:53
to deal with when you're doing that it's dangerous spiritually and we have an
1:06:59
example of you know I shared it was very dangerous number one because for the teaching you're going to be judged number two you don't have the grace for
1:07:06
that I want to share this too you know like for my own example my own my own
1:07:13
example God has giving me a Grace as an apostle that what I'm releasing is pure
1:07:18
is Anointed is exactly what God wants to be released he's giving me that Grace he's giving me that the grace to hear
1:07:25
his holy spirit the V his V his true voice and releasing the prophetic
1:07:31
anointing upon me he's giving me that special Grace I did not have that before
1:07:36
I received my calling and before I came under the covering of my spiritual
1:07:41
father Prophet Dr jvy I didn't have that I was not wise I was not prophetic at
1:07:47
all that's where I used to be and about 8 years ago now when
1:07:56
I received my calling and then received the grace upon my life and started to
1:08:03
receive the anointing of impartation through my spiritual father I also received so much wisdom through my
1:08:09
spiritual father so much so much and this day and so it's been eight years
1:08:16
now eight years of so many days of the week receive
1:08:25
receiving wisdom receiving teaching receiving equipping through my spiritual
1:08:34
father and my spiritual father cannot do that for a lot of people for hardly any
1:08:40
people but it's because of this calling that God's given me he's given me this
1:08:48
grace to receive so much of this wisdom and equipping through my spiritual
1:08:54
father and my spiritual father is a prophet not just any prophet he is at the highest level in the spiritual
1:09:00
realm of a prophet and servant of God like in terms of as we're talking about the kingdom of God and government he is
1:09:06
at the highest level and he has the fruits to show it I've never seen fruits
1:09:12
that looked like the book of Acts like I have in my spiritual father and in his
1:09:17
ministry in his church that I visited many times I've never seen so many lives
1:09:24
come to Jesus and also be surrendered and equipped and so many people that are now they were sick with cancer then they
1:09:31
were healed when they came to his church of cancer and now they're Apostles and they've healed other people of cancer
1:09:38
with God's by God's power moving through them just shocking fruits like this that I just haven't seen anywhere else he's
1:09:44
been in Ministry for more than 40 years he's been ministering at his church and
1:09:52
has so many spiritual sons and daughters so many spiritual sons and daughters who are Apostles and Prophets and evangelists and pastors and teachers
1:09:58
also ministering different times in his church and um also leaders of branches
1:10:06
many many branches all over the nation and Beyond he's also been asked by so
1:10:11
many governmental leaders in different nations mostly in Africa he's been
1:10:17
sought after for Spiritual advice he is so
1:10:23
wise so wise and just what God has revealed him of of
1:10:30
what of this new wine of of these things that God is restoring now is end time
1:10:36
Revival and so I just wanted to give an example to you that I just don't come
1:10:43
here number one I don't come here with um old wine Seminary school like
1:10:49
Doctrine number two I don't come here just with like what
1:10:55
God showed me alone you know no I've gone the biblical
1:11:02
way of receiving equipping and teaching through the fful
1:11:07
ministry through a true Prophet for many years wisdom after
1:11:15
wisdom he is released to me I I I would be lost without that equipping and
1:11:22
wisdom that I received from God through my spiritual
1:11:28
father and it's a lot it's a lot it's been about eight years of my life
1:11:36
dedicated to receiving this wisdom not my own way not just God just
1:11:45
God and me but the biblical way through the fivefold ministry through someone
1:11:51
who's gone before me for decades
1:11:57
God's perfect biblical way so we don't get confused by the angel of Light that we don't get confused with feelings or
1:12:03
we don't get confused with so much of this other old wine stuff that's out there God's biblical way of receiving
1:12:10
equipping through the fful ministry that's what I've received now for eight years
1:12:17
and I just share that this is this is how one can know one can be safe and
1:12:24
this is why one should only follow the shepherd's voice and the in the church
1:12:29
pastor Shepherd just following that voice just trusting that voice for your
1:12:34
spiritual food and Direction
1:12:41
spiritually there will be other people in the church this is just going to
1:12:46
happen there will be other people in the church that will go against this order
1:12:51
and you have to be aware of it there will be some people that have good intentions and they really think they're
1:12:58
hearing from God but they are completely deceived by the angel of Light just for the purpose of damaging other believers
1:13:06
confusing other believers leading other believers astray that the devil
1:13:11
disguising himself as an angel of Light has this plan in the church to puff up people and make them
1:13:20
think they're hearing God about this and make them think that they are a fful minister or make them think you need to
1:13:27
counsel this person you need to pray for this person um you need to cast demons out of this person out of order like in
1:13:34
the church this will happen this will happen and so you have to be so aware of
1:13:41
this that when you see this you know exactly what's going on you don't get
1:13:47
confused by it you don't get deceived by it there are people with good intentions that are just deceived by the angel of
1:13:53
Light and then there are also some with malici intentions they have pride and they they
1:14:01
want to take advantage of these believers who many of them don't have the wisdom yet haven't
1:14:08
grown yet many of them are just just wanting one-on-one prayer and that one-on-one constant mentorship and
1:14:14
counsel so much and they pray on that and they go after them and they build
1:14:21
their own Ministries within their own Ministry Within
1:14:27
within the ministry that they're planted which is out of order and is not unity
1:14:35
and is really damaging and detrimental to the Sheep so you have to be aware of
1:14:40
this this is a warning that this happens you H it won't just happen one time it
1:14:46
happens this is one of the devil's big schemes so be aware of this that you're
1:14:52
only listening to The Shepherd's voice that you know God's ways and God's order
1:14:58
so that when you see something out of order you know so you're aware so you don't go out of order but you just stay
1:15:08
focused amen I also want to share you know I was just sharing how it's
1:15:14
dangerous to you know do the role of a fful minister for example when you're not a fful minister it's also dangerous
1:15:22
with casting out demons when like tougher demonic cases or even just well for
1:15:29
one when you're trying to C when you're casting out demons were with in people that are planted in the church that's
1:15:36
going out of order that's going to be dangerous because it's out of order another example is ministering like
1:15:44
literally showing up places and ministering like to a group of people
1:15:49
and casting out demons before God has sent you to do that before God's timing
1:15:59
prematurely and also thirdly the dangerous thing when it comes to casting
1:16:04
out the dangerous way one of the ways you can be casting demons out of order that is dangerous the third way is not walking
1:16:11
in wisdom and just kind of having this motive that you just want to cast demons out so badly that you
1:16:19
just go for it all the time when instead of listening to the Holy Spirit number one number two
1:16:25
sometimes there's right from the get-go you'll know this it's a really tough demonic case maybe this person's been
1:16:31
involved with a lot of Witchcraft maybe this person has made a a covenant with this uh of suicide you know like you you
1:16:40
can know right away when the person is telling you if it's a more complex uh demonic case and this could
1:16:47
be higher level demons you should not even try to cast a demon out you should bring them under the shadow of the
1:16:53
anointing so the anointing can deal with it painfree you're not being harmed and
1:16:59
also the person's not being harmed you know because like without the anointing or without the anointing that's needed a
1:17:06
demon can be staying in a person knowing that they they won't they can't they won't leave because you don't have the
1:17:13
authority over them and they could be hurting the person they can be just manifesting the person and hurting the
1:17:20
person that's how it can be dangerous as well so I'm going to give an example of this that we see in the word acts
1:17:27
1911 God did extraordinary Miracles through Paul so that even handkerchiefs
1:17:32
and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left
1:17:38
them some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the
1:17:43
name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed they would say in the name of the Jesus whom Paul preaches
1:17:49
I command you to come out seven sons of ska a Jewish Chief priest were doing this one day the evil spirit answered
1:17:56
them Jesus I know and Paul I know about but who are you then the man who had the
1:18:01
evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all he gave them such a
1:18:07
beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding so the demon saw that
1:18:14
this demon would have R higher level demon and he knew Paul because Paul was
1:18:20
walking in extraordinary Miracles with a high level anointing so he recognized Paul's Authority that when Paul exerted
1:18:26
his authority commanded him to leave he knew he had to leave he recognized Jesus
1:18:31
he knew when Jesus commanded him to leave he had to leave but this guy he
1:18:37
says who are you I don't I don't see Authority that you have over me and you
1:18:42
you don't have it and since you don't have it I can now because you've gone out of
1:18:48
order you've gone out of order doing something that God did not call you to do you're going against the spiritual
1:18:54
laws now I have the authority to cause you harm that's how it works in the spiritual realm we are given free will
1:19:01
we go God's way or the devil's way we go God's way and we are blessed we are
1:19:06
protected and we receive Miracles and we go glory to glory we go the devil's way
1:19:13
and we expose ourselves to the devil we are giving him authority to attack us
1:19:18
it's a spiritual law it's a spiritual law so this applies to everything in life so and it applies to casting out
1:19:25
demons when God didn't call you to do that in the area God didn't call you to do
1:19:31
that you were stepping outside of God's Will and God's order and his grace and
1:19:38
so you were allowing the Devil to attack you that's how it works it's a spiritual
1:19:45
law and principle in the spiritual realm amen hallelujah and so lastly I
1:19:52
just want to share this verse John 10:27 my sheep listen to my
1:19:59
voice I know them and they follow me my sheep listen to my voice I know them and
1:20:05
they follow me so we have a Shepherd in heaven Our Father Our Father in Heaven
1:20:11
Is Our Shepherd but also God gives us a pastor or leader of a church who is also
1:20:16
called a Shepherd a shepherd on on this Earth who's called to be a spiritual leader and my sheep list listen to my
1:20:25
voice so you should listen to The Shepherd's voice and only the shepherd's voice only whom God called you to listen
1:20:30
to I know them and they follow me so this is God's way and so once again I
1:20:37
want to just really as a Shepherd I want my the Sheep
1:20:42
to always be safe and protected and so you really have to be aware that within
1:20:48
every Church within every healthy thriving pure church since the doors are
1:20:54
open there will also be those who have wrong intentions there will also be
1:21:01
those who have good intentions but are deceived by the angel of Light and in
1:21:09
both cases there can be people trying to be Shepherds or trying
1:21:14
to bring you under their wing um Mentor you um in some cases maybe they want to
1:21:21
feel spiritually important it makes them feel good or they want to point to others look at
1:21:27
these people who are listening to me and I'm counseling them and I'm praying for them and I'm casting demons out of them
1:21:32
and everything you need to be aware of this so whether it's in person whether it's online whether
1:21:39
it's people you encounter at in person or whether it's people who maybe reach
1:21:45
out to you online or you see online you need to have this maturity in you this
1:21:51
mature just wisdom in you to know that these are the Dynamics of the church
1:21:57
that this is inevitable and just to walk in wisdom and to be innocent as a dove
1:22:04
but wise as a serpent to not be so quick to let people in close but to really
1:22:11
walk in wisdom to look at fruits and to be led by the Holy Spirit according to
1:22:19
what he's speaking the wisdom he's releasing to you through the church you're planted in walk in that wisdom
1:22:26
being led by the Holy Spirit of who to bring in close you know to make sure
1:22:33
that that who you're bringing in close is not detrimental to your spiritual health because the Bible says Bad
1:22:40
Company corrupts good morals so this is something to take so seriously that you're only bringing in close those who
1:22:49
God is calling you to bring in close those will be ones with good fruits who
1:22:54
are surrendered to God who are not just saying how much they love Jesus and how surrendered they are to God but are
1:23:01
showing it with their actions are being obedient to the the the teachings that are
1:23:10
released the the new wine the order they're being obedient to these this
1:23:17
these words of God amen amen hallelujah Hal hallelujah
1:23:25
thank you Jesus thank you Jesus praise God praise
1:23:30
God well I want to declare over all of you right now thank you Jesus I see I
1:23:36
see that God is releasing so much wisdom and has made you to grow so much today I I
1:23:45
feel and see the Holy Spirit just doing such a quickening moving in supersonic
1:23:51
speed to mature you because his love for you to mature you in the area of wisdom
1:23:57
and your spiritual eyesight because I know a lot of you have gone through things I
1:24:03
know you've been deceived in the past and I understand more than you know um
1:24:09
and and I'm very God has put in this put this passion in me especially as a Shepherd but he's even walked me through
1:24:17
things in the past where I I have such a heart and compassion for
1:24:23
you to not be deceived and to be safe
1:24:30
spiritually nine years ago I think it was like before I stepped into my calling
1:24:36
and had and then received the spiritual F my spiritual father who just releases
1:24:42
so much wisdom in my life before that I didn't have wisdom I didn't have a Shepherd I didn't have an anointed
1:24:48
Shepherd so I wasn't anybody special I was like everyone else you know I did not have
1:24:55
wisdom back then and so I remember one
1:25:00
time there was there was this person
1:25:06
and the way they spoke the way they spoke just seemed like they were so
1:25:15
spiritual it seemed like they were so close to God it seemed
1:25:22
like they just knew so much more than me but they weren't they weren't a fivefold
1:25:28
minister they weren't planted somewhere and they were just saying they
1:25:34
didn't really even have a home they were just saying God's calling me to go here now God's
1:25:39
calling me to go here now and God's calling me to evangelize here now and but back then just because of the
1:25:48
way this person spoke seeming so spiritual and me who was
1:25:54
like just real like I was never trying to portray myself as like spiritual or
1:26:00
anything and like I was just real you know and so I'm hearing this person talk about
1:26:07
how like the way they're speaking they just seem so spiritual and so much more spiritually advanced than me but back
1:26:15
then I didn't have wisdom so I didn't know like it doesn't matter how they're speaking but are they in
1:26:23
order are they going according to God's principles do they have a covering are they planted somewhere do you know do
1:26:30
they have a spiritual father or mother I didn't I didn't know any of that and so they're see they're talking like wow
1:26:39
they must be so much closer to God than me they must know so much more spiritually so I just listen to this
1:26:46
person and just took in what they were saying like and
1:26:56
at the time I I was just had no clue that this person was being was truly being led by the angel of Light truly
1:27:02
being led by the angel of Light and it was by God's grace I was protected I was
1:27:11
protected I mean it's so serious and so dangerous like the way the angel of
1:27:17
Light can could manipulate you through people it could take you really off course you know and just make you lost
1:27:25
and so I thank God for his grace for protecting me I think the person just ended up like leaving town and so the
1:27:33
close relationship didn't remain praise God but just years later I mean walk
1:27:40
just learning I would learn so much through my spiritual father about the true biblical Kingdom principles and
1:27:48
about hearing God's voice and God's ways and everything and and then I looked back and I saw wow
1:27:54
this person was completely being led by the angel of Light and here I was
1:28:01
thinking it was God and that he I was seeing him as a leader I was seeing him
1:28:07
as a leader in my life and um I thank God for his
1:28:12
protection
1:28:17
so this is why God is so good to give his principles and to give us leaders so
1:28:24
that we can know this is right you know if I had met this person now I would
1:28:31
have known exactly what was going on you know so I just share that to just give an example of maybe you have gone
1:28:39
through that in the past or this could happen in the future make sure you you
1:28:44
know the shepherd's voice don't be wooed or wowed by someone just like sounding
1:28:50
impressive with how they speak make sure you're listen listening to your Shepherd only and following God's order and
1:28:59
principles amen amen amen how does one discern to know
1:29:07
if it's the enemy coming as an angel of Light well
1:29:12
um for like when it comes to you hearing
1:29:18
hearing God's voice and everything it's it's just important really what I've talked today is one of
1:29:24
the big ways to discern like you would have this discernment now like
1:29:29
um maybe you have this strong feeling to announce that you are a fful minister
1:29:36
that you've believed this is you've had this feeling for a long time but you you've received
1:29:42
this wisdom this biblical wisdom that's not the way but it is it can seem like
1:29:48
not a bad thing like announcing this is my this is what God has said that I am but that would be the angel of
1:29:55
light when there is humility true humility and and you planted and
1:30:02
receiving this wisdom you won't be deceived by the angel of
1:30:07
Light the angel of Light people usually deceived by when there is when there is
1:30:13
pride the angel of Light will usually tell you speak this thing on God's behalf and
1:30:21
do this thing on God's behalf and if you will humble yourself and
1:30:27
realize I do not want to be out of order I do not want to just be quick to to
1:30:34
prophesy this and it might not be God I mean God has not called me to to
1:30:39
prophesy directional things that's for the five-fold offices when you Pro all
1:30:45
believers we are all called to prophesy but it's to edify the Believers it's supposed to be encouragement it's
1:30:51
supposed to encourage believers not speak directional words because you don't have the grace
1:30:59
for that you don't have the grace for that amen so that it's the grace is with the
1:31:07
five full ministers so the way the the big answer
1:31:13
of how to not be deceived by the angel of Light is to humble yourself truly humble yourself and become a
1:31:19
disciple to learn God's principles and his ways I've taught on so many things
1:31:26
like how to hear the voice of God so that's a big one where people tend to be deceived by the angel of Light and I
1:31:33
have this teaching several of them I believe on my YouTube you can search how to hear God's voice and so to be this
1:31:41
disciple and to learn through this equipping where you know okay this is really God's word and God's ways because
1:31:48
I'm receiving it through the trusted leader who has the grace who's not just speaking on their own it's really coming
1:31:54
from God so now you you receive that wisdom and now you can discern now you
1:32:02
can you can hear something you can feel something and you'll know oh that was the angel of Light prior to the wisdom
1:32:09
I've received I would have thought that was God but now because I've received the wisdom I know this is the angel of
1:32:15
Light this feeling that I have this feeling to do
1:32:20
something amen so I'm going to declare and pray over all of you right now thank you
