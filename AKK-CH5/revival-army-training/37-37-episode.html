today you shall today learn how to defeat the Devil once and for
0:07
all Hallelujah I'm going to share with you really how to be this amazing
0:13
champion of God and man I could probably te speak for a long time teach on this
0:20
but I'm going to give you a simple key that's going to just unlock
0:27
this Victory that's going to lead to this Victory today the Bible says in
0:32
Ephesians 4:10 he who descended is the very same as he who also has ascended High Above All The Heavens that he his
0:39
presence might find all things that is the whole universe and this is the Amplified version and his gifts to the
0:45
church this is Jesus we're talking about his gifts to the church were varied and he himself appointed some as Apostles
0:53
some as prophets some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers and he did
1:00
this to fully equip and perfect the
1:06
Saints God's people for works of service to build up the body of Christ the
1:13
church until we all reach Oneness in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of
1:19
God growing spiritually to become a mature
1:27
believer reaching to the measure of the fullness of Christ manifesting his
1:33
spiritual completeness and exercising our spiritual gifts in unity so that we are no longer
1:42
children parentheses spiritually immature tossed back and forth like
1:49
ships on a stormy sea and carried out by every wind of Shifting Doctrine by the cunning and trickery of men by the
1:54
deceitful scheme of people ready to do anything keywords the purpose of God giving the
2:01
fivefold ministry the apostles and Prophets MERS pastors and
2:07
teachers is to fully equip and perfect the Saints so that the Believers the
2:13
whole church grow spiritually to become a mature believer reaching to the measure of the
2:19
fullness of Christ so that we are no longer children spiritually
2:27
immature Ephesians 4 this is Ephesians 410 through1 14 that I read you you can
2:34
keep reading till 16 there's many key words here maturing grow no longer
2:41
children no longer immature equipped built up able to do works of service
2:46
because you're no longer immature but you are now mature
2:51
Hallelujah so um no by the way no wonder the devil uh has worked so hard to get
2:59
believer Bel to reject Apostles and prophets from the fivefold ministry
3:04
which according to Ephesians 2:20 they are the foundation of the body of Christ with Chief with Jesus as the Chief
3:09
Cornerstone so no wonder because the devil knows that people will not be able to do
3:18
works when they do not receive this equipping from the fivefold
3:23
ministry what are the works that we're talking about well we're talking about the works against the devil's Kingdom
3:30
The Works that defeat the devil's Kingdom and Advance God's kingdom that's
3:35
the works that we're talking about and the only thing that the devil
3:40
has only ammunition he has are his lies and the only way that he can have
3:48
victory in this area where people will fall for his lies is when Believers stay
3:56
babies because to be babies in Christ really
4:03
just means that you are lacking revelation of God's word you can
4:11
have the word of God you can have the Bible and read it a lot but you need
4:16
Revelation new wine Revelation that comes from the five-fold ministry equipping teaching and equipping
4:24
especially Apostles prophets teachers they're the ones that have the special Grace for teaching and
4:32
maturing teaching the deeper things of the spirit moving beyond the milk I'm
4:39
giving it away right right away I'm teaching you already how you can defeat
4:44
the Devil once and for all grow up
4:50
mature mature decide to
4:56
mature because it's a choice to mat sure it's a choice to use the wisdom that's
5:04
been released to you the equipping that's been released to you it's a choice to Value it to apply it to listen
5:15
again and again to meditate on it so that you aren't just hearing a message
5:22
and hearing another message and hearing another message but you are taking the
5:27
message and putting it in you so that you are that's how you are
5:34
equipped the the fifel ministry your spiritual leader spiritual leaders they
5:40
they release the teaching but it's up to you to turn that teaching into equipping
5:47
to turn that teaching into something that will change you and transform you
5:53
you have to take it seriously this is how you defeat the Devil once and for all is to
6:01
mature to decide to mature how do you mature
6:08
well you know if you even if you like just search do a search in the Bible and you're looking up I was doing this
6:14
actually early I was just like I was searching in the scripture just doing a search of verses that have to do with
6:19
maturity maturity the one that is I mean the
6:25
passage that's containing the most about maturity is Ephesians
6:32
4 10-16 that I just read to you
6:38
and the what this verse what this passage is saying is that Jesus gave to
6:44
the church the five phone Ministry Apostles prophets evangelist
6:49
pastors and teachers for the equipping so that the Believers would be mature
6:55
would be equipped so you want to have victory
7:00
over the devil you need to decide to grow up you need to decide to mature how
7:05
do you mature well you this is God's maturing system this is God's equipping
7:11
to bring from baby to maturity system is the fold
7:17
Ministry and remember Apostles and Prophets are the foundation of the church it says in Ephesians
7:24
220 with Christ Jesus as a Chief Cornerstone so found found ation
7:30
bringing maturity you have to accept Apostles prophets you have to accept
7:36
instead of mock instead of ridicule instead of reject instead of Judge you
7:43
have to accept the anointing you accept
7:49
honor is the anointing that will work for you the anointing coming through Apostles for example I'll give myself
7:56
for an example teaching the teaching and equipping that anointing that comes
8:01
through me for example you have to honor respect value that anointed
8:09
teaching for that to work for you for that anointing for that equipping to
8:14
work in you so this is this is a big one is to
8:22
really value this equiping that you're receiving if you can simply value that
8:27
equipment and this is this is a big thing that God has called me to is to share how simple the gospel is how
8:36
simple being a Believer is how simple being a child of God is how simple the
8:42
kingdom of God is the ways of the Kingdom they are simple but religion complicates things
8:49
so people are ignoring the simple way and they are choosing the religious
8:54
complicated way and so they never find Abundant Life they never never find true
9:00
intimacy with Jesus they never find um maturity in
9:06
Christ right and so this is the a really simple what I'm sharing with you right
9:13
now but if you can value that equipping that God is given you through the fire
9:19
phold Ministry so meaning like to be at an anointed Church to be planted at
9:24
anointed church you can be planted virtually for example at fivefold church we have people planted from 147 Nations
9:31
so they're attending Sunday services at all hours of the night and day if they can attend it because the time zone
9:37
during the middle of the night they'll attend they'll watch the replay but you
9:43
you need to be planted at an anointed Church five-fold Ministry Church meaning a church that believes in this Doctrine
9:50
this true new wine doctrine of the five-fold ministry it does not mean that there needs to be all five-fold offices
9:56
present eventually as God like at fivefold church this is why God has given us this name is
10:02
because you as you can see in Ephesians 4:10 through6 this is the foundation of
10:10
the church the foundation of how the Believers can defeat the Devil be
10:16
equipped and be powerful vessels of God this is the foundation we can't neglect
10:22
this part and then when we neglect this part but we if we neglect this part we miss out on so much and that's why so
10:28
many Believers are missing out on so so much they're missing out on the anointing they're missing out on being mature they're missing out on receiving
10:33
Miracles healing and deliverance honestly it's very simple missing God's
10:38
Foundation of equipping and releasing impartation of
10:44
anointing and releasing Miracles so that people can be delivered to be able
10:51
to actually walk as a Believer without Shackles on them so that they can really mature
10:57
Hallelujah um so but you don't have to have all of the five-fold offices there
11:02
at the church that's not what it means eventually at five-fold Church my spiritual father's Church Prophet Dr J Davy he is the he is the leader of the
11:11
church so his office is a prophet but he operates in a pastoral gift as the leader of the church the shepherd and
11:18
then he has God has anointed led him to anoint several Apostles some prophets
11:26
some evangelists pastors and teachers at his church I've been there I've met
11:31
them I've talked to an apostle who was healed of cancer at his church as he
11:37
after he prayed for her and then as time went by she was called by God to be an
11:42
apostle so then she was anointed to be an apostle as time went on and now she has prayed for people who had cancer and
11:48
God has used her to heal people hallelujah so anyways at his church there's all five-fold offices and they
11:56
like throughout the week for example different services in the week There's there's there's Apostle ministering
12:01
sometimes there's there's teachers ministering sometimes another Prophet ministering sometimes so um like that's
12:07
how five-fold church will look as time goes by five 5f Church in La that's how it will look as time goes by but this
12:14
new wine that God is bringing this revival that God has brought it takes time it's built we're building such a
12:21
massive skyscraper in the spiritual realm in terms of the ministry of 5f church and so if you researched how long
12:28
it took to build a skyscraper you would find it took the foundation to build the
12:34
foundation I mean takes a lot longer than a smaller building so
12:39
anyways all that to say I wanted to explain what what I mean by this by
12:45
finding a a church that Embraces the fivefold ministry it means accepting
12:50
Ephesians 41:16 accepting that this is God's foundational way of equipping the
12:56
Believers of how to do ministry and to embrace all five-fold offices um and so
13:02
when God starts a church for example like fulfill church it's it's can start with an apostle and then as time goes by
13:09
God pours out anoints when people are ready to walk in that calling he anoints
13:15
other fful ministers um so when you are planted at
13:21
a true anointed Church where God's fful Ministry is accepted is is
13:27
operating this is the the biggest part of of
13:34
maturing and being equipped for victory constant victory over the devil there's teachings that are being released
13:41
prophetically regularly that God knows you need now and you need to decide to
13:49
Value those teachings with all your heart you know recognize that the most important thing in this world is to obey
13:56
God to serve God and so therefore that means
14:03
that growing from being a baby believer to mature believer
14:09
that's necessary in order to obey God daily in order to have victory over the
14:15
devil in order to fulfill your purpose and so it's very important you recognize
14:21
the how this is the foundation of everything this is the foundation of you having Victory this is the foundation of
14:27
you growing is being at the right Church being planted at the right Church where you're
14:33
getting the spiritual food equipping you need and then valuing
14:40
it with all your heart so that you can actually
14:45
grow amen so that's number one and now I'm just going to um share
14:53
with you um some basics of being a
14:59
believer a child of God and these Basics are things that I teach
15:07
a lot I remind you you of a lot but
15:13
these Basics I'm going to share with you are really milk and they are they are just such an
15:20
important part of your daily walk like you you what I'm about to share with you these Basics these basic
15:30
truths that you need to be equipped with to defeat the lies of the devil you need
15:35
to be carrying them like your your armor of God like the belt of truth it's like
15:42
the belt of truth that that needs to be around you these this is like I'm sharing with
15:48
you the belt of Truth like aspects of the belt of Truth you need to be equipped with the truth to be able to
15:56
discern the lies of the devil reject the lies of the devil devil defeat the Devil
16:02
because remember his biggest scheme his only ammo are lies all right so what I'm
16:09
sharing you I'm going to share I'm going to go through these these basic truths that you need to be carrying with you every day these are Basics these are the
16:17
for these are milk a lot of you you be like yeah I know this but many of you
16:22
are not are not putting on that belt of truth that the Bible talks about how you
16:28
need to be put putting on your armor your armor of God you need to be
16:34
putting that on every day um many of you are are you know you you know these things but it's like the Bel of Truth is
16:41
in the closet and if someone asks you a question
16:46
like you know what is the truth about God in this area in this area you know you can go in the closet if the
16:53
conversation happens oh yeah yeah like I know this like yeah yeah here you you see here's my build of Truth
16:59
but when the Devil Comes sneakily when you're not expecting
17:06
it you don't have time to go in the closet to grab the Bel of Truth you need
17:11
to have it on you you need to be quick you need to be quick to snatch that lie
17:17
out of your head you discern it fast you reject it because if you're not doing that it's
17:26
like you're giving the devil a foothold by inter raining that
17:31
lie amen okay so I'm going to go over these different aspects of truths of the
17:37
that that to make up the belt of Truth these are basic truths okay number
17:44
one God loves you so much he loves you so much that he sent
17:53
his son to die for you his son who was perfect and sinless
17:59
and I know we we hear that so many times so sometimes we don't like like let it enter our heart and and
18:07
meditate on it and have revelation of it we just hear it so many times it becomes
18:12
like religion rather than Revelation but I'm going to encourage you to meditate
18:18
on this right now God loves you so much that he that the only way you could be
18:23
saved the only way you could be saved from eternity in Hell and Hell on Earth too
18:30
is if this sacrifice of his son was made and he he did that just for you if you
18:36
were the only person in this world he would he did it he would have done it he's done it that's how it is like in
18:42
the spiritual realm his love for you is more than all the people that ever
18:48
showed you love combined in one times a million his love cannot be comprehended
18:56
his love is I mean even if people testify of dying and going to heaven or
19:01
seeing Jesus face to face and my spiritual father even when before his
19:06
ministry um expanded so wildly and he he he was so anointed and miracles started
19:12
happening everywhere there was a time a Divine appointment where Jesus appeared to him and it was half of his his upper
19:19
half of his Jesus's body he appeared to him he was holding keys and he held out
19:26
held the keys out in front of him like like this and um there there was tons of
19:32
keys and all of these keys on each key had a different religious name and my
19:37
spiritual father Prophet ji he said that he knew some of those names like some of them were names of church
19:43
denominations so he knew some of those names and others he never heard of before but all of these keys they were
19:50
representing religious bondage religion and Jesus shook the keys and he
19:57
said I'm giving you the keys to unlock my people from religious
20:06
bondage and he smiled in that moment and
20:13
vanished and but the smile that my spiritual father described was
20:18
like the most amazing sight he's ever seen the most amazing love he's ever
20:23
seen in his life and I just I just share that is
20:29
like for you to to just start pondering meditating on God's amazing
20:38
love you need to get that in you in your belt of Truth you I mean this is going
20:46
to involve work this is this is going to involve intention to meditate on this truth this is going to involve you
20:52
pondering on God's love just thinking about God's love renewing your mind of
20:58
it's going to take take you going into the word of God and reading about his love and bringing to remembrance
21:04
meditating on scripture about his love it's going to take intention it's not going to come naturally it's going to take intention remembering how God shown
21:11
his love to you bringing that to your remembrance meditating on that um how he opened up your eyes to his love uh the
21:18
things he's done for you the grace he's shown you it's going to take that intention to bring to remembrance and
21:25
meditate on this revelation of God's love that he's giving you and if you haven't experienced sons
21:32
of Revelation like that you need to go in the word and seek him you need to seek his presence come to 5f church
21:40
flourish conferences these live streams for example seek where his power is
21:45
moving where he reveals himself where he comes in power and manifests himself so
21:51
mightily and tangibly comes so powerfully where you can't not be
21:58
changed you can't not have your eyes open up to his love Hallelujah um and so there's so many
22:05
people who are forgetting this truth and that's what the biggest reason why
22:10
they're being defeated is because the enemy is coming with lies once in a
22:15
while once in a while he's coming with lies and he's just saying things like
22:21
you're not good enough or remember your past remember the horrible things you did and um you're lazy and you don't
22:28
have a good enough heart and you aren't grateful enough and you're impatient and
22:33
yada yada yada He he'll just come he'll come and it's not your thoughts it's the devil attacking your mind
22:42
and if you can simply be equipped with this aspect basic
22:50
foundational milky aspect of God's truths in your belt of
22:56
Truth you will never be be giving into the devil's lies
23:02
you will never be deceived you will be like that's the
23:08
devil the opposite is true God loves me so much you
23:13
know quickly you know you won't you won't have to take an hour and be like
23:19
Oh yeah this might be the I guess this is probably the devil quickly you can
23:26
know I don't think so devil you can't deceive me I'm no baby
23:32
anymore I know God's love for me you can't deceive me in that area anymore
23:37
I'm not a baby anymore nice try you know this is one of the biggest Basics you
23:44
have to the basics of God's truths that you got to get in you it's
23:51
the one of the biggest schemes of the devil is to be speaking that you're not
23:57
good enough that you're not lovable um that God's disappointed in you it says
24:04
Romans 8:34 who then is the one who condemns no one Christ Jesus who died
24:12
more than that who was raised to life is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us it also says in the
24:18
word there is no condemnation no notada zero no absolutely no condemnation for
24:26
those who are in Christ Jesus so here we have this truth Jesus is not
24:34
condemning us rather he has Mercy he has Grace he has understanding he understands that you
24:40
are not perfect he's not expecting you to be perfect he if you will just come to him and repent he will forgive you
24:48
and wipe away all of your sins in a second it's the opposite of condemning
24:54
is what God is doing for you he convicts but when he convicts he convicts with love not condemnation he convicts
25:01
because he wants the best for you and he knows that if he doesn't convict you he's letting you go astray so in his
25:07
love he corrects in his love he convicts but that's not to be confused with condemnation there is none of that in
25:15
Christ the opposite so if you start to be hearing all of these shameful voices
25:20
guilt voices thoughts in your head you got to just simply know this is the
25:26
devil period do not entertain those thoughts this is the baby Christian way that God is
25:33
asking you to get out of this is the what I'm saying about how it's a choice to mature you know you know this Truth by
25:41
now you know it you know it you've received revelation of it you you know it so now it's time to apply that
25:49
truth to not just have that truth but do nothing with it and live this double
25:56
life telling others Jesus never condemns you but believing the lies of the devil
26:01
and feeling pity and sorry for yourself that's being immature
26:08
spiritually It also says that um Jesus is at the right hand of God and is also
26:15
interceding for us Jesus is praying for
26:24
you Jesus desires your victory more than you do Jesus is cheering you on Jesus is
26:34
the general we are soldiers in Christ and we're all on the same
26:44
team Jesus is on your team Jesus is cheering you on Jesus is your coach your
26:51
personal trainer he wants you to win more than you do and so so if you're ever feeling like
27:01
you're just having an off day right you're you know maybe you made a mistake
27:06
or maybe just your feelings are feeling fleshly like your
27:12
feel like your you're you're not naturally feeling grateful you're not naturally feeling
27:18
patient you're not naturally feeling joyful but yet you
27:23
know you know that you you should be grateful you should be patient you should be joyful but your
27:31
feelings just aren't naturally there you see many people when they have when they
27:36
experience that they think that they believe the devil's lies the devil now is going to come and say many times he's
27:43
going to come and say h your heart is not good for you have so much to be
27:50
grateful for yet you're not really appreciating fully instead you're you're
27:55
longing for the promise so much and you're focused so much on that and you're not being grateful for what you
28:02
have and and you should be full of joy people would just long to have people
28:10
are longing to have what you have like you know you should be ashamed of yourself God is disappointed like the
28:16
devil will those thoughts went into your mind sometimes that's the devil that is the devil that is the devil
28:24
lying remember Jesus is praying for you he is cheering
28:31
you on he wants you to have Victory so why is he going to be going against you
28:36
why is he going to be pushing you down why is he going to be condemning you he's not he's not this is what the word
28:43
says and this doesn't make sense why he would push you down when he's praying for you and cheering you on
28:49
Hallelujah I mean this is really basic what I'm sharing but it's
28:55
so profound because so many people are not it's profoundly simple it people miss
29:02
the basics and they're defeated people are are honestly people
29:10
people can be and sometimes this happens to me sometimes people will be writing some people emailing like help me I'm
29:16
struggling with this area um you know and people are thinking it's something
29:22
complex people are thinking like they need me to pray for them there's some
29:27
comp ated key that needs to be unlocked in this situation for this breakthrough to come and honestly a lot of the time
29:35
it's simply that they need to put on their belt of Truth and use the truth
29:40
that's been given them and just apply it actually you know be spiritual and
29:49
Discerning of these lies of the devil and reject them it as simple as that
30:00
Hallelujah it says in Exodus 14:14 the Lord will fight for you you need only to
30:06
be still the Lord will fight for you and this is just one scripture of many that speak about how Jesus is fighting for
30:14
you he is fighting your battles for you he is defending you he is protecting
30:22
you he will vindicate you he is giving you overwhelming coming Victory all of
30:30
these things I just said right now they're all in the word of God they're all in the Bible I just read one scripture to you it's all in the word
30:38
right so this is the other okay this is the other spiritual truth one of the basics
30:45
that you have to get in you and put on your belt of Truth every day you are in
30:51
a spiritual war oh yes we know this every Christian
30:58
knows this but so many are are just are just leaving that truth in their
31:06
closet they're they're not remembering that they're in a spiritual war and the
31:12
main way of the spiritual war is in the
31:18
mind it says in the Bible take captive every thought make it obedient to
31:25
Christ that's and it's it says that the war we are in is not of flesh and blood
31:31
but it's in the spiritual realm it's against principalities it's against
31:36
forces of evil it's it's against um all the Demonic
31:43
Powers um but we have the power to demolish
31:48
every argument that goes against the knowledge of
31:53
Christ so the Bible actually speaks so clearly that this Spirit the War we're in is spiritual not
32:00
physical the main area of the spiritual war is going to be in our mind the main
32:05
area of this war in our mind is having to do with lies lies of the
32:11
devil so you know you you need to remember renew your mind every day I'm
32:18
in a spiritual war Jesus is giving me Victory if I play
32:25
my part if I put on my of truth I got to be protected with the Bel of truth I got
32:31
to be equipped with the Bel of truth if I do what his word is saying if I take cap of these thoughts that don't align
32:37
with with Jesus's truths I have to reject the lies of the devil to resist
32:43
the devil's lies I have to submit to God submit to the word of God I have to be
32:48
surrendered I have to be obedient but you just do those you just do those things and you got Victory overwhelming
32:56
Victory Jesus gives you Hal Hallelujah all right but you're in a spiritual war you got to remember you're cuz sometimes
33:02
we can just be like yeah I have the victory in Christ but forget that we're
33:08
in a war it's not like you're on the podium every day wearing the crown of
33:15
Victory like time to party and relax no you're in the spiritual war and like
33:21
every day God's given you a crown of Victory but there's another battle the
33:26
next day and it it might not be every single day there's a battle no but we are continually in this war so we got to
33:34
be ready to be good soldiers in Christ as Paul says we are called to be good
33:43
soldiers so that means we got to make sure we're putting on our armor on we got to make sure we got our weapons the
33:48
sword of the spirit the word of God so that's going in alignment with a Bel of Truth you remember these truths and you
33:57
go to war with the word of God which is the truth what I've been sharing with you today is the revelation of the word
34:05
of God and so the lies come from the devil but you take the the sword of the
34:12
spirit which is the word of God and you defeat the Devil with the word of
34:18
God choosing to believe in the word of God choosing to hold on to the word of
34:23
God choosing for the word of God to be your absolute truth and guide
34:31
Compass when you do that you win the devil's slay he's defeated
34:40
Hallelujah it says in 1 Peter 58 be alert and of sober
34:48
mind sober mind
34:53
means that you're using your mind right because when you're drunk like if a person's actually like drunk
35:00
with alcohol or on drugs they're like incapacitated like their mind can't
35:06
really function their mind is not like conscious and able
35:12
to work well right so to be sober of mind so we have to be alert be ready is
35:20
it going to be a battle today I don't know well if there is I'm ready because I I put that Bel of Truth on my around
35:27
my waist the armor of God and I grab that sword of the spirit so I'm ready if there's a battle today that's what it
35:34
means to be alert now and of sober mind so that
35:40
means you need to use your mind use the wisdom that's been released
35:45
to you you've grown you've received all this equipping of knowledge use
35:53
it you don't just be like how you used to be as a baby oh my emotions are this
35:59
way so I'm just going to follow my emotions be sober of Mind use your mind
36:06
use wisdom we moved on from that now we've received so much Revelation equipping
36:14
now we know what to do now we know not to believe those lies now be sober of
36:19
mind your enemy be alert and of sober mind your enemy the devil prows around
36:25
like a roaring lion looking for someone to
36:31
devour so this shows us that the more we are on guard the more we are being
36:40
mature being mature choosing to be mature the more the devil's going to look and see H I can't devour them I'm
36:47
not even going to try that's that's really true it's for real and I've seen
36:53
that in my life I've seen like such an amazing grace where um um the battles
36:59
are few and far between it comes as a reward for
37:09
consistently obeying God being mature being a good soldier in Christ and it
37:15
like automatically comes as like the devil's like oh this isn't an easy War I'll probably lose this one because this
37:22
one is mature I can't outsmart this one so I'm not going to
37:28
try but what he will do is he'll do like what he did with Jesus like Jesus he knew that he knew that was not going to
37:35
be an easy battle when he tempted Jesus in the wilderness but the devil still
37:42
wants to try he's well the thing is is like especially with um like there's Servants of God where
37:50
where the devil just can flat out no like I don't have a chance but because
37:56
he's evil he wants to cause pain so that's many times like the
38:02
devil's thought process of attacking like mature Servants of God
38:07
mature Believers of God is not so much like ooh I think I have a chance to devour them it's like I don't have a
38:15
chance but because he's he's evil he's like I just want to bring try to bring pain to
38:22
them try to bring sadness especially when you H if you have done something
38:27
powerful for god um if you have done something really powerful for God the
38:33
devil is extra angry and so he can sometimes attack right after you've done
38:39
something really powerfully for God for God's kingdom and it's not that the devil's like I must stop this person
38:47
it's like the devil knows he can't but it's like the devil's just so mad he just wants to cause some pain now you
38:53
don't have to let him cause pain though that's why I'm giving you this equippment you don't have to let him cause you pain that's why I'm giving
38:59
this equipping like for him to to try to to bring a little um he brings an attack
39:06
in your mind or just something happens that just kind of upsets you you you can
39:12
instead be you don't have to let it get you down you don't have because God to
39:19
to to strengthen us God can allow the enemy to do things like that
39:25
sometimes because with every battle we go through we're going to get stronger so it's not like you reach a certain
39:32
point and God's just so proud of you that he's like all right no more battles
39:37
for you no more refining fire for you no he wants you to shine brighter and
39:43
brighter for him and be transformed more and more so he'll allow battles like
39:48
that he'll allow like attacks of the enemy sometimes like that but if you can be equipped with these truths that I'm
39:54
sharing with you like this truth right now that when you do something powerful for God against the enemy the enemy is
40:03
going to be angry and there is a chance that he could try to attack in some way
40:09
just to try to steal your joy of what God just did you know so if you can be
40:15
equipped with this like be alert not not not that you're dreading like dreading it or something but like the next time
40:21
you do something powerful for God you're just like you're prepared like you know what I'm not going to let anything steal
40:27
my joy like what God just did and how he was for his glory able to use me as a
40:34
vessel you know this person was delivered for example and I got to just be filled with so much joy to see God
40:40
deliver this person like I'm not going to I'm I'm not going to let the devil see my joy if he tries to see my joy I'm
40:47
not going to let him I know that the devil's gon to be mad well too bad I'm not going to let him affect me
40:53
you know th this type of equipping this is what it means to be alert and of
40:59
sober mind be alert be ready be ready for when the enemy attacks sometimes
41:05
Luke 4:13 this is right after Jesus was tempted by the devil in the wilderness
41:11
it says when the devil had finished all this tempting he left him Jesus until an
41:18
opportune time he left Jesus until an opportune
41:26
time an opportune time so opportune time means can mean a
41:32
couple things number one it can mean at a weakness
41:38
point or it could mean also what I just shared where you know you're full of so much
41:44
joy and and the enemy is like ooh here's an opportune time to to try to hurt
41:51
them all right so Jesus is not facing this Battle of
41:57
the devil like all the time oh constantly it's a battle no it says the devil left him until an
42:05
opportune time so you need to recognize like
42:12
patterns of the devil like I've recognized certain patterns and patterns of Attack Of The Devil in my life like
42:20
um you know waiting for the promises of God and this for me this is
42:27
two parts because I was I was waiting for the promises of Revival to break out when our church when my church decreased
42:33
a number for years and I was in financially
42:39
um in a really hard place financially and so there's that that I I
42:45
was waiting for the promise back then so I went through it back then but also even now like I'm waiting for promises on God now and so I can tell you for
42:54
like eight plus years I've noticed pattern where like my default is full of
43:02
God's joy my default is contentment my default is just naturally feeling so
43:07
grateful and so blessed my default is you know that that's my default my default
43:15
is peace praise God but then like
43:20
sometimes maybe it's maybe like you know there's so much expectancy and hope for
43:26
the new year and it's like you you dream like this will be the year that I believe this
43:32
will be the year that this happens you know you really you really believe you're really expecting this is the Year
43:39
this is the year that the promise will come to pass so I've noticed like sometimes it will be like December
43:45
sometimes it will be like towards the end of the year and just all these thoughts can come that don't usually
43:50
come throughout the year of like didn't happen maybe it's going to be several years later then and you know
43:58
and this is too bad that it hasn't happened yet really want it to
44:03
happen um oh sometimes waiting is hard like all
44:09
those like thoughts can sometimes can just like come and I've noticed like
44:16
it's not often but those those times then there will be this feeling like I
44:21
was sharing before of like oh you you don't have a good heart you know you're not grateful
44:27
so many would long for what you have now and you're you're just so wanting the
44:33
promise and you're not you know having the feelings of contentment yada yada yada and um and then as I would be um as
44:44
I would persevere by keeping on doing what God is calling me to do rather than
44:50
have a pity party and like just be like I need to just take a break from
44:55
everything cuz I deserve it and this is hard no instead of doing that just keep doing the work keep being obedient and
45:03
choosing to not speak verbalize the feelings you know choosing to not
45:10
complain but instead choosing to praise God to thank God to confess his word his
45:18
truths and to choose to be humble by the word spoken like Lord you
45:25
know best and I know that the promise hasn't come to pass because your ways are higher like
45:32
you know why it hasn't come to pass yet and it's because this is your perfect timing and so if it came to pass when I
45:38
wanted it to then it would be out of your will and out of your time and I don't want that and so I just thank you Lord that you're in
45:45
control and I thank you that you're working behind the scenes and for your
45:51
will to be done and the promises to come to pass and so I'll say those things while not feeling it
45:58
but choosing to speak those things instead of speaking what I feel or just being quiet but choose to
46:05
speak those things so anyways as I do that time will pass maybe it'll be just
46:11
a day maybe it'll be a couple days and all of a sudden I feel I feel the
46:16
default way again the default content full of contentment full of joy full of
46:23
gratitude I feel that way right and I'll feel this default joy and and
46:32
this has happened numerous times where actually it's like God remind God shows me in that moment you know this is you
46:38
this is the real you the feelings you were having
46:43
yesterday that was an attack of the devil this was the devil coming for an opportune time this was the devil coming
46:51
you know because it's been a long time and it doesn't feel like forward motion or something you know towards the
46:58
promise there's you know he came at this time that he was hoping it would really
47:03
like bring you down or maybe want to give up or something so this was an
47:08
attack you know this wasn't I mean these thoughts came from the enemy it was an
47:13
opportune time attack from the devil you know um and
47:19
so that that's not you the feelings you had then it was coming from this strategic attack from the enemy and when
47:27
you go to battle with the devil Jesus was there with 40 days for the de with the devil battling so you know even if
47:35
you immediately reject the devil's lies it doesn't mean that you your feelings
47:41
will automatically like feel joyful it's not like you reject the devil's lies and
47:46
just poof um it's just gone sometimes the battle the devil can you know
47:53
continue to try to send thoughts for several days or something something you know and you just got to be strong and
48:00
keep persevering and keep going according to God's word instead of your
48:05
rather than your feelings so I'm sharing this with you because this is very important for you
48:11
to have in your belt of truth that you are in a spiritual war
48:17
that the more you are surrendered to God and serving God as I shared you're not going to find like every single day is
48:22
this like intense battle no like you'll find probably you know as you mature that most days you're full of joy
48:31
and peace and contentment I mean you're just your feelings feel that way but we
48:36
have this principle that the Devil comes at an opportune time he we are still in
48:42
the spiritual war and there will be these attacks once in a while and they're usually going to come in the
48:48
mind so I say that because it's like the Devil comes at this opportune time in a
48:55
vulnerable moment and your weakness and I want to encourage you I want to encourage you to have victory in your
49:01
weakness to have victory in your vulnerability to not like you know for months you know you're
49:09
only confessing words of life but then in this opportune moment attack from the devil vulnerable time you all of a
49:16
sudden just open these doors and speak words of death like you don't have to do that what you can do instead is choose
49:23
to mature is choose to take this Revelation I'm equipping you
49:29
with put it on your belt of Truth and put that belt of Truth on you
49:35
every day so you know if you've if if this sounds familiar for you like you've
49:41
struggled with this you struggled with when the enemy attacks you know or you know you you feel like you're Moody and
49:49
you feel like you're just so emotional and like you're not steadily you know being obedient to God
49:56
if like if you struggle with this then this what I'm sharing right now like maybe it's been 15 minutes I've been
50:02
talking this like take this moment I'll I'll
50:07
make it a short clip and I'll put on YouTube but you could even like download it screen record it like 15 minutes or
50:14
transcribe it like write it down and like listen to it again and again and
50:20
again and again because when you can get this in you when that opportune time
50:25
that the Devil Comes one month from now two months from now five months from now a year from now you won't forget you
50:33
will be equipped you have been aware for all that time you will be ready to have
50:39
victory over the devil amen and so like for the example I
50:44
just gave you know for this example I just gave every time you know God shown me that like it's
50:50
like be there's that temptation to believe the devil's lies of like God
50:55
isn't proud of you God's appointed in you like the way your feelings are right now um God's disappointed in you
51:03
and you know there's that temp those thoughts will come and what I really
51:09
want to encourage you with is to get out of that get out of that thinking ever
51:14
that God is condemning that God doesn't understand that God is is disappointed
51:21
the second you make a mistake he's so angry d d d you know
51:27
imagine this attack is happening up this attack is happening towards you
51:33
and actually Jesus is praying for you cheering you on actually God is fighting
51:40
this battle for you he's he's giving you more strength he's giving you more power to
51:48
overcome this attack so it's the opposite of what most people are thinking in these moments of
51:55
vulnerability in the opportune times that the Devil Comes these attacks of the devil it's the
52:02
opposite and so you know if that's you if your default is peace Joy contentment
52:08
and grateful to God and you know just contentment like on on my normal day I'm
52:15
like I really can't wait for the promises but I'm I'm okay that they're not here
52:23
now like it's okay I'm I'm I'm so blessed and God's timing is perfect like
52:28
that's my me on a default day right and so on most days so if on a day I'm not
52:34
feeling that way it's so important for me to remember this isn't me like God's
52:40
not just like oh you're not grateful enough it's an attack of the enemy it's
52:47
a strategic attack where in this place a vulnerability where you it's been
52:53
difficult you've been persevering for a long time and waiting for a long time and the devil's trying and so yeah
53:01
emotions can be not as bright because of the attack of the enemy just like Jesus
53:08
do you think he was it was like butterflies and Roses feelings when he was tempted for 40 days
53:15
in the wilderness and he was hadn't eaten for 40 days and the devil
53:21
is tempting him trying attacking him speaking to him do you think was feeling
53:27
butterflies and Roses oo this is fun oh I love life o
53:33
like No And so this is how it is in this spiritual war there's going to be days
53:39
that um we don't have those natural feelings but we're in the war you know so when
53:47
you when you find that I don't mean like overp spiritualize everything I don't mean that but just be aware that there's
53:54
going to be times where it's a spiritual attack when you start to sense that you don't feel yourself your emotions aren't
54:01
matching what they usually are and you know they're not right like you know that there's so much to be grateful for
54:06
and you don't know why you're feeling like down you know um that's an attack
54:12
and God's cheering you on he's not upset with you persevere reject the devil's
54:19
lies in those moments of attack make more intention to meditate on your
54:25
blessings make more intention to seek God in his word to receive equipping in
54:32
the teachings make more intention to thank God worship Him meditate on how
54:39
good he is and the blessings he's given you
54:45
amen hallelujah all right so I'm just going to read through like what I went through
54:52
today um the the basics that you need to be carrying on your when you carry these Basics on your belt of Truth every day
54:59
