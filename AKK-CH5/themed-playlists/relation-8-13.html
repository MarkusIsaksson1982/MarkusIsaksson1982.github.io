welcome to another episode of revival is
0:33
now on the last episode i taught about
0:35
the power of your words and that the way
0:38
to execute your authority is to use your
0:42
words the power of life and death is in
0:44
your tongue so as you speak life you are
0:47
bringing about god's will to be done and
0:48
you're executing your authority properly
0:51
you're closing all doors to the devil
0:53
and you're advancing god's kingdom but
0:55
if you're speaking words of death you're
0:57
opening up doors to the enemy and this
0:59
is where yokes can come in there can be
1:02
oppression
1:03
and you could even be partnering with
1:05
the enemy's kingdom rather than god's
1:07
kingdom there is so much power in your
1:09
words you're going to learn today even
1:11
more how you can be speaking exactly how
1:14
god wants so that you stay in god's will
1:17
as a child of god one of the big ways
1:19
that you're speaking is in prayer
1:22
is speaking to god it's very important
1:25
to learn how to pray the right way your
1:27
every word carries power whether it's in
1:30
prayer to god or whether it's speaking
1:32
to friends or just speaking aloud the
1:34
devil can hear your words he can't hear
1:37
your thoughts but he does hear your
1:38
words and he's not omnipresent like god
1:41
so it's not like he is listening to
1:42
every single person at the same time but
1:45
he does have a kingdom of darkness he
1:47
does send out demonic spirits
1:49
to listen and so we really need to make
1:51
sure that our every word is according to
1:54
god's will even when we're talking to
1:56
god even when you're in the secret place
1:59
with god many christians are not praying
2:01
with maturity or wisdom and so today
2:02
you're going to learn how to pray as a
2:04
mature believer of god there are
2:06
different aspects to prayer and the
2:08
first one is intimacy with god we see
2:10
adam and eve walking in the cool of the
2:12
garden experiencing intimacy with the
2:15
father and this is what god wants for
2:17
every single one of his children that
2:19
you would be in a real relationship and
2:21
have true
2:23
intimacy with god the holy spirit is
2:26
with you all the time he never leaves
2:29
you
2:30
and he wants you to be aware that he's
2:32
always with you he wants you to bring
2:34
him in your life
2:36
every day
2:38
all day
2:39
rejoice always pray without ceasing now
2:43
if you're thinking about this in the
2:45
religious way which is that prayer is
2:48
going into your room and speaking a
2:51
bunch of formal vocabulary prayers like
2:54
speaking through the language of the
2:56
king james version when that's not how
2:58
you speak today religious prayers mean
3:01
reciting the same prayer again and again
3:04
and again
3:05
where you're really just reciting
3:07
something rather than connecting to an
3:10
actual person the person of the holy
3:12
spirit god wants you to see him for who
3:15
he is just as real as you are he is a
3:18
person he has a heart he's not a stone
3:22
figure he's not far away only up in
3:25
heaven and can't understand you he
3:28
created you he knows you
3:30
he wants you to connect with him as you
3:34
connect with your best friends the
3:35
people you love on this earth the most
3:38
how do you do that you talk to your
3:40
friends
3:41
normal like your own personality your
3:44
own self you don't look at that person
3:46
as if they're judging you the
3:48
relationship you're having together you
3:50
don't look at the time and say we're
3:52
going to be really experiencing intimacy
3:54
once we hit one hour that we've been
3:56
talking back and forth your
3:58
relationships on earth with people you
3:59
really love are natural are enjoyable
4:03
our fun
4:04
are real and so that's how god wants it
4:07
to be for you all of those things i just
4:09
mentioned the religious way this is how
4:12
so much of us in the body of christ have
4:15
been kind of like taught how to pray or
4:16
we haven't been taught how to pray so
4:18
this is just what we think praying
4:20
should be like i know for me before my
4:23
eyes opened up in the spiritual realm
4:25
for most of my life i condemned myself
4:29
because i thought i didn't know how to
4:31
pray i ended up not praying a lot of the
4:33
time because i didn't know how to no one
4:35
ever broke it down to me simply as god
4:38
wants intimacy be real with him
4:41
he's in you always you don't have to be
4:44
formal and unnatural but i'm telling you
4:47
now be yourself with god renew your mind
4:50
that he knows you he's with you and he
4:52
loves you just invite him in and so pray
4:55
without ceasing if you're thinking about
4:57
it in the religious way can seem really
4:59
daunting but really pray without ceasing
5:02
isn't something too difficult it really
5:04
just means include god in your life
5:07
throughout your every day it doesn't
5:09
always have to be with words just like
5:10
how your relationships on earth you're
5:13
not talking all the time
5:15
sometimes you're just sitting and be
5:16
quiet or you look at the person and you
5:18
smile or you're just sitting and resting
5:21
in god's presence together the important
5:23
thing is that there's intimacy without
5:24
ceasing meaning sometimes you're talking
5:26
with god sometimes you're just saying
5:28
thank you sometimes it's as if he's in
5:30
the room like
5:31
you're excited about something and you
5:33
can just say oh i'm so excited about
5:34
this god i was doing errands yesterday
5:37
and i was having so much fun on like a
5:39
date with god like it was just him and
5:41
me and it wasn't mundane it wasn't
5:42
boring because i renewed my mind that he
5:45
was with me and i included him and
5:47
little things that would bless my heart
5:49
throughout the day that i was seeing
5:50
whether it was the nature or or i found
5:53
something in a store that i needed and i
5:55
was like oh yeah i found this i included
5:57
god in that as if he was my best friend
6:00
with me doing errands with me going on
6:02
planes if i see the sunset or something
6:04
or the clouds will say wow god it's so
6:06
beautiful thank you lord for this
6:08
beautiful sunset you just showed me
6:10
that's praying without ceasing so the
6:12
first part of your relationship is
6:14
intimacy is just simply being intimate
6:17
with god including him in your life as
6:20
your best friend the second part of
6:22
prayer is praise and thanksgiving
6:26
and it says it here right in the same
6:27
verse rejoice always
6:30
which is praising rejoice
6:32
pray without ceasing give thanks in all
6:35
circumstances for this is the will of
6:36
god in christ jesus for you so it says
6:40
rejoice always and give thanks in all
6:42
circumstances
6:44
pray without ceasing so be intimate
6:46
always with jesus rejoice always meaning
6:50
man remind yourself of god's blessings
6:52
that he's given you don't let a blessing
6:55
that comes by in your life each day pass
6:57
by without rejoicing without
6:59
acknowledging that god gave you that
7:01
most of my prayer time is praise and
7:03
thanksgiving because
7:05
the lord has opened up my eyes in the
7:07
spiritual realm to
7:09
see that i can trust him that i don't
7:12
have to worry
7:13
that god is faithful that my life is in
7:17
his hands
7:18
that my feelings are not the truth and
7:21
so therefore i can do what the scripture
7:24
says rejoice always instead of rejoice
7:27
sometimes and complain other times i can
7:29
give things in all circumstances not i
7:32
can give thanks in sometimes and in
7:34
other times when things aren't going my
7:36
way i can
7:37
pout and complain to god no because i
7:40
know god's plans for me are good because
7:42
i know i can trust them because he is
7:44
faithful because i know that there are
7:46
going to be weapons formed against me
7:48
but they will not prosper because i know
7:50
that the devil will attack me but he
7:53
will not succeed because i know that
7:55
there are wilderness seasons in life
7:57
there are refining fire seasons of life
7:59
and god's will isn't always
8:01
fun or comfortable but it's perfect
8:04
because of all of this i can give thanks
8:07
in all circumstances when things are
8:10
hard i can thank god thank you lord for
8:12
taking me through the fire i know this
8:14
is needed there was times when i was in
8:16
the wilderness before entering a
8:18
promised land of seeing god's promises
8:19
come to pass like this revival there
8:21
were times in the wilderness where it
8:23
was so hard where it was not fun where
8:27
there was persecution there were times
8:29
when the church was getting smaller and
8:31
smaller and smaller and more and more
8:33
people would leave and people that i
8:34
would love be part of our family at
8:37
fightful church would leave and it was
8:39
hard i remember one time just being in
8:42
the shower and crying and my emotions my
8:45
feelings were saying one thing inside
8:48
they were saying this is hard like
8:50
wanting to complain wanting to pout
8:53
wanting to just be upset and wallow but
8:56
i am not my feelings my soul does not
8:59
have to run the show of my life my
9:01
spirit is what was resurrected with
9:03
christ and is made one with the holy
9:05
spirit my soul and my body are being
9:07
transformed into the image of christ i'm
9:09
not letting my soul and my flesh control
9:11
me i'm making my soul my body be
9:14
submitted to this my spirit man which
9:17
follows the holy spirit as the leader
9:20
and so my spirit says god is faithful
9:23
this wilderness is necessary this
9:26
refining fire is molding me into the
9:28
person that god needs me to be to carry
9:31
the promises for my life what i'm going
9:33
through right now god is allowing it for
9:35
my good i've been praying for the
9:37
promises to come to pass this hard time
9:39
right now is the answer to those prayers
9:41
because i cannot get to the promised
9:43
land without going through the refining
9:45
fire so my spirit knew this truth my
9:47
spirit pushed the soul down my spirit
9:50
didn't allow my feelings to to come out
9:53
of my mouth but my spirit had been
9:56
meditating on god's word and his
9:58
goodness my spirit had grown so my
10:00
spirit could win and push the soul down
10:04
my spirit knows the power of my words my
10:06
spirit only wants to please god
10:08
and it says you can't please god without
10:10
faith it's the only time it talks about
10:11
pleasing god in the bible specifically
10:13
like that which means the thing that
10:15
pleases god the most most is faith so i
10:18
say
10:19
faith is what pleases god
10:21
all i want to do is please god in good
10:23
times and bad all i want to do is please
10:25
god and i don't want to do anything to
10:27
open up the door to the devil by
10:29
speaking words of death and slowing down
10:32
the road to the promised land or even
10:34
aborting it but in that moment there in
10:36
that shower through the tears i would
10:38
speak god i praise you i thank you lord
10:41
for doing what you're doing
10:43
for taking me through the refining fire
10:44
lord i know you know best
10:46
i know this is necessary i know your
10:49
control
10:50
i thank you lord that you're in control
10:51
not me because i don't know what i need
10:53
but you know what i need you know what
10:55
you need to take me through to refine me
10:57
i thank you lord tears
10:59
tears i thank you lord i praise you lord
11:02
thank you lord and then my feelings
11:04
inside are not feeling excited to praise
11:07
god but i praise him anyways i think to
11:09
many ways i chose to do those things and
11:12
it's time right now you learn the mature
11:14
way to pray many people think the way to
11:16
pray the way to have intimacy with god
11:19
is to just let all your feelings out
11:22
but that is because they do not know
11:24
that they were created to walk in
11:26
authority they did not know that you
11:28
execute your authority by speaking and
11:30
you if you speak words of death you're
11:32
handing your authority over to the devil
11:35
many christians do not know this
11:37
so they live not aware of their words
11:39
they live not knowing the devil's
11:41
hearing your words he's seeing your lack
11:44
of faith he's seen that you're giving in
11:46
to your feelings that you are listening
11:48
to your feelings over faith and then he
11:50
brings the attacks on more and more you
11:51
you wedge the door open
11:53
now he brings he knows exactly where to
11:55
hit you he knows exactly your weak spot
11:57
people without this spiritual maturity
12:00
with their eyes opened
12:01
they're saying just pray to god tell him
12:04
all your feelings there's something that
12:06
david does he he grows in wisdom and he
12:08
says in psalm 43 5 why my soul are you
12:11
downcast why so disturbed within me put
12:14
your hope in god for i will yet praise
12:17
him my savior and my god
12:20
this is what we can learn from david
12:22
right here
12:23
he spoke to his soul he noticed just as
12:26
my example when my soul my feelings were
12:29
downcast
12:31
his spirit was strengthened his spirit
12:34
was alive and his spirit could recognize
12:37
that his soul needed some work that his
12:39
soul needed to submit spirit soul body
12:42
needed to follow the holy spirit
12:45
and so he says why my soul are you
12:47
downcast why so disturbed within me put
12:51
your hope in god for i will yet praise
12:54
him my savior in in my god the bible
12:56
talks about how there's a time to grieve
12:59
there's a time to mourn
13:01
there's yes and we see jesus
13:04
wept when he saw lazarus had died we see
13:07
him with anguish in the garden yes
13:10
there's a time
13:12
to grieve to have sorrow
13:14
but there's a difference between
13:17
having the emotions of sorrow and
13:19
rejecting hope and having the feelings
13:23
of sorrow
13:24
but not letting the sorrow
13:27
rule over you sure there will be
13:29
discouragement there will be sorrow
13:31
there will be disappointment
13:33
there will be grief but all of those
13:36
things should not rule over us
13:38
and make us go into a place where we're
13:41
not thinking of the things of god the
13:43
things that are good which jesus says
13:45
put your minds on things that are good
13:47
always pure lovely admirable worthy of
13:49
praise in the times where we're feeling
13:53
loss
13:54
heartache sadness we should immediately
13:57
be speaking to our soul have hope god is
14:00
faithful i don't understand this but god
14:03
is faithful that's the difference than
14:05
being like i don't understand this god
14:08
why would you do this god why would you
14:10
take this from me god you've made me mad
14:13
you've made me sad god why would you do
14:15
this i'm so upset
14:17
i don't know how it can go on immature
14:20
believers think that's the way to be
14:21
intimate with god that's the way to be
14:23
real with god
14:24
but that is letting your feelings
14:28
dictate you and complaining to god when
14:31
we should always be people of faith even
14:33
in the darkest moments of life we should
14:35
always want to please god
14:38
by having faith
14:40
it says
14:41
rejoice always
14:43
not 99 of the time it says give thanks
14:46
in all circumstances so in order to do
14:49
these things you have to speak to your
14:52
soul and in those places where it's hard
14:56
you have to choose to only speak life
14:59
in your prayer time into your intimacy
15:01
time you have to choose to thank god to
15:04
praise him to declare his word to say
15:07
lord you are faithful your promises are
15:09
yes and amen i don't understand all
15:12
that's going on right now but you are
15:14
faithful i will praise you through
15:16
everything i will praise you through the
15:18
storms i will praise you in good times
15:20
and bad times i will never give up
15:23
i put my trust in my hope and my faith
15:26
in you not only is this pleasing to god
15:28
because faith is what pleases him but
15:30
remember there's power in your words
15:32
even in your time of prayer time the
15:34
devil's listening and if you are
15:37
speaking these words like i think i
15:39
should just give up and god i'm mad at
15:41
you it's actually opening up a door to
15:43
the enemy
15:44
to bring a stronghold of
15:47
doubt in god to bring a stronghold of
15:49
anger anger towards god and anger in
15:52
general in your life to bring a
15:54
stronghold of depression with my best
15:56
friends and my
15:58
my parents people i'm really close to i
16:00
talk to them differently than i used to
16:02
sometimes you can feel like oh you can
16:04
gossip about
16:05
just to your best friend about somebody
16:08
i used to complain to my best friends
16:10
and my people i'm close to i used to
16:12
speak my feelings
16:14
but now i don't do any of those things
16:17
now i can be real with my best friend
16:20
real with my people i'm close to and
16:22
tears in my eyes i can
16:24
you know i can get some sort of bad news
16:26
or something and be like wow i can't
16:28
believe this happened oh my goodness but
16:30
at the same time i don't allow myself to
16:34
to speak all the emotions that i feel
16:36
inside i don't allow myself to be like
16:39
i'm so upset i don't know if i'll make
16:41
it because this happened
16:43
i choose to speak faith god's in control
16:46
i trust god
16:48
i don't know what's gonna happen but all
16:50
i know is i trust god this situation
16:53
sure there's the feeling of wanting to
16:55
complain there's the feeling of wanting
16:56
to speak all your emotions especially to
16:58
your best friend
16:59
but i choose to be spiritually mature i
17:02
choose to be spiritually aware i'm in a
17:04
battle every day i'm not going to let
17:05
the devil any foothold in my life and
17:08
i'm focused on pleasing god every single
17:10
day every single day i want to please
17:12
him i don't want to forget about not
17:15
pleasing him always so that's how i'm
17:17
able to have care over my words
17:19
so in the same way now that i speak
17:21
differently with so much intention to
17:23
even the people who are close to me in
17:25
my life
17:26
this that's the same way for god
17:29
speaking with maturity to god
17:31
speaking in a way that's pleasing him
17:33
speaking full of faith jesus he shows us
17:36
this example father if you are willing
17:38
take this cup from me yet not my will
17:41
but yours be done jesus was sweating
17:43
blood he was filled with so much anguish
17:45
he knew what was about to happen to him
17:47
can you imagine being tortured being
17:49
scourged whipped
17:51
flesh dripping out of your body so much
17:53
blood being shed so much pain he knew
17:56
was about to come to him so close and
17:58
then being crucified on the cross he
18:02
knew clearly what was about to come that
18:04
anguish was so intense that he was
18:06
literally sweating drops of blood but
18:08
yet even in that moment he chose to
18:10
speak to his soul not my will even
18:13
though his will
18:14
he wanted so strongly he just wanted to
18:16
live he didn't want to go through that
18:17
torture he wanted that that was his will
18:20
so strongly he wanted that can you
18:22
imagine he was fully human of course all
18:24
of us at that moment that's the greatest
18:26
thing we want in the world is to not go
18:28
through that pain and
18:30
crucifixion but he speaks
18:33
my will father
18:35
your will be done this is what he
18:38
chooses to pray instead of i can't do it
18:40
i give up lord i can't go through with
18:43
this there has to be another way please
18:46
please please please
18:48
not my will but yours be done the next
18:51
part of prayer is seeking god's will
18:53
many times when we pray we're just we're
18:55
not even thinking about god's will but
18:56
we're just praying our will our desires
18:58
lord i want this to happen i want this
19:00
to happen i want this to happen we're
19:02
not even consulting god
19:04
but when you pray you should seek his
19:06
will lord
19:09
i feel as if i'm hearing you in this
19:10
area lord please confirm this is you
19:12
because i only want your will lord if if
19:15
my will is in this at all my feelings
19:17
and it's not your will lord please
19:19
reveal it to me close that door right
19:21
now even though i want this so bad but
19:23
if this is not your will please shut the
19:25
door lord i just want your will to be
19:28
done when you seek with that heart you
19:30
are allowing god
19:33
to
19:33
place you in his hands perfectly guide
19:36
you perfectly close every door that
19:38
needs to be closed and open every door
19:39
that he wants to open
19:41
and the last part of prayer that i'm
19:43
going to teach you about today
19:45
is praying god's will to be done
19:47
now most people when they pray they
19:49
they're praying ineffective prayers
19:51
they're praying
19:52
lord do this lord do this lord heal me
19:54
of this lord deliver me of this lord
19:55
heal this person lord deliver this
19:57
person lord bring money in my bank
20:00
account
20:01
lord i need this get me the job
20:04
they're saying god do this do this do
20:06
this do this do this but as i taught in
20:08
the last episode god's given you
20:10
authority he's given us authority as
20:12
children of god
20:13
and so god actually
20:15
needs us to partner with him and bring
20:18
his will to this earth so
20:20
it's god doing everything but he needs
20:24
us to walk in the authority
20:26
for his power to move through through us
20:28
as jesus says you heal the sick you cast
20:31
out demons you raise the dead you do it
20:34
you are the person doing this action but
20:36
it's my power giving you the ability and
20:38
doing the miracles but you need to be
20:40
the ones to be healed demons go that's
20:43
how it works you can't say uh make the
20:45
demons go lord they won't go
20:47
because you have the authority you have
20:48
to execute it so in the same way this is
20:51
how you should pray in every area of
20:52
your life
20:54
instead of saying god do this god do
20:55
this god do this you should be saying i
20:58
declare sickness and this body must go
21:01
by his stripes i am healed i must be
21:03
healed i declare off lots of anxiety all
21:05
thoughts of depression all these lies
21:07
from the devil in my head they must go i
21:09
have perfect peace in jesus christ i
21:11
thank you jesus for giving me perfect
21:13
peace thank him through this
21:15
declaring and make yourself aware that
21:18
yes you're the one declaring walking in
21:20
the authority but it's
21:21
god's power in you that's making
21:23
everything to happen when there's lack
21:26
in your life you can speak i declare
21:28
doors to open up so that there may be
21:30
provision and everything that's making
21:32
like there be a drain of my finances i
21:35
declare all those attacks to end now so
21:37
instead of asking god for things you
21:39
should constantly be walking in that
21:41
authority make sure that it's god's will
21:44
seek him in as well but we do know that
21:46
abundant life is absolutely god's will
21:48
that sickness
21:49
lacking in the area
21:51
depression anxiety that's not god's will
21:54
so when you recognize those things in
21:55
your life you can know already what
21:58
god's will is and that you can execute
22:00
that authority and you will see god
22:03
move as you pray now with your spiritual
22:06
eyes open you'll see god's will being
22:08
done and your prayers become effective
22:11
you'll experience intimacy with the holy
22:13
spirit like never before i declare your
22:16
faith to grow mightily i declare your
22:18
spiritual eyes up to open up more and
22:21
more and for you to be so discerning and
22:23
for you to walk in wisdom walk
22:25
constantly in awareness of what you're
22:27
speaking i declare you to have intimacy
22:30
with the holy spirit like never before
22:33
in jesus name may your spiritual eyes be
22:35
opened up now to recognize god to be
22:38
aware of him throughout your days in
22:40
jesus name i declare your words to carry
22:43
power i release this anointing upon your
22:45
words so that as you speak with
22:48
authority god's will will be done in
22:50
jesus name i declare your spirit man to
22:52
be strengthened and your soul and flesh
22:55

22:57

22:59
