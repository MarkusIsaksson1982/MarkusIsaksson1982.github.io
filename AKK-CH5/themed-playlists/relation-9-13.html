how to pray the Jesus way a couple of
0:04
Sundays ago I shared a message how to
0:07
have intimacy with God how to be a
0:09
friend of God and I'm going to be going
0:12
deeper into really how to pray how to
0:17
pray the right way a way that is
0:19
pleasing to God a way that is not
0:22
religious the Jesus way
0:26
amen it says in Matthew 9:14 one day the
0:30
Disciples of John the Baptist came to
0:31
Jesus and asked him why don't your
0:33
disciples fast like we do and the
0:35
Pharisees do Jesus replied do wedding
0:38
guests mourn while celebrating with the
0:39
groom of course not I'm going to fast
0:42
forward to the um I'm going to fast
0:45
forward uh to verse
0:50
17 who would patch old clothing with new
0:53
cloth for the new patch would shrink and
0:55
rip away from the old cloth leaving an
0:57
even bigger tear than before and no one
1:00
puts new wine into old wine skins for
1:02
the old skins would burst from the
1:03
pressure spilling the wine and ruining
1:06
the Skins new wine is stored in new wine
1:08
skins so that both are
1:11
preserved now the reason that Jesus
1:14
talks about um old wine versus new wine
1:18
right
1:20
after I mean I mean as a response to to
1:26
uh to the Disciples of John the Baptist
1:30
asking this question why don't your
1:31
disciples fast like we do and the
1:32
Pharisees do the reason being was
1:35
because Jesus was answering them you are
1:39
fasting and
1:41
praying you were because they go
1:44
together you are fasting and praying in
1:47
the old wine
1:49
way in a religious
1:53
ritualistic
1:54
traditional
1:57
way and I Jesus is saying I'm coming I
2:01
have come to bring new wine I have come
2:04
to destroy
2:07
religion and to show you my
2:12
way the way that leads to true
2:15
life so he's saying now I am teaching my
2:21
disciples how to pray and fast in the
2:24
new wine way non-religious non
2:28
ritualistic new wine wine way this new
2:31
wine way has
2:35
power it is not dead like religion it
2:39
has power and the new wine way is the
2:43
holy spirit Le
2:46
way because when we when I talk about
2:49
religion I'm talking about when you see
2:52
the Pharisees the Pharisees were
2:54
interpreting the word of God one way and
2:58
so they were if it was the same word of
3:01
God that they were reading that Jesus
3:03
was teaching
3:05
from teaching his disciples it's the
3:08
same word of God right but the Pharisees
3:13
had and and John the Baptist didn't have
3:16
the right
3:18
Revelation they didn't have the Jesus
3:20
Revelation Jesus hadn't come yet they
3:23
had old wine
3:25
Revelation religious
3:28
Revelation so
3:31
them them following the word of God was
3:34
done in this way of
3:37
rituals as a way to earn acceptance from
3:43
God like I'm doing this to to check the
3:49
boxes off of on this list here so that I
3:53
can perform a certain way that reaches
3:57
the bar
3:59
so now I'm righteous so now I'm
4:02
acceptable by
4:05
God that's what religion
4:08
is it's not
4:11
personal it's about rituals it's about
4:15
performance it's about checking things
4:17
off of the
4:20
list this is what Jesus was bringing
4:22
them out
4:24
of Jesus was bringing them into the new
4:27
wine which is led by the Holy Spirit
4:31
not based on tradition and
4:35
rituals but in relationship with God
4:42
Amen
4:44
so
4:45
religion has become so prevalent again
4:49
in the body of
4:51
Christ Jesus helped the people of God
4:55
get away from
4:57
religion those that would accept him the
4:59
IES wouldn't accept him and they stayed
5:01
in religion but those who accepted him
5:04
he helped them get out of religion But
5:07
as time has gone on the enemy has tried
5:10
to really bring back religion in the
5:14
church blinding people with
5:17
religion you know some of these
5:19
testimonies that we heard today we heard
5:20
many people be delivered of religion
5:23
they were describing it as like they
5:25
they were doing things in their own
5:27
effort they were just trying to do the
5:30
right things and not not ever measuring
5:34
up you know not ever feeling like they
5:38
were a good enough
5:40
Christian that's the heaviness of
5:44
religion um the reality is that God is
5:49
full of
5:51
love he is full of understanding he is
5:54
full of compassion he is full of
5:57
mercy and he's a real
6:00
person he is not a
6:03
statue and he's not like an
6:06
alien We Like We Are Made In His
6:10
Image he's relatable if that makes
6:13
sense so um like if you are a parent and
6:19
you have a child a young child you're
6:22
not lording over them this list of
6:25
things they must do and if they do this
6:28
and this and this and this then you say
6:31
you're okay I'll give you a smile now a
6:35
on the
6:36
back
6:39
right no you are that that's how
6:42
religion is but rather the parent is
6:45
after the heart the parent the parent
6:48
knows the CH the child won't be perfect
6:51
they're not expecting them to be
6:52
perfect but they want the they want
6:55
there to be character built in this
6:57
child they want the child to do their
7:01
best they they want the child just to
7:04
have a good
7:05
heart right but if they mess up they're
7:08
like of course you mess up you're a kid
7:11
there's no kid in the history of the
7:14
earth that's been like perfect that's
7:15
like acted like an adult when they're a
7:17
child you know what I mean so there's
7:21
the the full of grace a parent has for
7:23
their child and this parent wants the
7:27
best for their child the parent sees the
7:31
best in their child and the parent loves
7:34
their child more than they love
7:35
themselves they love them more than
7:36
anything in the world
7:38
right so that's how God is towards you
7:43
but a jillion times
7:45
more there's not even a number because
7:48
we can't comprehend Millions times
7:50
trillions times billions times
7:53
more so you see the
7:56
difference God is Not judging you
8:01
judging how you have a relationship with
8:05
him judging how you pray judging if
8:09
you've checked every box on the list
8:13
off he's after your heart looking at
8:17
your
8:18
heart and he's cheering you on and he's
8:21
wanting the best for
8:24
you before you learn how to pray the
8:27
right way you need to be seen God
8:29
rightly
8:31
seeing how God sees
8:33
you so whenever you think of God you
8:36
need to be thinking of him of his
8:38
amazing love and compassion for
8:40
you of of how he wants the best for you
8:43
of how he sees the best in you you
8:46
that's that's the the the core of being
8:49
able to pray in a way that's pleasing to
8:52
God is to see him
8:55
rightly he's a person not a
8:58
statue he's a
9:01
person
9:02
amen and so so many people they they um
9:07
they think that if they
9:12
pray religious sounding prayers Rel
9:15
spiritual sounding prayers lofty using
9:18
lofty words they wouldn't normally use
9:21
and pray for several
9:23
hours um they think that that is what is
9:28
touching God's heart
9:31
but that that is actually so much
9:34
performance do you
9:37
see in the relationship you have with
9:39
people on this Earth that you love the
9:41
most you are not out to impress them
9:44
with the
9:45
with with an with an impressive
9:47
vocabulary are you are you you know your
9:51
best friend or your spouse are you are
9:55
you spending hours studying a glossery
10:00
to impress them with how you speak to
10:03
them the words you use the
10:05
vocabulary are you setting a timer I
10:09
must speak two hours to them and then
10:13
they'll love
10:17
me but you know God is a real
10:21
person and the less we treat him as a
10:23
real person the less the more we treat
10:25
him as a robot or
10:27
something not a person
10:29
sin the more we're not going to love him
10:33
the more we're not going to want to
10:35
spend time with him the more difficult
10:38
it will be to spend time with him the
10:40
more you'll be listening to the enemy's
10:42
lies of
10:44
condemnation lies that God is upset with
10:47
you disappointed with you you'll never
10:49
be a good enough
10:51
Christian right so this is so important
10:54
that we are seeing God rightly we're
10:57
seeing him as a real person
11:03
Matthew 18:3 says and he said truly I
11:06
tell you unless you change and become
11:08
like little children you will never
11:11
enter the kingdom of
11:16
heaven now becoming like little children
11:18
Jesus is saying Jesus is Jesus is saying
11:21
this to you unless you become like
11:23
little children you will not enter the
11:25
Kingdom of
11:27
Heaven you will not receive
11:30
the the the Abundant Life that
11:34
comes with entering in the Kingdom of
11:36
Heaven you will not receive the healing
11:39
the Deliverance the Miracles The Joy the
11:41
peace the experiencing the intimacy that
11:45
comes with entering in the Kingdom of
11:48
Heaven unless you become like little
11:50
children now this means being
11:53
teachable being humble
11:59
this is the big meaning of becoming like
12:01
little
12:03
children but that's not all he's also
12:05
speaking about your relationship with
12:12
him some of you are struggling so you
12:16
you you're struggling so much to have a
12:18
relationship with God you're struggling
12:19
in prayer you're struggling feeling like
12:23
I don't know how to have a relationship
12:24
with God I don't know how to pray I feel
12:27
like I'm doing it wrong I I feel like
12:30
I'm not saying enough words I feel like
12:32
I'm not praying long
12:35
enough but God says that children are
12:39
the ones that enter the kingdom of
12:45
heaven so that shows us that to
12:50
pray even a child can
12:54
do to
12:56
pray and to have relationship with God
13:00
is so
13:03
simple that a child can do
13:07
it and this scripture actually teaches
13:10
us so much about
13:13
prayer that it's not supposed to be so
13:19
complicated that we're not supposed to
13:22
go in prayer to God seeing him as this
13:26
um
13:29
professor at Harvard of English or
13:36
something or the president of the United
13:39
States or something like we we don't
13:42
have to feel so out of
13:44
place and so
13:48
inadequate a child can be friends with
13:50
God a child can pray it's a God and when
13:55
a child prays god loves the prayer
14:03
amen
14:09
hallelujah you need to stop judging your
14:12
prayers to God you need to stop judging
14:15
your relationship with God you need to
14:17
stop listening to those lies of the
14:19
devil because I'm telling you prayer is
14:22
really so simple you can do it in a way
14:25
that pleases
14:27
God hallelujah
14:30
praise
14:34
God 1 Corinthians 14:15 says so what
14:38
shall I do I will pray with my spirit
14:41
but I will also pray with my
14:45
understanding I will also pray with
14:48
my
14:51
understanding I will pray with
14:54
my
14:57
understanding the prayer that God is
15:00
looking for is praying with
15:05
understanding if you're praying
15:07
religiously like the Pharisees did
15:10
you're not praying with the
15:11
understanding of who Jesus
15:14
is you're not praying with the
15:17
understanding that it's not rituals and
15:19
fancy prayers and really long prayer
15:23
sessions that are just full of empty
15:27
words that pleases
15:32
God praying with understanding means
15:34
that God is looking for Faith like a
15:38
child a relationship with him that a
15:41
child can
15:44
have praying with understanding means
15:47
understanding of who God
15:50
is so that when you pray with him you
15:52
know who you're talking to the most
15:55
loving person in the whole
15:57
world who loves you more than anybody in
15:59
this world who wants the best for you
16:03
who loves spending time with you who is
16:07
never judging you or condemning
16:09
you praying with that
16:13
understanding the understanding of of of
16:16
of God's
16:17
heart the understanding as I shared a
16:19
couple weeks ago the understanding that
16:23
God's whole heart is his
16:26
people is for his kingdom to advance
16:29
is for his people to know him is for his
16:32
people to be healed to be delivered for
16:34
the works of the devil to be destroyed
16:36
in people's lives that's God's biggest
16:39
passion so to know who you're talking
16:42
to to know what his heart is and to
16:46
speak to him
16:47
accordingly and to walk with him
16:49
accordingly in your daily life which
16:52
means in your obedience serving him
16:55
you're partnering with him that's
16:57
intimacy that's relationship
16:59
sh so so many times people think
17:02
relationship with God is about these
17:04
like long prayer sessions lofty
17:08
prayers that are empty words that are
17:11
just based on ritual and
17:15
performance when meanwhile God isn't
17:18
there God's not in the
17:20
religion God's in his kingdom
17:24
business and God's asking you to obey
17:26
him God's asking you to serve him God's
17:28
asking you to work with him partner with
17:30
him God's asking you to be a vessel of
17:32
him God's asking you to align with his
17:34
heart his heart of passion Fierce
17:38
passion for his
17:41
people pray with
17:44
understanding so when you're praying in
17:46
the religious way you're not praying
17:49
with
17:51
understanding that's not intimacy you're
17:54
missing
17:56
God it's not touching God's heart
18:01
you prayed for several hours these empty
18:03
words but meanwhile what have you done
18:06
to touch his heart what have you done
18:07
for his
18:09
kingdom what have you done in
18:11
partnership with
18:13
him
18:18
amen Hebrews 11:6 says and without faith
18:21
it is impossible to please God because
18:23
anyone who comes to him must believe
18:25
that he exists and that he rewards those
18:28
who earnestly seek him without faith it
18:31
is impossible to please
18:35
God so that also means that the way to
18:40
please
18:41
God is to have faith if you want to
18:46
please God you have to have
18:50
faith so praying with understanding a
18:54
big meaning of that is is to pray with
18:58
faith
19:02
and so many times people think that the
19:05
more you pray the more you repeat the
19:08
same thing over and over
19:10
again the more God will hear your prayer
19:14
the more likely he'll
19:16
move but it's really the opposite of
19:20
that because God's not dumb hilarious
19:24
obviously
19:25
not he's the smartest person in the
19:28
world
19:30
it sounds ridiculous to say
19:32
it but but
19:34
really do you repeat something a million
19:37
times to your friends to your
19:42
spouse if you did they would say do you
19:44
think I'm dumb I heard you do you think
19:47
I'm not listening so that's why I say
19:49
God's not
19:51
dumb God's not
19:54
deatha God hears you
20:01
and so it's it's really not spiritual
20:05
it's really not praying with
20:07
understanding of of of how powerful God
20:10
is to repeat things over and over
20:15
again to to think okay I'm not seeing
20:20
this thing happen in my life yet that
20:23
must mean I need to spend more hours in
20:25
prayer repeating the same thing over and
20:27
over again or that must mean I need to
20:30
pray or I need to fast for days
20:36
now that's not spiritual
20:39
because it's not
20:41
rituals that move the hand of God the
20:45
heart of God it's
20:49
Faith it's faith
20:52
and and going according to God's
20:56
ways like it's the anointing that
20:58
destroys the
21:00
Yoke so so many people are you know
21:04
they're seeing this revival they're seen
21:06
God move in power but they don't want to
21:09
let go of religion I've heard people
21:13
many times say you don't need to go to
21:14
that Revival
21:15
event you don't need a person to pray
21:18
for you you can just receive the miracle
21:21
right where you're
21:22
at that's
21:24
religion that's living without
21:26
understanding of God and his
21:29
ways because the it's the anointing that
21:31
destroys the Yoke the Bible says and
21:33
God's ways of releasing his anointing is
21:36
through vessels through his
21:39
servants and so to pray with
21:44
understanding when it comes to praying
21:47
for miracles to happen and seeing the
21:49
miracles happen in your life it means to
21:53
to request give God your
21:57
request and then locate where he is
22:01
moving in power where you
22:03
access what you have requested
22:09
for and then you actually move you go
22:12
you position yourself where the power of
22:15
God's moving and that's how you receive
22:18
the
22:20
miracle so there's people that want to
22:22
hang on to
22:24
religion and they're missing out on
22:26
their miracles
22:29
they're they're praying and praying and
22:32
praying and praying and fasting and
22:34
fasting and fasting and fasting and
22:36
trying to do many things in effort and
22:38
performance and they're not seeing any
22:40
Miracles take place in their
22:43
life they're not praying with
22:46
understanding they are praying and
22:48
fasting in the old wine way like the
22:50
Pharisees and like the Pharisees they
22:52
are missing out on touching God's heart
22:56
on entering the kingdom of heaven on
22:58
receiving miracles from
23:03
Jesus so the proper way to pray with
23:06
understanding is to make your request to
23:11
God and believe that he is heard
23:15
you and
23:18
believe that he has the power to release
23:21
this miracle to you and believe that he
23:24
is so good and so loving that he for
23:27
sure wants to to bless you with this
23:29
it's just about his
23:33
timing to believe his word that speaks
23:37
about how you have an inheritance from
23:40
God a co-inheritance with
23:45
Jesus a belief in the word of God that
23:48
by his stripes you are
23:53
healed Bel in the word of God that the
23:56
devil has come to steal kill and destroy
23:58
John 1010 but I have come that you would
24:00
have Abundant
24:04
Life so you
24:06
rest you rest and you you go find where
24:12
to access what you have requested for
24:15
requested
24:16
for f go where his anointing is go where
24:19
his power is and receive what you have
24:22
prayed
24:25
for that's how you pray with
24:27
understanding and receive what you've
24:30
prayed
24:32
for
24:34
Hallelujah those are the kinds of
24:36
prayers that touch God's
24:41
heart you know you're you you're you're
24:44
you're you're resting in
24:46
him you're believing in him you're
24:49
believing in his love for you and his
24:52
power and his ways you believe in his
24:56
anointing you believe even his
25:01
word that's how your prayer life should
25:04
be it's very simple isn't
25:07
it it's very
25:09
simple even a child can do
25:14
that
25:16
hallelujah praise
25:21
God James 4:2
25:24
says you want what you have don't have
25:27
so you scheme and kill to get it you are
25:29
jealous of what others have but you
25:30
can't get it so you fight and wage war
25:32
to take it away from them yet you don't
25:34
have what you want because you don't ask
25:36
God for it I'm going to read this part
25:38
again yet you don't
25:40
have what you want because you don't ask
25:43
God for it and even when you ask you
25:46
don't get it because your motives are
25:48
all wrong you want only what will give
25:51
you
25:54
pleasure now the scripture says yet you
25:56
don't have what you want because you
25:58
don't ask God for
26:01
it and so the
26:03
religious Revelation the wrong
26:05
revelation of this is God can never do
26:08
anything until I ask for it or I need to
26:13
keep asking and keep asking and keep
26:16
asking but the real newwind revelation
26:18
of this is you have not because you have
26:21
not asked with
26:26
understanding the current of Heaven is
26:29
Faith the currency to receive from God
26:31
is
26:33
Faith you know like the Pharisees are
26:35
doing they're doing so many commands
26:37
that are in the Bible but they're not
26:39
receiving they're not receiving the the
26:42
Miracles the healing the freedom the
26:44
things from
26:46
God because they're not praying with
26:48
understand understanding because they're
26:50
not praying with the right kind of
26:53
Faith but in
26:56
religion so
26:59
you know you can you can it's it's like
27:01
the example I just gave there are people
27:03
who are praying day and night for many
27:06
hours they're praying for certain
27:08
Miracles they're praying for miracles
27:10
for their family they're praying for
27:12
things to happen and they're fasting for
27:16
weeks and they're going to all night
27:19
prayer rooms and everything but they're
27:22
not getting
27:23
anything because they are not asking
27:27
with
27:28
understanding they are not praying the
27:31
right way they are not praying with
27:35
faith they are not praying the Jesus
27:39
way they are not doing what is necessary
27:43
to receive your prayer requests that
27:45
you've
27:48
asked
27:52
amen God is not impressed with your
27:56
rituals
27:58
he's impressed by your obedience and
28:01
your
28:03
faith I repeat God is not impressed with
28:06
your
28:07
rituals he's impressed by your obedience
28:11
and your
28:15
faith
28:19
Hallelujah so keep that in your
28:22
heart and that will be your compass of
28:25
how to
28:26
pray the Jesus
28:30
way this is just a taste of this
28:34
teaching that the Lord is leading me
28:36
leading me to share with you about how
28:37
to
28:38
pray I'm going to continue with this
28:41
next
28:42
Sunday I'm going to be teaching you why
28:45
prayers aren't effective and how to have
28:48
effective prayers that touch God's heart
28:50

28:51
more
28:53
amen
28:56
hallelujah so
28:58

29:01

29:04
word praise God praise God
29:08
hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you
29:11
