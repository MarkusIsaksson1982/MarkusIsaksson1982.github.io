0:00
today you shall know your true identity
0:06
Hallelujah it says in second Corinthians 5 16. so from now on WE regard no one
0:11
from a worldly point of view though we once regarded Christ in this way we do so no longer therefore if anyone is in
0:17
Christ the new creation has come the old has gone
0:22
the new is here Galatians 2 20 says I have been
0:27
crucified with Christ and I no longer live but Christ lives in me
0:32
the life I now live in the body I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me
0:39
I do not set aside the grace of God for if righteousness could be gained through the law Christ died for nothing
0:46
so Jesus by his grace has
0:52
removed all of your sins by what he did on the cross
0:57
by this great sacrifice he made he's removed all your sins when you give your
1:02
life to him what happens in the spiritual realm is your old self your life as a sinner where you were a sinner
1:11
your life where you were evil where you didn't have a good heart
1:17
that is dead it dies it is crucified with Christ when Jesus went into the
1:24
ground into the grave when you give your life to Jesus you have gone in there with Jesus in the grave
1:31
the old you is completely gone the old you how you identified yourself it is
1:39
gone your sinful nature your tendency to sin your tendency to think evil things
1:46
and want to do evil things it's dead it's gone and as Jesus rose from the grave you
1:54
have risen with him as a new creation it says the old has gone the new has come
2:02
you have become new a new creation when you give your life to Jesus with a new
2:08
identity your old identity is 100 gone 100 gone you have a new identity and
2:16
today you shall know your identity because many of you have never even learned what actually your identity in
2:22
Christ is many of you have taken part of your old identity with you but it's all gone
2:29
you need to know what your new identity is and you need to allow God to transform you into how he wants you to
2:36
be completely to be identified as amen
2:41
thank you Lord so number one you your identity is that
2:48
you are new you are a new creation and the past is gone completely the past you
2:54
is gone number two it says in John 1 11
3:00
but to all who had who did receive him who believed in his name he gave the right to become children of God who were
3:06
born out of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God
3:12
number two you are a child of God
3:17
that's your true identity your true identity is not your child of John and Susie whoever your parents are your true
3:25
identity is you are a child of God so that means that you are that you have a
3:32
father no matter if you have a physical father or not because your true identity is you
3:37
are a child of God if you were born without if you were if
3:44
you were adopted if you if your parents on Earth rejected you it doesn't make you less of a less belonging to to
3:52
someone less of a child because your true identity is that you
3:57
are a child of God that's your true identity the the Earthly parents that's an
4:04
Earthly Earthly thing but your Eternal identity your most true
4:10
identity is that you are a child of God
4:16
he's your true father he's not a stranger he's not someone that you need to feel
4:22
um afraid of he's your father you're his child and he loves you so
4:30
much the way a parent loves their child but a billion gazillion not even a number for
4:37
it more that we can't even comprehend that's how much he loves you he loves
4:42
you as if you are his only child in the whole world that's how big his love is
4:47
for you that's how much you belong truly belong to him
4:53
amen and it says and it says Romans 8 17 and
5:01
since we are his true children we qualify to share all his treasures for indeed we are Heirs of God himself and
5:07
since we are joined to Christ we also inherit all that he is and all that he has so as a child you need to know what
5:15
that identity is I mean as a child that means you have an inheritance you have an inheritance from God
5:22
all that Jesus has you have wow that's a lot you have all of Heaven's resources
5:28
you have healing Freedom Abundant Life in every area
5:34
abundance of Peace Abundance of Joy this is your inheritance as a child of God
5:40
you are rich you are wealthy you're the most wealthiest and the person in the
5:45
entire world we are we are the most wealthy the true riches
5:51
and we should walk like that I'm a Child of God I have an inheritance from God I
5:56
have all of Heaven Heaven's resources I have Abundant Life there's nothing I could want for there's
6:04
nothing I lack I have everything because I know who I am I'm a Child of
6:09
God you know how people on Earth act when they are children of like very wealthy people or very important people
6:15
you know how they act they have a swag right we gotta have a swag about us right
6:22
we know who we are we know what we have we're not poor beggars
6:29
they're children of God there's no greater inheritance than anyone can have on this Earth
6:35
than what we have Hallelujah all right we are new we are children of
6:41
God and number three we are pure we are the righteousness of God
6:49
it says in second Corinthians 5 21 God made him who had no sin to be sin for us
6:55
so that in him we might become the righteousness of God righteousness of
7:00
God the definitions if you look it up I mean right righteousness means pure purity of heart the quality a state of
7:07
being morally correct and justifiable upright
7:13
God because he's made us new and because he's washed all of our sins away and our
7:18
old sinful self is gone completely because of that this is how he can call
7:24
us righteousness of God this is how he can call us pure because we are new We Are Made In His
7:31
Image the real us that he sees in the spiritual realm is the righteousness of
7:36
God is pure the Bible says that we are no longer slaves to sin
7:42
it says Romans 6 6 for we know that we are old self was crucified with him so
7:47
that the body ruled by sin might be done away with that we would no longer be slaves to sin so it's not right to say
7:56
we're Sinners we're all sinners we're not that anymore that's not our
8:02
identity when we say we're Sinners that's saying that that's your identity that's saying that's literally saying that you're living your life continually
8:08
sinning we have Holy Spirit in us and he is
8:13
transforming us into His Image this is the meaning of we are no longer slaves to sin we were
8:20
Sinners before because we were slaves to sin it was controlling us we were in bondage before we had demons controlling
8:27
us before but now through the inheritance of Christ that he provides in this newness that he's made us we are
8:34
no longer slaves to sin no longer slaves we are no longer Sinners that's not our identity anymore
8:40
so this is how he really sees us as righteousness pure no longer a slave you
8:47
have to see yourself this way or you'll continue to live in your past identity living a lie
8:54
and not be able to transform into how who God wants you to be it says in second Corinthians 3 18 this is the
9:00
passion translation we can all draw close to him with the veil removed from our faces and with no Veil we all become
9:05
like mirrors who brightly reflect the glory of the Lord Jesus we are being
9:11
transfigured into his very image into his very image as we move from one
9:18
brighter level of Glory to another glory to glory and this glorious
9:24
Transfiguration comes from the Lord who is the spirit
9:30
so we are a new creation yes we need work we don't become looking exactly
9:35
like Jesus from day one but our spirit is pure our soul needs work but our spirit is
9:41
pure and that's the real you is your spirit not your soul not your flesh your spirit
9:48
so that's why God looks at you and says you're pure you're the righteousness of God this is who you really are you need
9:53
to see yourself that way you need to not see yourself as this as the parts of you that need work the soul
9:59
you need to see yourself I'm the righteousness of God I'm pure and this is I want what my spirit is to be all of
10:05
me I want to be transformed completely into the image of God not just my spirit would look like him but my soul my
10:12
feelings my mind my will would be would look would sound like Jesus
10:18
and it would translate to my body my actions everything would follow this is what but you have but but you
10:25
can't get there by being like Oh I'm a sinner I keep messing up
10:31
you have to know who you are I'm God sees me as pure he sees me as the righteousness of God lord I I want so
10:38
badly to be completely like you Lord help me and as you look to him because you're seeing him rightly that he's not
10:43
condemning you but he's seeing you with love he's seen you as pure righteousness he
10:49
loves you as you see him in that way that's how you're able to be transformed it says when we're looking at him but as
10:55
we look to him as we look to him not turn away from him because we're condemning ourselves because we're thinking he's condemning us but we're
11:01
looking to him that's how we are transformed so we we have to live in
11:07
this truth to be able to be transformed to be able to look at him to be transformed so our
11:13
soul is transformed so our body is transformed amen Hallelujah
11:19
Hallelujah so no longer getting down on yourself for the work that still needs to be done no longer calling yourself a
11:26
mess up a loser a sinner
11:32
but but seeing yourself how God sees you pure righteousness and I am being
11:37
transformed you have the Holy Spirit to help you and
11:42
he is enough he is enough don't try to when you look at your own strength you can't do it but
11:49
you have him to help you so have that faith I'm being transformed
11:55
into God's images absolutely I am because the Lord is helping me it's all
12:00
God doing it with my obedience amen okay next we have part of your
12:06
identity is that we are royal we are royalty you are royalty
12:13
it says in First Peter 2 9 you are a chosen people a royal priesthood
12:20
a holy nation God's special possession that you may declare the Praises of him who called you out of Darkness into his
12:27
wonderful light you are a chosen people a royal priesthood
12:33
we don't even need the scripture to know we are royal actually because guess who our father is
12:39
the king the king of kings the King of Kings is your father so what
12:46
does that make you royalty princess princesses Queens
12:52
Kings but the key the King of Kings but you you are the child of the king you are
12:58
royalty real royalty more real Royals a higher high much
13:05
higher royalty than the queens and kings in this world there are true Kings in this world like
13:11
in England there's a king you are more royalty than that way more in the
13:17
spiritual realm which is more real than the physical amen once again when royalty royalty on Earth
13:24
they know who they are they walk with a Swagger right oh walk like royalty
13:30
you gotta know who we are I don't mean just physically walk but that it just translate to that
13:36
because when what you think as a man or woman thinks so they are so you think um
13:42
I'm nothing I'm not worth anything and you start to
13:48
walk like this so it does even translate physical you need to start thinking who you are I'm royalty
13:55
I really am royalty my father's the king of kings and I'm
14:01
his daughter I'm royalty you can walk with our head up high
14:07
shoulders back with confidence knowing how worthy we are knowing how
14:15
chosen it says you are chosen people we are chosen I am chosen so these are the these are the big parts of your identity
14:21
you are you are new meaning You Are Spiritual the past you
14:27
physical your old identity was super physical the way the world identifies one another you were doing it the worlds
14:34
where you were identifying yourself the world's way now you are new your new identity is spiritual not
14:40
physical not the world's way of identity you're a new creation you are a child of God you are pure you
14:49
are the righteousness of God you are being transformed into His Image to look like Jesus on this Earth Hallelujah
14:56
and you are royalty that's a powerful identity huh
15:03
amen isn't that a powerful identity I don't think we need any other parts to
15:10
our identity I think that's pretty good don't you think so not pretty good this is the truth this
15:15
is what I want to tell you this is your identity
15:21
your new creation your child of God you were pure the righteousness of God
15:27
you're being transformed into his image so you're in the image of God and your royalty
15:34
this is your identity you don't need other things to identify
15:42
you the world has its way of identifying themselves
15:47
some of you have been identifying yourselves the world's way you have to get rid of that old
15:55
identities because it's holding you back some of you is holding you back some of
16:01
you is keeping you from walking in the calling that God has for you some of you is actually keeping you in bondage some
16:07
of you is keeping you from glorifying Jesus with your life it's a very serious deal I have a serious message today
16:14
serious message today we are getting rid of our old identities today
16:20
so I want you to know what I just shared to share today get this in you take notes this is recorded on live so you
16:26
can go back write the notes get it in you this is who you are this is your
16:32
identity not other things from there once this is our main identity that every single one of us has
16:38
as children of God now from there there are other parts that God can add
16:45
but these are the core parts of every one of ours identities from babies to
16:51
elderly male female this is our identity then God can add more on our identity
16:57
now God also created men and women male and
17:03
female he distinctly made two different Sexes and he made them um part of the reason to populate the
17:09
Earth he says that Adam and Eve to go and populate the Earth be fruitful and multiply right now Paul
17:17
says you know sometimes some people have a calling to be single on this Earth according to God's calling but many God
17:26
wants people to marry it's God's will for them to be married and to populate the Earth Hallelujah
17:33
so God's created men God's created female and so
17:40
he's made men to be men and female to be female he's made men to be masculine
17:46
female to be feminine and so when he's made us as he's made us we also need to
17:55
be sensitive to the Lord with how he wants us to represent ourselves and
18:00
present ourselves as men and as women amen
18:07
also there can be um callings there will be callings that you may have in your life like for example me I'm an apostle
18:14
that's that's a calling I know God has given me for sure there's no question there's no doubt it's my purpose here
18:21
on this Earth and so that's a part of my identity now that was added by God is
18:27
I'm an apostle Hallelujah so there's there's these other parts that will be added
18:34
onto your identity but that's it what I just mentioned and of course
18:39
you'll be mother you'll be father that's part of your identity you have children spiritual mom spiritual father
18:46
but this is it the world has a million other identities going on
18:51
and this is what we're going to talk about today to get rid of all these other identities
18:57
that the world has put on you or you have put on yourself because we've been living in the world and we go like the
19:03
world many times without being spiritually minded so what I just shared with you this is your
19:08
identity not your wealth status not your skin color
19:14
not where you come from where you are born where you live
19:19
not what other people call you not the clothes you like to wear the
19:26
fashion style you have none of that is your identity your identity is you are a child of God
19:34
you are royalty you are pure righteousness of God you are a new creation Hallelujah okay but the world's
19:41
way the world's way like in the world the world has their way of identifying
19:47
of putting identities on people on themselves and this is looks like this
19:52
people will identify themselves based on their preferences their desires
19:59
their giftings their talents
20:04
in which ways that they are unique they will identify themselves because
20:11
they want to fit in somewhere to a certain people group to belong some to
20:17
feel like they can belong somewhere and be accepted and be understood
20:23
they identify themselves a certain way to feel confident
20:29
and they identify themselves based on their feelings
20:37
did you catch that so this is the world's way that we need to
20:42
get rid of off of ourselves now
20:48
what I just named it's it's all these things I just mentioned is based on feeling
20:56
it's the way you're identified many times usually is based on feeling
21:02
um but what what I shared in the beginning right now what I've been sharing with what your true identity in Christ is is not is any of that based on
21:09
feeling none of that's based on feeling at all it's based on the truth which comes from the word of God
21:16
it's based on this spiritual truth that we believe in so we say yes Lord
21:22
I know a lot of us don't feel like royalty doesn't matter we don't feel like
21:27
royalty we say this is my identity because this is what God says
21:33
right many of us feel like Sinners we don't feel pure we don't feel like the
21:39
righteousness of God doesn't matter what you feel matters What God Says so you say I am the righteousness of God
21:46
I am pure Hallelujah so this is the world's way some of you might have
21:53
created your own identity yourselves like created your let me give you an
21:59
example this is very common in the world's way we like people in this world we always
22:07
feel like we want to we want to find what our calling is and we want to shine
22:13
in that area and we want to excel there and we want to be confident we don't
22:19
want to be wish washy we want to be able to tell people like yeah I know what I'm doing this is who I am these are my
22:25
plans I'm going places you know this is like how it is in the world
22:31
um and so there's actually this pressure for you to really find your identity and
22:38
be insecure in that and so when you don't know what I just shared with you the truth if you're not in Christ or if
22:43
you are in Christ and you don't know what I just shared with you you're going to be trying to make your own identity
22:49
because of pressure for the world because it makes you feel good makes you feel secure makes you feel confident
22:55
um and so let me give you an example for my myself I grew up
23:01
um in middle school and high school I remember that I did really well in school I was like got good grades and
23:07
everything in every area and I was just like I was like good at a lot of things but I I didn't I didn't really enjoy
23:14
school there wasn't one class that I just um like loved and I remember feeling
23:20
like man I really wish I really loved something what am I gonna even go to college for you know I remember feeling
23:26
that like pressure and then once it was time to apply for college I had to really think about it I was like I don't know what to do the only really big
23:33
passion I had was was singing was musical theater and so I remember going
23:38
to college okay let me look look for that and and I remember it was like a three percent acceptance rate that
23:45
people would they'd audition and get in so I was like oh maybe I won't do that so I remember just trying to find
23:51
something and I remember I ended up going for communications but I didn't really know I was thinking maybe event
23:57
planning I was trying to find something I was trying to find what career I should do and um then I went to school
24:03
for communications and and um I really miss singing and so
24:08
Midway through college I was I became a music minor started taking voice lessons and then I graduated and I was once
24:17
again like I don't know what to do I don't know what God wants me to do with my life and I was praying and at this
24:22
point I wasn't surrendered to God yet but I loved him and I did want his will this is before to encounter the power of
24:28
God because of the power of God that opened up my eyes to God's love that led me to be able to surrender to him
24:33
so here I was age 22 and long story short I felt God leading me to move to LA to
24:40
pursue acting so I came out here with no family here two acquaintances and I was pursuing
24:46
acting then I I as I got closer to God Once I arrived here
24:52
um my heart was was beating more to do something purposeful that really was
24:57
something that would really lead people to him and so long story short I I once
25:04
again realized you know what I think singing really is my biggest passion so I ended up pursuing starting to pursue
25:09
Christian Pop idiom music to be I wanted all of a sudden now I had found okay I'm
25:16
going to be a singer-songwriter pop idiom singer-songwriter Christian and um it was such a long journey from from
25:23
high school to I mean I went to school for communications thinking I was going to be an event planner then I graduated
25:30
and I thought I was gonna be a wedding I tried I was a wedding planner internship I had one time
25:36
um and then I graduated I was working at a restaurant I came out here I was gonna
25:41
be an actor and now this music and I and I thought finally I had reached it this
25:46
is what I was the most passionate about yet what I was the most excited about and things were going really well I
25:52
released singles and music videos and they went really well like the production of it was just amazing and so
25:59
many of my family and friends were saying like wow it's so amazing what you're doing you're gonna make it I was
26:05
getting like encouragement and support from acquaintances family of friends like I never had in my life before and
26:11
so I'm like finally I found it and I thought for sure this was God's calling for my life
26:16
um and I noticed that I started to identify myself as this you know I'm a singer I'm a Christian singer this is
26:21
who I am I'm a Christian singer like this is my identity right and then one day I encountered the
26:29
power of God my eyes opened up to God's amazing love I surrendered everything and I said Lord you can have my entire
26:36
life for the first time I give you everything I give you my dreams my plans my will I give you even my singing dreams everything I give them to you
26:43
and you can change them completely my plans if you want you can't I did that
26:49
nine months later God did that just that and nine months later I went to a
26:55
conference a prophet was ministering there he has a prophesying to me and says that I'm actually called to be an
27:01
apostle of Jesus Christ I'm called to reach the Nations and God will do many miracles through me and so
27:07
I received that word and I remember just being like what but I'm a singer what an apostle
27:14
what I'm a singer like that identity was in me of a singer and that now this this
27:21
new part of identity that God wanted to give me was I did not feel it at all
27:28
that was not me I'm not a preacher public speaking was my biggest fear and weakness and I had no desire to preach I
27:33
would watch preachers I love listening to preachers but at one time was I like I wonder if I could do that or maybe
27:40
because I love God so much maybe I should preach never did I think that not one time I didn't have a dream of it
27:46
nothing okay and but I'm hearing this but I in this moment though it was God it was
27:53
God's voice saying this is who I've called you to be and I didn't feel it there were zero
27:58
feelings I feel on a bustle In This Moment zero feelings it was completely
28:03
God saying this is who I've called you to be and in the world's way your identity is
28:10
so much based on feelings so it's so opposite the world's way and
28:16
the world's way this topic of identity we don't tend to think that it's super worldly we tend to think it's just
28:22
normal the way that we identify ourselves in this world like there are so many Christians who are identifying
28:28
themselves in a worldly way just because they don't it doesn't feel like it's a sinful thing
28:33
but it's really worldly it's not spiritual so I accepted the call to be an apostle because I just wanted to obey
28:39
God I just wanted to be in his will more than anything and I and thank God I knew the word of
28:44
God enough to know like this is how he is this is what he did with Mary this is what he did with Moses he just says do this for me people have their own plans
28:51
they're like okay I'll obey you I didn't see this coming but I'll obey you so I
28:56
thank God I knew the word of God God reminded me of Moses and I said yes Lord okay I don't know how this is going to
29:02
happen and I remember feeling so uncomfortable um when I accepted that call and the
29:07
months later I remember like you're an apostle and it felt weird I'm like doesn't feel like me like I feel like a singer and I remember I was sharing my
29:14
testimony on social media and all that support I had from all my friends and family and acquaintances it vanished
29:20
like pretty much completely and I could tell everyone thought I was weird and I could tell everyone was like what in the world has she gone crazy
29:27
like she's a singer like she's really talented at that like her music videos her single she's put out they're really
29:32
good like she's not a preacher I never heard her speak one time but she's gifted as singing so this
29:38
doesn't make sense is she crazy like I pretty I'm pretty sure people didn't really say that outright but I'm pretty
29:44
positive like a lot of people felt that way about me like that knew me they themselves had already put an
29:51
identity on me she's a singer that's her biggest gift she's a singer that's who she is
29:57
preacher apostle but this was God's true identity for me and me myself I didn't now I'm in this
30:04
uncomfortable place I'm like I felt confident and I enjoyed singing and now
30:09
I'm over here like receiving God's call and like this is before even the church started but in
30:15
that in that time of first receiving the call and before the church started even when I started preaching and we started
30:21
having Services I did not feel like an apostle
30:26
I felt like a singer I didn't feel like an apostle I didn't feel like it at all but it was
30:33
my true identity part of mine true identity
30:40
but like this word I'm sharing with you is so important because
30:46
the world's way is like what feels right is the right way where do you feel happy that's what you
30:52
should do you love to sing the most then that's definitely what you're supposed to do okay try this out what you feel God is
31:00
calling you to do to be an apostle to preach try it out how do you feel if I was that way I would not be here right
31:06
now I've been gone a few months ago a few years ago from preaching because I didn't feel like an apostle
31:13
for a long time I didn't feel like an apostle for probably years probably not until about
31:18
when the Revival started breaking out I which was like a year and a half ago probably for three to four years I
31:25
didn't feel like an apostle but it doesn't matter what I felt
31:31
I remember like pretty early on God wanted me to change my my name on like
31:37
Instagram I was like at Catherine Crick and I I want me to change that at Apostle Captain Crick I'm gonna buy oh
31:44
that was so uncomfortable I felt so weird doing that I felt because it didn't feel like me it felt
31:50
like a lie or something you know I felt like I doesn't feel like I feel like but it's I had to believe
31:56
this is what God this is who God says I am so this is who I am it doesn't matter how I feel
32:02
and so this is how it is with god with with everything with god with your identity God wants to put passions and
32:08
Desires in you God wants to to mold your heart and give you his desires there's so many of you that that have yet to
32:15
receive even desires that God wants to give you like for his people for example like the passion that God has for his
32:21
children God wants to put that in you even much stronger than you have now there's there's different passions that
32:28
God wants to birth to put in you but it doesn't happen with you just sitting around and waiting for it
32:35
it happens with you accepting what God has called you to accepting his desires
32:40
accepting his will accepting his identity over you and choosing to walk
32:45
in that way choosing to walk in obedience in that
32:51
way so like I would show up to preach for so many weeks and I wasn't like
32:57
[Music] people are going to be touched by the word and I'm so excited about how people
33:02
are going to be blessed by the word I didn't feel that way I felt I don't really want to do this
33:12
for a long time but I would show up and just do it anyway I would show up and I would love
33:19
people by showing up by doing what God called me to do I would spend time with God so he could
33:25
give me a word for his people that was me loving people and I didn't feel it I didn't feel like oh I'm so excited for
33:31
them to receive this word you know but as I kept showing up as I kept
33:37
showing up as I kept just walking in my identity without the feelings
33:43
hi I'm Apostle Catherine I don't feel like it I'm fossil Catherine and I'm doing the Apostle things I'm preaching
33:49
I'm praying for people I don't feel like if I'm doing it God call me too as I kept showing up
33:56
this gave God permission to put his hands in my heart and mold my heart to
34:05
put new desires passions in me
34:11
he put He put his passions and Desires in me
34:16
that then made me start to feel like an apostle that then made me start to feel so much
34:23
love for his people that then started to make me feel like wow I have this Revelation that that if
34:30
I can step out if I can speak a word of God it's going to bless people and touch people if I can pray for people God can
34:37
move through me and heal them and deliver them I want them to be healed I want them to be delivered this heart this passion started to come in me over
34:45
time not immediately not overnight over time
34:51
so now today here I am and it's been um like six years six years later after I
34:57
was first given that new part of my identity as apostle and I could tell you I feel like an apostle
35:04
Hallelujah I feel like my identity and and the the
35:10
things that God calls me to do as an apostle to preach to heal the sick to cast out the demons to to sacrifice a
35:16
surrender to surrender my life to work hard for him all these things I feel like doing it I mean not always of
35:23
course we're you know it's not all about feelings but by and large I feel this is
35:28
my identity you know this is it's an amazing
35:35
transformation that God has done in me when it comes to my identity but it didn't happen with a blink of an
35:41
eye I didn't wake up one day and be like I feel like an apostle
35:48
it did not happen like that it happened with me surrendering everything me
35:54
surrendering my identity of a singer my passions of a singer and I can tell you
36:00
now that God has I still love to sing and I'm so grateful God has me singing in silver in the worship time and
36:07
creating music sometimes still we have five F worship but truly I'm more
36:13
passionate now preaching Healing The Sick casting out demons doing the work of an apostle I'm
36:19
truly more passionate doing that but it's a supernatural thing that had taken place
36:25
by me surrendering to God by me giving up my desires my preferences my opinions
36:31
my identity my past identity so there's some of you that you've
36:37
created your own identity like I created my own identity even with the music I remember as I told you I remember being
36:44
like I wish that like I was just I just wanted to be a doctor like and I'm so good at math and science like I remember
36:50
thinking like I wish that was me you know I was all over the place I didn't really have this one big passion but it
36:56
actually was God so it was beautiful it was like I wasn't surrendered yet but that was there I remember coming out
37:02
here to do acting I remember being in the acting classes and everyone was so much more passionate about acting than me and it bothered me I'm like I guess
37:09
maybe this isn't isn't my calling or I don't know what's wrong with me so then I went for the music but still it seemed
37:14
like other people were more passionate about the songwriting and everything so I remember I remember even kind of like
37:20
trying to make myself be more passionate about music trying to like make this identity come on me more I remember once
37:28
I found it like yes I think finally I found my Colleen I remember like purposely you know putting my eyes to it
37:34
more get trying to make my yourself more passionate about it what I'm trying to tell you is that we in this world we
37:40
tend to like create our own identities that are not like singing is not a bad
37:47
thing it's not some evil thing it was Christian singing It's not some evil thing but it wasn't from God that
37:53
identity I put on myself was not from God it was me Conjuring it up in my own
37:58
because I thought I need to figure out what I'm gonna do I want to be successful you know I want and I want to
38:05
I want to make a difference in the world I want to reach people be a vessel of God through what I'm doing so I gotta
38:11
find something let's you know amen does anyone relate yeah this is the world's way so we have
38:18
to be really aware with what we've done in our own identity how we put it on ourselves so number one the world's way
38:25
of making your identity on yourself is creating your own identity like the
38:31
example I just gave you of my life but then secondly another way that the
38:36
world has identities is based on the devil's influence
38:46
the devil I'm telling you is out there to shape people's identity
38:51
so that it would not glorify God so that people wouldn't receive freedom and healing and walk in Abundant Life
38:59
so that he can get them to go his way and bring him glory that's what the
39:04
devil's after the devil is sneaky and he is out to mold people's identities so we have to
39:11
be very aware that we are not of the world at all we are not adopting the devil's influence over our identity and
39:20
I'm going to share some examples with you of how this can happen there is so much power in words
39:29
there's so much power and words and in society there are stereotypes
39:36
a certain skin color is a certain way behaves a certain way or has a certain income level for example if someone has
39:42
a certain fashion style or a certain career they're automatically gay or
39:48
something you know the society has these groupings
39:53
they said if you're like this this makes you this
39:58
this is from the Devil this is the devil trying to shape
40:04
people's identities to not be of Christ but how he wants them to be it's a sneaky way he's he's infiltrated
40:10
Society and so let me give you an example of this people who identify as homosexual
40:15
and once again hear you you hear the word identify this is all over our society what do you identify as a child
40:21
of God what do you mean you know it's all over Society what do you
40:27
identify as you know so even that's wrong you know it should be child of God now all these
40:33
other things but people who identify homosexual I've heard many many stories it seems like
40:39
even most I'm not sure the exact I'm who knows the exact percentage but it seems
40:44
like most they have a very similar story similar testimony of an abuse or a sexual abuse
40:52
or molestation happening when they were young when they were a child what's happening there is is when an abuse when
40:57
a molestation happens we know that's an open door for for the devil right so what happens is the devil knows what
41:05
has happened and the devil strategically can speak things to that child even and sexual things there's been people who've
41:12
come here that have said that they've renounced sexual desires and thoughts they've had since a very young child
41:19
that's demonic that's the devil coming sneakily in and speaking
41:26
those those thoughts and desires they had were not themselves it was the devil coming in their mind inserting those
41:33
things that they thought were their own thoughts and desires so there are some children who had these
41:40
desires that felt very natural but they weren't like natural they were coming from the enemy in the Mind through the
41:46
thoughts speaking you should like the same sex that find that attractive in different ways
41:53
the devil will try to mold identities in that way uh in different ways such as like you know God didn't give every man
42:00
the same tone of voice you know what I mean like all men do not need it
42:09
but Society has shaped it this way that if a man has a little bit higher than
42:14
voice than what they consider normal that they're homosexual and also who says that if a man has a
42:22
talent of like cutting hair or something that makes them homosexual
42:30
but there's there's so much I'm just giving you a couple examples here but what happens is the devil has has put this in society
42:38
that if a person is like this they must be this and so therefore even young children
42:46
start speaking these words over people you're gay you're homosexual
42:52
they speak these words over them and you know there's power in the tongue
42:58
if that's spoken over you tons of times as a child the child is going to think this must be true and at the same time
43:04
the devil knows what's being spoken so he strategically puts thoughts and Desires in the mind in the heart and the
43:11
mind this is how it happens all having to do
43:17
with the devil influencing identity through people's words through how
43:22
Society is and through children and adults not knowing how the Devil Comes sneakily through the thoughts
43:29
your thoughts are not all your own so many of your thoughts and desires are
43:35
sent from the devil it's not your original thought your original desire
43:41
uh amen but when you accept them as your
43:46
natural thoughts and desires when you accept the word spoken over you you are allowing the Devil to form this identity
43:53
over you where it really I mean fully feels like you completely like you
44:03
so this is what we have going on in the world today the devil influencing people with their
44:09
identities not knowing what's really going on thinking that it was just naturally it's
44:14
just how I'm born it's just how I was created I've been this way since I was a child well the enemy has been working
44:20
there could be generational curses is why he was able to speak such things or open doors happen at a young age
44:27
you know I even had this question I did a q a this a few days ago on the live
44:33
and I and I was asking questions people had spiritual questions and somebody asked this they said
44:39
I'm autistic and I'm afraid I'll lose part of my identity and what that what I think they meant by
44:46
that is that once again there's a stereotype I've heard this that people
44:52
with Autism have been like genius or genius or Geniuses like I think maybe Mozart or something I don't forget who
44:57
but people in the past have been like very smart and been autistic and everything so the world says
45:05
that if you have autism you are very gifted so it's actually a blessing and the world says the unability to
45:12
socialize correctly and problems in the mind that's actually okay it's just
45:17
different it's not different it's demonic it's not Abundant Life and Jesus wants to free his children of issues in
45:24
the mind of inability to focus and think straight and speak God wants to free as
45:30
people of that but look how demonic it is look how the devil has come so that people would accept bondage
45:38
calling it beautiful the genius the giftings is from God
45:47
the autism the spirit behind it the inability to think straight focused
45:52
problems in the mind is not from God it's sickness it's demonic and Jesus
45:58
wants to free his children from that and Jesus is doing that now Jesus has been
46:05
delivering so many children from autism there's been like five or six or seven
46:12
testimonies of children being healed being so transformed within like a month or so
46:18
there's been they just keep coming and faith is building faith is growing Hallelujah you can read those
46:24
testimonies later after service it's on my story I just put it up but it shocked me what I put on my story I wanted to read it to you right now because it
46:31
shocked me it amazed me of Jesus of how powerful he is because so I shared this
46:37
video testimony of this woman last Sunday testifying about how her son's been healed him and transformed so much
46:42
ever since joining the zoom live of autism and then um as soon as I posted the video like
46:48
immediately there's a woman who commented and she said I went to Myrtle Beach Revival is now
46:56
which was like a few weeks ago and I brought my drove like six or seven or eight hours and I drove my I brought my
47:02
son who had autism and if I got afraid for him and he's transformed I forget if
47:07
if he was saying words now or what but he's been there's there's transformation that's happened in his life Hallelujah
47:15
and then and then another person immediately commented on her comment and said
47:21
Apostle Catherine she prayed for my son and he was not speaking at all he was
47:26
just saying sounds and now he's speaking words and the the speech therapist is saying
47:32
it's like his mouth is being awokened is Awakening now
47:40
yeah healing children of with autism and so so these things whether it's autism
47:45
whether it's any kind of mental illness whether it's any kind of other sickness where people have said they're just
47:52
different they're just different it's important we don't call what's bondage just different
47:57
it's important we see it for what it is and we see God wants to get rid of that God wants more for you
48:05
amen God wants to heal you and deliver you and you get to keep your gifting you get
48:11
to keep your Genius your your intellectual smartness you get to keep that because that's from God they don't
48:17
come together amen hallelujah
48:22
hallelujah and then the last example I want to give to you about how Society shape this is how Society is doing the
48:28
devil coming through Society the last example I want to give you is um like maybe certain a certain maybe
48:36
Nations or even it could be areas of the city it could be areas of La so certain
48:41
geographic location um sometimes can speak over you if it's a
48:46
if it's a like a impoverished Nation if it's a third world country there is this identity many times of
48:54
society placed over you that you are poor that you will remain poor
49:00
this is your life and so like example let's say you're in a third
49:05
world nation and everyone around you is like that is dressed a certain way
49:11
you know and it has that attitude of like we're not gonna go further than this our whole past
49:18
Generations have been in poverty we're going to be in poverty too and then people don't even like try people don't even have a hope you can
49:24
even see it in different nations like America here there is a in general there's a
49:30
place where there is hope where you can come from nothing and become something great right that's all over the nation
49:37
and so it's kind of infiltrated society it's infiltrated you see it with like small businesses you see it with
49:43
customer service like there's a standard like customer service they treat you while they smile here in
49:49
America they treat you well it's because people here they want to work hard
49:55
they believe that if they work hard and they work with Excellence that they will go farther they have hope they believe
50:02
and so therefore they work hard they're living in that like identity right if you go to other countries though like
50:08
I've been to some country some countries in in example Africa it's you can you can literally feel that identity that is
50:15
put over them you can feel like some people not like
50:22
putting forth the effort you can feel that there's not like this hope there's not this expectancy and zeal
50:31
you know and so this is what society's put over them
50:37
so this in terms of poverty we cannot be we cannot accept this
50:43
we cannot accept as if your past Generations have been poor you can't you can't walk in that identity your royalty
50:51
greater is he that is in you than than anything in this world in any circumstance so if you're surrounded by
50:59
all these impossible situations if you have generations and generations behind you of poverty and and you've been stuck
51:05
in poverty you've been in debt and you don't even see hope around you greater is he that is in you than all of the
51:12
obstacles then all of what looks impossible around you nothing is impossible when you know who you are
51:22
when you know who you are walk in that I can do anything through Christ I am not
51:27
poor I am royalty I will not be stuck in poverty I am royalty of God and I will I
51:34
have an an inheritance from God as a child of God and that is Abundant Life
51:42
so these are just a couple examples I've given you right now of how the devil specifically has come through Society to
51:50
try to identify you in hopes that you would identify and you you say when you accept all these things
51:56
you are missing out on God's Abundant Life you are stuck in bondage and God is not getting the glory okay
52:02
so now what we need to do First Corinthians 6 19 says do you not
52:08
know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is within you whom you have received as a gift from God
52:14
and that you are not your own property
52:20
you are not your own property you are not your own
52:26
you are not your own you belong to God your temple is the Holy Spirit
52:35
so what you need to do if you want to be surrendered to God if you want his
52:41
identity how he wants to be over you you need to surrender everything which
52:48
includes the things you've held onto as your identity
52:54
your preferences your opinions
53:00
your desires your likes your passions
53:07
things that make you happy simple joys of life
53:13
everything you need to surrender to God
53:18
if you want his perfect identity to be over you
53:26
as I shared with you before I did not have this passion and desire to be an
53:31
apostle before but God put it supernaturally in me as I denied myself
53:38
as I lay down my passions that were not bad passions but I laid
53:44
them down and I walked in obedience over time God did The Impossible and put
53:51
these brand new passions inside of me that's what God wants to do for many of you
53:58
there are some of you who have had um homosexual desires passions preferences
54:06
in all aspects of the word um even like even how you dress and
54:12
everything that God wants to you to surrender that to him so he can birth completely new
54:19
passions and Desires in you that are his where you will represent him how he
54:26
wants to be represented in every aspect of the word represent physical how you
54:33
speak socially every aspect of it and that he would even he could even birth passions in you that you can never
54:39
imagine having passions for the opposite sex if you've never had passions for the opposite sex god can do that if God can
54:47
put these passions that I had not at all in Me God can do the same thing for you
54:52
for any kind of passion that's out there God can do it and there's some of you that God has
54:57
created God has a plan for you to have a family for you to have children and to bring so much joy in your life and the
55:03
devil wants to want to rob you of that that you don't need to let the devil rob you of that anymore but you have to
55:09
surrender everything to God and he will give you tears you
55:15
you couldn't ever having that come from him that bring you more joy that bring
55:21
you more joy than the life you had before that's the Trap that the devil's put
55:28
upon people who who are in homosexuality because they feel happy that they feel themselves there but what God has for
55:36
them the identity that God has for them the plans he has for them the passions and desires he wants to put in them are
55:42
so much greater will bring so much more happiness peace and joy
55:52
and that's the that's the that's the heart we need to have as as um as people of God
55:58
that we want that God wants more for his people not that God wants to to fix somebody or to
56:05
change some you know God just wants more God wants better
56:12
that's his heart and that's the heart we should have so we're not being judging amen because
56:18
there's been so much judgment that's come to people who identify as homosexual
56:24
they they feel so judged we need to come with this heart in the spiritual realm that God just wants more
56:31
want some more he wants better and I want more for you because I know the Abundant Life God's
56:37
given me and I want Abundant Life what that looks like for you Hallelujah
56:44
and so in terms of our identity there's so many
56:49
parts that go into our identity and I want to talk even it should translate from from even into the Physical Realm
56:54
like even how we present ourselves we we should ask God how do you want me
56:59
to present myself Lord I can tell you what he doesn't want you to look like you don't care
57:07
he don't is the mind to look like a slob why because you represent him
57:13
we're called to be the light of the world if I'm dressing and walking like this
57:19
how am I being attractive for people to even want to talk to me
57:25
but if I look like I respect myself if I look like I care
57:31
if I look like presentable I'm not saying we have to spend tons of money on our clothes I'm not saying that just put
57:36
presentable we become even a greater light for God we're shining brighter we're making
57:42
people to God uses anything to get people's attention
57:48
God God can use anything to get somebody to look at your eyes and see the light of Jesus shining through your eyes
57:54
amen so this is what I've done with God I used to not dress how I dress now but I
58:00
really I guess God lord I wanna I want to represent you perfectly I want to represent you in a way that makes you
58:06
proud I want to look Royal you know I wanna I wanna represent you I want to
58:12
wear what you want me to wear and I've changed how I dressed
58:17
I was really intentional about it um being more professional I felt God
58:23
say I want you to be more professional or professional you know you're my my royalty and also
58:31
we as children of God also need to redefine what the world how the world sees the Christianity because the world sees Christianity as poor
58:38
but we're royalty we're Abundant Life in every area
58:43
more than enough we have more than enough that we were able to bless others not be beggars
58:50
so in that regard too God spoke to me I want you to represent yourself in that way
58:55
amen Hallelujah so this is how you should be in every area of your life every every
59:02
passion desire you have passion for fashion whatever give it to God how do you want me to present myself
59:08
Lord and and this is innocent and when we're men and we're woman we should be
59:14
masculine if we're men we should be feminine if we're women amen and that might not feel natural at all but we
59:19
surrender it to God because we want to present represent him
59:25
the best way that pleases him the most hallelujah what you need to do
59:31
is to remove titles you've identified yourself with that are holding you back
59:36
like homosexual autistic crippled paralyzed blind
59:43
death even if you even if you can't see or you're deaf if you're constantly saying
59:49
I'm a blind person I'm a blind person you're not you're not saying Jesus can
59:55
heal me you're saying the opposite we got to be careful with the words we're speaking over ourselves
1:00:00
amen so if you're out there if you have autism stop saying I I'm autistic
1:00:07
I'm autistic so stop saying it we have to shed our old identities
1:00:14
if we want God to put his identity upon us his true identity amen we have to
1:00:19
shed so today we're going to renounce these things the words you've spoken Hallelujah
1:00:25
we have to shed these things number one also number two you could be like me five years ago
1:00:30
thinking yeah this is what I'm called to do be a singer that might be you in your life today but you might not be
1:00:37
completely positive that God spoke that to you you need to surrender that to God
1:00:43
I'm not saying turn away from that I'm saying so give it to God surrender it to God that's what I did and when I did
1:00:50
that it literally gave God permission to redirect to me you need to give God permission to redirect you if he wants to redirect you
1:00:56
so you need to surrender that to him today some of you have really identified yourself as a certain thing without God
1:01:02
saying like this is what I've called you to do surrender it to Jesus and say Lord
1:01:07
I give this to you if you want to redirect me if you want me to do something that I can't even wouldn't even enjoy it first and I'll be like
1:01:13
also Gathering like that I I I'll do it Lord I Surrender I just want your perfect
1:01:20
will your perfect identity over me amen
