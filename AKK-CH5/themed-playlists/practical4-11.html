the Bible says my ways are higher than
0:02
your ways God says my ways are not your
0:04
ways my ways are higher and the Bible
0:06
also says the heart is deceitful above
0:09
all else who can trust it that can make
0:12
you think ah how do I trust myself right
0:15
the scripture that says the heart is
0:17
deceitful above all else it's really
0:19
meaning like we are in a process of
0:21
being transformed into the image of God
0:23
and so the more we're being transformed
0:24
into the image of God the more we can
0:26
trust our heart the more our heart will
0:28
be aligned with God so that scripture is
0:30
not talking to mature Believers that
0:32
have been transformed but at the same
0:34
time the heart wants something it can be
0:37
a good desire not a bad desire like a
0:40
certain timing but God's timing is
0:42
different so you can be like I want this
0:44
right now and it's a good desire it
0:46
could be like the ministry to grow and
0:49
so I want this now but God's timing is
0:51
over here in that circumstance you have
0:54
this good desire but you could be
0:56
distracted by this good desire and start
0:59
to get depressed and annoyed and bitter
1:03
towards God when his will was just
1:06
different we have to always be aware
1:09
that God's will many times is different
1:11
than our will his timing is different
1:13
and so we can't trust our heart
1:15
completely we have to put all our trust
1:16
in God we have to know we could be wrong
1:18
sometimes also the scripture that says
1:20
my ways are higher than yours is the
1:23
same meaning you can have good beautiful
1:25
desires but it might not be God's timing
1:28
God might have a greater plan they're
1:31
higher his ways are higher I want to do
1:34
exceed Beyond whatever you can ask think
1:36
dream or imagine don't settle you you're
1:38
holding on to something but it's
1:39
settling I have more
