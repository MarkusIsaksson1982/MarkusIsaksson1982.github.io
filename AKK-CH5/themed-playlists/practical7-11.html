sometimes God doesn't heal immediately
0:02
sometimes the healing is taken place in
0:03
the spiritual realm and it's just his
0:06
will in the situation that it happens
0:09
over time just like the people who had
0:11
leprosy came to Jesus he said show
0:13
yourselves to the priests and the Bible
0:14
says on their way to the priests they
0:16
were healed so it was his will it was
0:18
his plan for them to not be healed
0:20
immediately in the presence of Jesus but
0:22
to be healed later they were healed in
0:24
the spiritual realm but didn't see it
0:26
physically till later so in the same way
0:29
for some people in some cases that's
0:31
just how God is doing it and many times
0:34
this is a way that God wants to test
0:36
one's Faith to see if you will apply the
0:39
principles he's taught and be obedient
0:41
and have faith and trust him and then of
0:44
course there can be some situations
0:45
where a key needs to be unlocked still
0:47
in the spiritual realm and then another
0:49
instance can be for the purpose of God
0:52
knowing one's heart and God seeing that
0:54
their heart has some growing to do and
0:57
God can see sometimes someone some
0:59
person will be led to go to a Ministry
1:02
where God's power is and and so much so
1:04
because they really need God's power
1:06
they need healing they need deliverance
1:08
and that's a big reason they go there
1:09
they love God yes but maybe there isn't
1:12
a complete surrender or complete
1:14
maturity in the heart so so much of
1:16
their motive is to receive the healing
1:19
and freedom their number one motive
1:21
isn't to seek God and serve him period
1:25
their number one motive number one
1:27
desire is to receive healing and
1:28
deliverance and maybe number two to
1:30
serve God and so even though one loves
1:33
God truly but maybe they've not grown to
1:37
a place where God needs them to be so
1:38
God can see in the spiritual realm that
1:41
the devil will tempt them to to leave
1:44
the ministry where God's power is once
1:46
they have received their healing and
1:48
freedom God can see that sometimes and
1:50
so God is really saving a person from a
1:53
life that's where they were deceived by
1:54
the enemy and they're not surrendered to
1:56
God he's really saving them by not
1:58
bringing the complete healing or Freedom
2:01
immediately because he sees ahead what
2:03
would happen and so he uses that like
2:06
desire and seeking for complete healing
2:08
and freedom and them keeping on coming
2:11
to change them to begin to transform
2:14
them until they are ready they are ready
2:17
to be completely healed and freed he
2:19
sees that they won't go away once they
2:21
are healed or freed that's not every
2:22
situation there's many people that can
2:24
come to the church and they're not not
2:26
even surrendered to God but God's power
2:28
hits them and they're so convicted
2:31
they're so enamored by God's love that
2:33
even though they're a baby Christian
2:35
they're not going anywhere so it's it
2:37
just depends on the situation God sees
2:40
these things that we don't know that we
2:42
don't see so that's why we just trust
2:43
him that's why if we don't see a healing
2:46
manifests immediately we don't blame God
2:48
we don't question God we just trust him
2:50
and we just do our part the simple part
2:52
that we have of just believing him and
2:54
obeying him doing what he has told us to
2:56
do applying the principles his
2:58
principles and his word and we leave the
3:00
rest to him we don't go and try to
3:02
figure out we don't go and be consumed
3:04
with like confusion of why we're not
3:06
seeing it happen yet we just trust him
