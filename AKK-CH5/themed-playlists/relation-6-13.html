today I'm going to teach you how to be a friend of
0:05
God and how to have true intimacy with
0:13
God probably half of you or most of you or all of
0:19
you are currently or in the past have struggled to know how to have
0:28
a real relationship with God anybody relate just not knowing you hear this
0:35
language relationship intimacy but you were
0:41
left not knowing what that means or how to have that I know that was the case for me and
0:50
I ended up feeling very insecure about that years ago I would hear other people
0:56
I would look at other people even just people preaching about it how a relationship with God just preaching
1:02
those words and feeling like I was missing something there was something wrong with me I wasn't a good enough
1:08
Christian I would sit and be quiet and wait for God to speak and many times it
1:16
just remained quiet and I've kept feeling shame and condemnation what am I
1:22
doing wrong and and I heard this language and I didn't know what does it mean though
1:28
to have a relationship sh with God how do I do this I want to do this but
1:35
how I'm going to teach you today I'm going to teach you today and how I'm going to teach you is through
1:41
the word of God it actually teaches you in the word of God how to have a
1:48
friendship with God it actually teaches you did you know
1:53
that it really does many people have struggled with this insecurity not knowing how to have
2:00
a relationship with God because God is a
2:06
spirit God is a spirit he does not come physically as a
2:15
human like he did in the times when Jesus first walked the Earth our relationship with God is in
2:22
the spirit and honestly many of you and this
2:27
was the case for me the only relationship you've ever known
2:33
is with a person a physical person and so you don't know how to have
2:40
a relationship with God because honestly a physical person
2:46
your relationships that you have with with people a lot of it's pretty much based on the physical not
2:55
spiritual I mean it's based on sight sound touch
3:01
like if a person does not smile at you probably you won't decide to be friends with
3:07
them right um
3:14
but what makes you have intimacy and grow closer and and know that someone loves you and you love them back is they
3:22
smile at you they they show warmth and love in the sound of their voice
3:31
their eyes light up when they see you they run to hug you in a physical
3:40
embrace you share laughs together and the words that you speak
3:47
you hear physically you hear you hear audibly so if you really think about it
3:54
your relationships are based on the physical right
4:01
so this is a big reason why people struggle in knowing how to have a
4:06
relationship with God because they're projecting their relationships with people upon God and that can't work
4:13
because your relationship with God is Not based on the physical it's based on the spirit based in the spiritual
4:21
realm amen so the first thing I want to share with you is
4:29
you're going to keep feeling insecure about your relationship with God if you keep measuring your relationship with
4:36
God with your me relationship with people since you're projecting it it's
4:42
really different and you got to accept that otherwise you'll feel condemned
4:50
you'll feel disappointed you'll feel like you're never measuring
4:56
up John 20: 27 says then he said to
5:03
Thomas this is Jesus speaking to Thomas and this is this is at a time when when
5:09
Thomas was doubting that Jesus had returned after to the Earth after he had
5:15
been crucified and resurrected he came back upon the Earth and he was doubting
5:21
when the disciples were saying Jesus he's here Among Us and even Jesus came
5:27
in the flesh and Thomas he could Thomas could see but he still was having trouble believing so then he said to
5:33
Thomas put your finger here and look at my hands put your hand into the wound in
5:39
my side don't be faithless any longer
5:44
believe my Lord and my God Thomas exclaimed then Jesus told him you
5:49
believe because you have seen me blessed are those who believe without
5:57
seeing me so this scripture is actually Jesus is
6:04
saying it's easy to believe when you experience me with your physical
6:11
senses on a regular basis but you know that you can't please
6:18
God without faith that's the only time it is talking about pleasing God directly in the Bible it says
6:25
this so the the way that you're going to be the most powerful vessel of God and be
6:32
able to do all that God has called you to do is is based on your faith the stronger your faith the more you can do
6:38
for God in his kingdom the more you will be in his
6:45
will so faith is the most important thing to God that you have
6:51
faith so even your relationship with God your relationship with God is based upon
6:58
faith amen so even your relationship with God
7:07
the reason why you know Jesus could keep appearing physically he could come in
7:13
your room in as a physical person appearing physically just like he did with in the scripture with Thomas and
7:20
the disciples he could he's God he could absolutely easily appear to you appear
7:26
to every single person in human form physically there could could be an appointment for an hour per day or
7:31
something where Jesus did that and you heard his Audible Voice and you could hug him
7:38
physically you could see his eyes physically looking at you he could do
7:43
that why doesn't he do that it would be so much easier for us to have
7:49
relationship with God right it's because he wants your faith
7:54
to grow so even he uses your relationship with him as a way to make
8:02
your faith grow so that's the reason that that Jesus says blessed are you who believe
8:10
without seeing who believe without touching my hand how many of you would want to touch
8:17
Jesus's hands right now physically and be like Thomas we all would love that but Jesus
8:22
says that we're more blessed if we don't if we don't do what Thomas did
8:29
why are we more blessed because our faith will grow more the more that we
8:35
choose Faith instead of our feelings like God says I want my
8:41
relationship with you to be based on faith you know sometimes you don't hear
8:47
my voice and I'm I'm using this moment to stretch your
8:53
faith it's not that I'm not speaking I already spoke and I actually want you to renew your mind with what I spoke I'm
9:00
still speaking it I want you to go in the spirit I want
9:06
you to be more spiritual to have intimacy with me that's what I'm doing when I'm when it seems like I'm
9:13
quiet and so that's choosing Faith so God wants you to choose Faith
9:21
so that you can be more spiritual so that you can be more transformed into God's image so that he can use you more
9:28
powerfully
9:35
amen and God gave me this Revelation one time because
9:42
um sometimes I think people feel insecure when they haven't had a
9:48
vision heard God's Audible Voice had this wild encounter they hear
9:58
stories from other people that they're Experiencing God like this and because it's it because we're stuck on physical
10:06
things like if a person hugs you rather than not hugging you if you feel them physically rather than not you feel
10:12
closer you feel like the person loves you more if the person says I love you
10:17
with this voice and you hear their voice you feel like the person loves you more than if a person says I love you and it
10:24
whis you know or you don't hear it so so we project that upon
10:29
God we hear people that are having many Visions apparently and a lot of people is
10:36
actually the angel of Light so I'm not saying that every time somebody says something it doesn't mean that that's true like every time they're saying I'm
10:43
having a vision I heard Audible Voice D angel of Light is definitely there sometimes
10:50
because God wants your faith to grow and have your relationship be based on faith
10:56
you have the choice to say yes to God in that you can say no to God you have
11:03
that Free Will Choice that's Disobedience to God you can Instead try to have a relationship with God in your
11:10
own way you can Instead try to hear God's voice in your own way you can
11:15
instead be stubborn and be like I need a vision I need to hear God's Audible Voice I need to have a dream tonight I
11:23
this makes me feel closer to God when I have the dream the vision the Audible Voice so therefore I'm praying and
11:29
praying and praying and praying that I have this rather than praying simply to hear God's voice however he wants to
11:38
speak so you know even even if it seems spiritual it can be
11:44
manipulating when you understand God's ways so you're being forceful to to hear
11:51
God in your own way when you do that it's Disobedience it's out of God's Will and
11:58
whenever we disob obey we step out of God's will we open up the door to the enemy so that's one of the ways that the
12:04
devil masquerades himself as an angel of Light if you are being so forceful about
12:11
hearing God your own way like through Visions through dreams through Audible Voice through a some sort of encounter
12:19
where you can feel something where you have a physical tangible feeling it opens up a door for the angel of
12:25
Light the Devil masquerading Himself as an angel of Light which those of you that don't know what that means it's in
12:31
the word it says this where sometimes the go that the devil can sound like
12:36
God he can but it's not God speaking it sounds spiritual but it's not and you
12:42
know it's not when you have wisdom like the Pharisees they were
12:47
apparently hearing from God that Jesus was a false prophet and apparently they were hearing
12:55
from God to persecute him get him arrested and and crucify him they were not hearing from God they were
13:02
hearing from the devil sounding spiritual kind of not really
13:07
though you know what I'm saying hallelujah so the Devil Comes
13:13
masquerading himself in an angel of light in a way that's not
13:20
pure in a way that's disregarding wisdom and God's
13:27
ways right so when so anyways back to what I was saying I was saying how you
13:32
can you can hear people say I had this wild encounter I had this vision and the
13:37
next week you hear again I had this vision and then I hear God God told me this God told me this God told me this
13:43
and you can feel insecure like why aren't I having those
13:50
experiences but but today we are going to the word of God to understand what a
13:55
relationship with God is supposed to look like and so we're starting with the scripture blessed are you now this is
14:02
New Covenant New Testament this is after Jesus this is after Jesus was crucified and resurrected he's speaking this so
14:09
he's speaking this to you blessed are you who believe without
14:15
seeing so so so those of you that haven't had Visions Audible Voice it
14:23
could indicate that God can trust you
14:31
he couldn't trust Thomas he said oh Thomas is just going to be led astray If he if if I don't let
14:37
him touch me right it could be that God sees that you are more
14:44
spiritual You Are Spiritual enough to have a relationship with him based on
14:50
faith without needing to have all these physical tangible
14:56
experiences that's not to say that if when a person if those of you here have had Visions have heard the Audible Voice
15:02
is not to say that you're less spiritual no no no no it it it depends it depends
15:08
but I do know that God's not going to be speaking every single day a vision Audible Voice
15:15
it's going to be more rare but what I what I am saying to
15:20
encourage those of you who have never had a vision who don't have that many
15:26
spiritual dreams who have haven't had this wild physical tangible experience
15:33
several times with God it could be actually that God can trust you with
15:41
more that you are choosing you are not manipulating him to hear him in his own
15:46
way you're not being forceful about it you are not doubting you know though
15:52
it's uncomfortable sometimes when it feels quiet for example but you are choosing to obey him you are Cho
15:59
choosing to trust him you are choosing to keep your faith in him that he's
16:04
truly with you and hears you and is guiding you in his perfect will you
16:09
choose to believe that day by day so God sees he doesn't have to show you his
16:16
hands and have you put your hands in his
16:21
side blessed are you blessed are you so here if your
16:27
relationship with God is based upon faith and most of the time you're not
16:33
having these physical tangible experiences but it's more of this
16:38
knowing that God is with me and loves me and you're hearing him but not in these
16:44
wild out ways but a still Small
16:50
Voice you are blessed blessed are you you're on track
16:57
there's nothing to worry about there's to feel insecure about you should have a Godly confidence
17:03
actually about your relationship with God Amen Hallelujah First Kings
17:12
1911 first Kings 1911 says um this this
17:17
story speaks of Elijah that God was going to appear to Elijah and um oh there it is go out and
17:26
stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord for the Lord is about to pass by then a great and powerful wind tore the
17:31
mountains apart and shouted the Rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind after the wind there was an earthquake but the Lord was not in the
17:36
earthquake after the earthquake came a fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire came a gentle
17:47
whisper so it's like the god literally wasn't in those
17:55
things so you can change so you can change this to then a great powerful wind of a vision
18:04
came and And Then There came in the the fire a uh an audible voice but it was
18:11
the angel of Light or a strong thought in the mind but it was the angel of Light you know but the Lord was not in
18:19
that he was not in the dream he was not in the vision he was not in the Audible Voice he was in a in a gentle whisper a
18:26
still small voice so what we generally just being of the
18:33
flesh we want to we'd rather have the earthquake Wind and Fire it makes us feel like we're closer
18:40
to God that's just natural it's and we kind of equate it to God's passion for
18:46
us too wrongly like earthquake when fire is
18:52
like like if I'm God I love you
19:00
I love you I love you we want to hear that when
19:08
God's
19:13
[Applause]
19:20
saying so is the whisper less than God it's just as much God as if he were
19:26
to come in the earthquake Wind and Fire just as much God that's where he was not
19:32
in the other things Matthew
19:45
171 before we go to the scripture before we go to the
19:52
scripture um God wants God wants all of his children to
20:00
have amount of transfiguration experience it's such a powerful
20:06
spiritual experience that it it transcends to even the
20:12
physical as a foundation to lay your faith in God to make this strong faith
20:19
this knowing in God I remember for
20:26
me a the baptism of the Holy spirit and prophetic
20:31
words many years ago like around the time where I first
20:37
met my spiritual father and receiving the prophetic word from my spiritual father Prophet Dr Jord Davy um this is
20:43
like these were like man of transfiguration experiences uh it was so powerful how
20:51
God released his fire and my tongue was overtaken
20:59
and it was just so Supernatural to experience that Supernatural experience that transcended
21:06
even to the physical made my faith grow
21:12
massively it's like I had faith in God my whole life ever since I was a Believer my age
21:18
four um I had Faith but it was like I had 10% faith in God and then when I was
21:27
baptized in the Holy Spirit it was like 100% faith in God and receiving prophetic words that
21:33
Supernatural experience was even was more than
21:38
100% And I don't forget those moments those moments have changed me have shaped me have it's like your faith
21:44
grows and it stays there as long as you protect what you've received and treasure
21:51
it so my that one experience my faith shot up and as I did the spiritual
21:59
disciplines the spiritual principles of renewing my mind and remembering that
22:04
and pondering like Mary did pondering her wild
22:10
Supernatural experience with meeting the a the angel speaking to her right and then the the the Shepherds
22:17
appearing out of nowhere God sent us to to worship Jesus the Bible says
22:24
she pondered these things so she didn't need need to keep
22:29
on having an angel appear to her every day or once a week or once a year no for
22:35
in order for her faith to be to remain the same hi just one time but she needed to
22:42
ponder renew her mind meditate on the moment where her faith
22:48
shot up her eyes opened up and this spiritual encounter she had with Jesus was so powerful that it transcended even
22:54
to the physical amen
23:00
so God wants us to have these experiences it's very important because
23:05
that's what leads to surrender is when we have these burning bush moments um baptism Holy Spirit moments
23:15
Deliverance healing powerful Touch of God's power where you fall back fall to the
23:20
ground uh Angel appearing to you experienced Mount of transfiguration
23:27
experience God wants to bring this this encounter with his power that's so
23:33
mighty to to build this great Foundation of your faith but he but he doesn't want you to
23:41
need to have this again and again and again and again the purpose of him coming in this
23:48
Mighty way is to build your faith it's not it's not having to do with relationship it's to build your
23:55
faith your relationship is based upon faith Faith
24:01
amen so we're going to the word of God today to see how to have a relationship with God so now we're going to go to
24:06
Matthew 171 and and what I want you to see here
24:12
is that this is the story of the Mount of transfiguration so after six days Jesus
24:18
Took with him Peter and James and John his brother and led them up a high mountain by themselves and he was
24:24
transfigured before them and his face Shone like the sun and his clothes became White as light and behold there
24:30
appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with him and Peter said to Jesus Lord it is good that we are here if you
24:36
wish I will make three tents one for you and one for Moses one for Elijah he was still speaking when Behold a bright
24:42
Cloud overshadowed them and a voice from the cloud said in an audible voice this
24:47
is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased listen to him so this man of
24:54
trans Transfiguration is like a wind earthquake fire experience or like Angel
24:59
appearing to Mary experience but do we read in scripture
25:05
them having the man of transfiguration experience once a year once a month once
25:10
a week daily nope it was one
25:18
time acts 109 the next day as they were on their journey and approaching the city Peter went up on the housetop above
25:25
the sixth hour to pray and he became hungry and wanted something to eat but while they were preparing it he fell
25:31
into a trance and saw the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending being let down by its Four
25:38
Corners upon the Earth so here is an example where we see
25:43
Peter having a vision but what's interesting is for
25:48
both for him and all the disciples we are not reading in the Bible about people having visions yearly weekly
25:55
monthly daily really when you read the word of God
26:01
this is telling us that if it was important for us to have visions like all the time we would see it in the
26:10
word this Vision was based on was the purpose of this Vision the vision had a
26:16
purpose is what I want to say first of all the vision had a purpose and the purpose was for God's
26:23
assignment to be done through Peter he was specifically speaking to him that he
26:28
was needing to go to someone who needed to be saved and baptized and prophesied
26:34
to so this Vision had a purpose this Vision wasn't wasn't about relationship with
26:41
God does that make sense and I say that to you because what
26:47
God is delivering you from insecurity of your relationship with God
26:52
today God wants you to get this out of you because you're not having these this
26:58
wrong Doctrine you have in your head of because you're not having all of these physical windfire earthquake experiences
27:04
that means that God doesn't love you as much as other people or you're not a good enough Christian you're not doing good enough God wants to take that out
27:12
of you today amen hallelujah um also we see that John had
27:19
a vision and that's how he wrote Revelation a vision of the heavens a
27:24
vision of the end times amen and but once again this
27:31
Vision had a purpose for this assignment that this Apostle had to do this
27:38
fivefold Minister had to do this very important assignment it it wasn't about
27:44
relationship with God
27:50
Amen but by that I mean it's not it wasn't necessary like I'm giving you this Revelation for our relationship I'm
27:57
giving you this vision for our relationship God doesn't want you to
28:02
think you have to have these things happen anymore to be close to him to have intimacy with
28:08
him
28:15
amen so what we find in the word of God is that a relationship the relationship
28:23
with God should be based upon Faith that's what I shared in the this
28:29
first scripture John 20:27 with Thomas blessed are those who believe without seeing me and he's talking about seeing
28:37
physically and experiencing physically so we see there that a relationship with
28:43
God should be based on faith through this scripture we also see it in um
28:49
James 2:23 and the scripture was fulfilled which says Abraham believed God
28:59
and this Faith was credited to him by God as
29:06
righteousness and as Conformity to his
29:12
will and he was called catch this the friend of
29:20
God remember today we're going into the word to find how we can be friends of
29:26
God here we go Abraham was called the friend of God
29:32
because why he believed
29:39
God and and God saw he this Faith made him righteous the Bible says his faith
29:46
was credited to him by God as righteousness and as Conformity to his will so God saw that him choosing to
29:52
believe in God believe what God was saying not doubt not complain when he
29:57
has to wait through the valleys but simply believe respect God's
30:04
word and simply just believe it God took that as Conformity to God's
30:14
Will and so therefore he was a friend of
30:20
God because he believed God he was a friend of God I want you to
30:28
know today having a relationship with God is not
30:34
difficult God didn't make it to be difficult if you can simply believe that
30:40
Jesus is Lord you can have intimacy
30:45
relationship with Jesus every
30:51
day no matter what age you are no matter how much Bible School
30:58
you've taken or how much of the Bible you've read no matter what your IQ
31:04
is every one of you can have a relationship with Jesus it's not hard this is the biggest part right here
31:12
believe how to be a friend of God believe believe the words that he speaks
31:18
stop doubting stop when when the promise hasn't come to pass
31:23
yet just keep believing don't doubt don't don't don't meditate in your mind
31:30
doubt don't speak the words why hasn't this happened yet where is
31:36
God this should have happened by now I'm sick of waiting don't speak those words
31:42
that's not counted as Faith you can feel those feelings but don't speak those feelings you can feel
31:49
those feelings and immediately meditate on God's
31:54
truth and that's what God God sees your heart he counts as faith and he calls you a
32:03
friend
32:12
Hallelujah acts
32:17
1322 God removed Saul and replaced him with David a man about whom God said I
32:26
have found David son of Jesse a man after my own heart he will do everything
32:34
I want him to do so these words are powerful God is
32:40
saying David is a man after my own
32:47
heart when you hear those words that sounds like friend of God
32:53
yeah that sounds like best friends with God
33:00
that's what Intimacy in relationship is is when you are not selfishly being a friend that's just using your
33:08
friend right but that you are after their heart you want to touch their
33:16
heart you think about what would bless them and you do it you be a servant have
33:22
a servant heart put them first that's when they're becomes
33:29
intimacy that that's when it becomes a real
33:34
friendship rather than you using them and that person's not feeling any love they don't even consider you a
33:46
friend so being a man or a woman after God's heart is how to experience
33:53
intimacy also and friendship
33:58
God is defining this what does it mean to be a man after my own heart it's defined by doing everything that God
34:06
wants you to do it's defined by
34:13
obedience I I I say this that I like to say this God gave me this Revelation
34:19
that obedience is God's love language now this is really different
34:27
from what a lot of you might have been taught by Christian culture today by religion
34:32
by old wine what most people think of relationship with God is they they they
34:39
they're thinking more about religious rituals they are thinking more about
34:45
praying for a certain amount of time um doing it as a ritual and praying
34:54
in these words that sound fancy but aren't your the way that you
35:04
speak you know speaking in KJV language praying in that kind of way
35:12
praying in a way you would never speak but it's like your heart is
35:17
focused on the ritual doing what I need to do to check
35:23
off the box I'm being a good enough Christian so I can have right
35:28
and God can bless me and I can go to heaven that's
35:35
religion but being after God's heart is really looking at what is actually
35:40
pleasing him what is actually touching him looking at God as a person not as some like just a figure that doesn't
35:48
have a heart or a brain God made us he made us so he made us in His image
35:57
so he has has a brain he has a heart and so it's quite silly to be
36:02
talking to God in a way that's like talking to someone who's not a
36:10
person the most intimacy you experience with friends are and your spouse if you have
36:17
one or family members is by being real amen speaking
36:23
from the heart not being fake so if you want to experience intimacy
36:30
with God that's how it has to be as well that you would speak from the heart when
36:35
you pray but above all that you would be after his heart that you would make
36:43
obedience to God the most important thing in your
36:48
life not religious rituals not praying for a certain amount of time a certain way that
36:53
sounds spiritual
36:59
but but obedience would be the greatest part of your the most important part of your your
37:05
life amen
37:10
hallelujah the reason why the reason why uh obedience is God's
37:18
love language so important to him is
37:24
because we're here for a reason he could have just just created us and put us in
37:29
heaven and that was that but he created us and put us here why did he put us
37:35
here to do a job we are here every day to do a job to
37:40
be on assignment for God and that assignment is to release his power his
37:46
love to the world to reach the lost to release his
37:52
to testify and speak that he is alive to spread the good news that he is alive that he is our
37:59
savior and King and Lord of lords and he's also healer and
38:04
deliverer amen so we are here to advance God's kingdom by doing these things and
38:12
destroy the devil's works and that's God's
38:17
heart God's whole heart is for his people his whole heart is for you is for
38:25
all of his people it's different than maybe your hearts currently or how your hearts were in the
38:32
past and the hearts of the friends around
38:38
you your heart may be divided or the relationships you're used
38:43
to having maybe their hearts are divided partly for God partly for
38:49
selfish ambition dreams partly for things that will satisfy the flesh partly for this TV
38:56
show partly for for partying partly for looking really
39:05
good the heart is divided and then there's a part that's for God and so many of your relationships
39:14
are based on divided hearts and so you shop with your friends
39:19
you watch TV with your friends you gossip with your friends and then you go to church once a
39:26
week that's what your relationship looks like is your relationship with God going to
39:32
look like that so to be a friend of God we need to
39:40
be after his heart God's calling us to be really
39:45
looking where is his heart his heart is not on all those things and okay you can have you can
39:53
have hobbies and things and he cares about those things don't get me wrong but his heart is so passionately for his
40:01
people that's his whole heart and so if you want to experience
40:08
intimacy with God you get got to come up to his level get in alignment with him God gave
40:16
me this uh example this this example to help bring this understanding to you
40:23
today okay imagine imagine you know Billy Graham
40:30
right okay imagine Billy Graham's life I recently went to his Museum so it's on my mind like his his life was serving
40:38
God all the time I mean he was ministering here there everywhere
40:44
Stadium events to millions of people at one time sometimes he was on TV shows he was on
40:51
radio shows he was for Jesus he was so active so busy for the
40:59
kingdom he didn't he I don't believe he had much of a social life I believe he
41:04
made a great sacrifice in his life for the
41:09
kingdom and he had a wife but I'm sure I know she had to go through a lot of
41:14
sacrifice he was traveling a lot more like their relationship had
41:20
great intimacy I believe I don't know from experience I'm just saying I believe I I mean I don't I didn't talk
41:26
to them or hear from I'm just saying I believe they had great Intimacy in love and relationship it's not like he was
41:32
just always doing his own thing no they had intimacy but it looked way different than a lot of your
41:38
marriages or or or or how you dreamed of your marriages to look
41:44
like some of you have in your mind what your relationship what intimacy with your with your spouse will look like
41:51
like if you're not married yet you have this fantasy this dream and it probably
41:56
looks like at least three to six hours per day looking in each other's eyes and
42:03
cuddling and and holding hands and walking going for walks right I mean you have in your mind
42:11
you know and vacations all the time and just a lot of time but I bet that Billy
42:17
Graham's wife had to make a sacrifice and not have that kind of life like that right but but look but that was God's
42:25
will for Billy Graham that was God's will for his wife right and they still experienced
42:31
beautiful intimacy but it looked different both of their P their passions were to serve God and Advance the
42:38
kingdom and so imagine this is a little bit funny
42:45
example but I just want you to to just imagine this imagine someone like Billy Graham
42:52
like male version female version God was calling you to marry
43:02
them just imagine that male or female version like him that was their
43:12
life what would you have to do you would have to compromise you would have to
43:17
come up to their level if you really want to experience
43:24
intimacy with that spouse you can't stay where you're at you can't be whining
43:31
because they're not binging Netflix shows with you every night
43:36
cuddling right if you're whining about that and
43:42
you're complaining and you're like down cuz your marriage doesn't look like you expected it to
43:49
look guess what you're not going to be experiencing intimacy with that
43:55
person and that person person is going to is not going to they can love you but it won't be the kind of love that they
44:02
would have if you were after their heart it wouldn't be real
44:09
intimacy so what do you need to do to experience intimacy you need to come up to their
44:16
level not try to bring them down to your level you need to
44:25
mature and the the scripture we just said where it says that I just read
44:31
David was a man after God's heart he conformed to God's will it
44:38
says he conformed to God's will it says he's a man after my own
44:44
heart conforming conforming to my will and purposes
44:50
conforming if you would have to conform come up to The spouse's level
44:58
in order to experience intimacy so if you want to experience
45:03
intimacy with God I'm not going to tell you go pray this
45:11
amount I'm telling you conform to God's
45:17
will it it says in [Music] um it says in Matthew
45:24
158 this people honors me with their lips but their heart is far from
45:31
me in vain do they worship me teaching us doctrines the Commandments of men the
45:38
religious Commandments of men this is how you have a relationship with God this is how you please
45:44
God pray this amount do this do all these
45:50
rituals so that's what it's like that's why my message to you is that some of you are looking for that well what's the
45:56
exact amount of time I need to pray what's the exact amount of times I need to fast what's you're looking all there
46:02
and you're going down the religious route down the wrong path where God could be end up saying to you this same
46:08
thing they're not close to me in heart though they honor me with their
46:13
lips it's a lie it's not real and this is what we see in the parable of the tax
46:19
collector of the Pharisee and the tax collector there's a story in the Bible where uh the Pharisee says he's praying
46:27
these lofty prayers oh Lord I praise you oh you help me to be
46:38
obedient like I TI always and I fast this many
46:47
times oh yes he's praying this kind way and I am not oh thank you that you
46:56
helped me to be obedient to do these rituals so that I am not like this tax
47:03
collector sinner self-righteous um but the Bible actually
47:09
says that the the tax collector he actually went after God's heart to
47:15
summarize what happened he actually spoke from the heart not these lofty prayers not these self-right righteous
47:22
prayers not praying in a ritual way and living in a ritual way but honestly from
47:28
the heart he repents to God have mercy on me for I'm a sinner Lord he just
47:33
speaks honest from the heart he he comes after God's heart and conforms to his will and the Bible says that the tax
47:40
collector was the one who was justified not the
47:47
Pharisee so this is common in the in the in the church today this is what God is trying to bring you out of out of that
47:53
old wine of this Pharisee way Pharisee way of having a relationship
47:59
with God Pharisee way of praying and doing the commands because
48:06
we are called to pray we're called to fast at times when Holy Spirit leads but
48:12
so many people are just doing these things to check off the Box doing them as rituals rather than first being after
48:18
God's heart when you're after God's heart then you can hear the Holy Spirit leading you how to do these things how
48:25
to pray how to fast the amount of time to pray when to
48:31
pray amen hallelujah so um going back to
48:38
Friend of God equals obedience friend of God number one equals faith believ in
48:44
God number two friend of God equals obedience so I'm going to read a couple
48:51
more scriptures that show that being a friend of God equals obedience Acts
48:58
13:22 or I'm sorry acts um acts
49:03
[Music] 15:14 by the way I read the NLT version
49:08
First of of of Acts 13:22 where it says he will do everything I want him to do
49:14
and then I read the Amplified version for your notes I read the second part of
49:20
Acts 1322 Amplified version says I have found David the son of Jesse a man after
49:25
my own heart in parentheses conforming to my will and purposes who will do all
49:31
my will amen now we're going to read There It Is that now we're going to read
49:36
John 15:14 it says so Jesus is saying this
49:42
you are my friends let's let's hear Jesus speak this to you right now amen
49:49
read this as that Jesus is speaking this to you directly you are my
49:55
friends if you keep on doing what I command
50:01
you I do not call you servants any longer for the servant does not know what his master is doing but I have
50:07
called you my friends because I have revealed to you everything that I have heard from my
50:14
father when you do what God is commanding you to do when you are after his heart conforming to his will God can
50:23
trust you and reveal his Revelations to you reveal more
50:29
things in the spirit to you remember the the disciples when they
50:35
came back from casting out demons for the first time Jesus said Jesus says to the father
50:40
I praise you father for you've hidden these things these Revelations of the spiritual realm and the revelations of
50:46
your Authority and what makes demons to go and how to access the anointing and how to adequately walk in the authority
50:52
and anointing you've only re you've hidden it to those who are wise and proud and and you've only revealed it to
50:57
those who are humble and childlike so a big part of humility and being childlike
51:03
means conforming to God's will being obedient amen so when you're obedient
51:09
now God can reveal to you deeper things of the spirit
51:16
Revelation because you have come up to God's level he can now be intimate be
51:22
more intimate with you and speak more things
51:30
amen John 14:21 those who accept my commands and
51:36
Obey them are the ones who love
51:42
me so God judges love he judges do they really love me are they after my heart
51:47
are they being intimate with me he judges it by those who accept my commands and Obey them this is New
51:55
Testament this is The Book of John notice he's not saying because they
52:02
do all of these rituals they love me because they do all
52:08
these rituals once or twice or three times a week but then do other things they love me no he says those who accept
52:14
my commands and Obey them are the ones who love me and because they love me my father
52:20
will love them so this is this is describing intimacy this is describing relationship
52:25
relationship is is when is God loving you and you loving him back and him loving you back and you loving him back
52:33
and you love and him loving you back continuously that's what relationship is
52:40
that's what intimacy is true love love from the heart love
52:48
not in just words but action amen
52:56
you know God loves everybody God loves everyone on this Earth more than any human can ever love
53:03
anybody everybody whether you're a sinner whether you're remaining in sin he loves [Music]
53:09
you but there are those who touch his heart and he pours more love upon more
53:15
favor upon more affection upon
53:21
right this is what this is the meaning of this here because because they love me my
53:30
father will love them now God loved us first so this is a different this is the
53:36
Revelation I'm giving you of the scripture it's not we love first then God loves but that scripture sounds like that it's because the scripture is
53:42
talking about the intimacy kind of love the Friendship type of
53:48
love not everyone is called friends of God in the Bible so God loves everybody but not
53:55
everybody's loving back and that and there won't be intimacy if you're not loving back it's one-sided and he keeps
54:02
pursuing until you come and then there's
54:09
relationship okay so this is this is how we went in the word to find what friend
54:14
of God means it means obedience to God then you will be a friend of God now
54:19
we're going to go to Genesis 68 it says but Noah found favor in the eyes of the
54:25
Lord the these are the generations of Noah Noah was a righteous man blameless
54:31
in his generation Noah walked with
54:37
God and another translation says that Noah walked in close fellowship with
54:46
God so because he chose to be obedient by being pure by denying his
54:53
flesh by pure Allowing God to transform him and make him
55:01
pure he then walked with God
55:09
hallelujah so how to have a how to have intimacy with God is being pure being
55:14
obedient in all ways being obedient to allow God to transform your heart get rid of all
55:22
those the dark things the evil things the dirty things the selfish ambition the jealousy The Pride reject those
55:30
things get rid of those things so God can transform you and and your heart can
55:36
be pure then you will walk with God be intimate with God I'm not saying you have to be
55:43
transformed before you can be intimate with God I'm saying every day take the step and you will experience
55:50
intimacy every day be intentional to purify your
55:55
heart to come with Clean Hands and a pure heart and you will experience Intimacy
56:01
in walk with God
56:06
Amen Psalm 25:14 says the Lord is a friend to those who fear
56:13
Him he teaches them his Covenant do you do you see do you see how the word of
56:19
God teaches us how to be friends with God isn't this powerful there's so many scriptures in
56:26
the Bible that teach us how to be friends so the Lord is a friend to those
56:32
who fear [Music] Him to those who have reverence have
56:39
respect have the fear of God another translation ESV says the friend the Friendship of the Lord is for those who
56:47
fear Him and He makes known to them his
56:54
Covenant so what also makes you to have intimacy with God be friend of God is having
57:00
respect respect when you have a great respect for God reverence for God that's
57:06
what gives you the ability to be obedient
57:11
always when it would crush you it would hurt you to disrespect
57:17
him to dishonor him by Disobedience when that's your heart you
57:24
will have the strength you will have the mental awareness quickness to obey obey
57:31
obey whenever God is asking you to that's the key to being obedient and
57:38
to being in God's will to have the fear of
57:44
God and you know that doesn't always come naturally all of these
57:50
characteristics fruits of the holy spirit that we're talking about today Faith obedience
57:56
OB the fear of God pure in heart it's all up to you it's a choice how that
58:03
comes is by Renewing Your Mind with the word of God resisting the devil rejecting all of
58:11
his lies all the funky feelings you have that are not these things of God reject
58:18
them close the doors that's influencing you in this ungodly
58:24
way meditate itate on God and his word and the things of
58:31
God meditate on the fact that it's so important more than anything that you
58:37
are obedient to God you never want to to disappoint him to step outside of his
58:42
will let him down you know you want to stay right on
58:48
track and touch his heart every day meditate on that make the intention
58:53
every day to meditate on that truth choose to have that kind of
58:59
Heart by choosing to think about these things and Renewing Your Mind
59:05
amen hallelujah all right so I was just talking about a little earlier how the
59:11
more we are pure we have the fear of God we respect God we're obedient now he can
59:17
see that we are trustworthy now we become friends and so now he reveals
59:23
more Revelations to us he gets more intimate with
59:28
us um and so it says here and he makes he he makes known to them his
59:35
Covenant he he makes promises with them
59:41
he makes promises with you he gives you beautiful promises for your
59:47
future amen James 4:8 says drawn near to God
59:55
and He will draw near to you cleanse your hands you Sinners and purify your
1:00:02
your your hearts you
1:00:07
double-minded so this scripture is answering the question how do we become closer to God how do we become intimate
1:00:12
with God draw near also as you draw near as you seek
1:00:18
him make sure you're coming with Clean Hands and a pure heart don't draw near in the Rel
1:00:26
religious ritual way where your words are honoring but not your
1:00:32
heart clean your heart and draw near seek God
1:00:38
Amen Hallelujah so how you draw near to God one of the big ways one of the big ways
1:00:45
is seeking him in his word his written word the Bible and the RMA word RMA means present
1:00:53
tense word of God spoken word of God so today you are receiving the RMA present
1:00:59
tense word of God you're receiving the prophetic word of God and it says in Ephesians 4:11 that Jesus when he poured
1:01:05
out his Spirit he gives gifts to the body of Christ Apostles prophets evangelist pastors and teachers and to summarize Ephesians 4 11-16 he gave
1:01:13
these gifts to equip the body to equip the Believers so to mature
1:01:19
you in other words to open your spiritual eyes to give you Revelation this is what the word of God has saying
1:01:26
this is the holy spirit's true revelation of the word of God you have old wine you have religious
1:01:34
doctrine of you're you're you're interpreting the Bible wrong this is what God means when he speaks
1:01:42
this you see like that's what's happening today there's a cleaning happening in your mind there's a removal
1:01:49
of wrong Doctrine a removal of wrong thinking a removal of the work of the enemy who's come in the angels of light
1:01:55
a rem removal of the work of the enemy that has brought shame condemnation all of these schemes to try to keep you from
1:02:00
having intimacy with God this word that's been brought forth
1:02:07
I is getting rid of that religious doctrine that many of you had about what it means to have a relationship with God
1:02:13
and you can never attain the relationship with God you can never attain intimacy you did ritual after
1:02:19
ritual and you felt further and further from God and you found no transformation
1:02:24
and you found yourself still lukew disobedient so today I'm teaching you
1:02:31
this is what God means I'm teaching you you probably have never heard a teaching like this but this is the word of God
1:02:38
you see you this is what it means to be a friend of God it's in the
1:02:43
word hallelujah and so you have drawn near to
1:02:50
God today you have seek Him the Bible ALS also says when you seek Him and seek him with all your heart then you will
1:02:55
find him so you're finding intimacy closeness
1:03:02
going deeper with him when you seek him so by you coming here today you are seeking him you are drawing near to him
1:03:09
you are hearing his voice he's been speaking today a lot today and he's still
1:03:14
speaking this is intimacy and this is so important you
1:03:20
know Ephesians 4 11-16 this is this is speaking uh that God gave the church
1:03:27
that God gave fivefold Ministry five full ministers to bring the equipping
1:03:32
you can't survive without this the Bible speaks we need this
1:03:37
equipping if we want to be mature we need this teaching this
1:03:43
equipping so this is one of the big ways you hear God's
1:03:50
voice so that you can be transformed so that you can your eyes can be opened up
1:03:55
so that when you go into the word of God yourself in your private alone time with
1:04:01
God you can actually hear him rather than the angel of Light like how the angel of Light spoke to the Pharisees
1:04:07
when they read the word of God you can now hear God's voice because
1:04:13
of the equipment you've received coming in the church so it's just as important just as
1:04:20
important as reading the Bible on your own time regularly it's just as important that you
1:04:26
received the teaching of how to read the Bible of how to hear God's voice in The
1:04:32
Bible and that's what happens every time you come here your spiritual eyes are opened up and this Revelation I'm giving
1:04:38
you now it's like I see prophetically like your eyes are opening up now to see God's heart before maybe you saw him
1:04:47
as like condemning you like you're not doing enough you're not praying
1:04:53
enough you know maybe you saw him that kind of way but now through this word your
1:05:00
perspective has changed you see that God's not that way at all you can you can see that God
1:05:07
hasn't made it complicated or difficult to have intimacy with him but he's rather made it very simple and you can
1:05:13
do it right now it's attainable for
1:05:19
you and and this is lifechanging from today from this word
1:05:25
you received today you'll read the Bible differently from today you will experience intimacy like
1:05:31
never before after today that condemning voice will be gone from today or you you'll reject it if it
1:05:37
comes because you know the truth now and you're set free
1:05:44
Hallelujah so how you come draw near to God reading the word hearing the word so
1:05:52
never miss out on church on Sundays never miss out on the teaching that's being released weekly if for some reason
1:05:59
on the week you're in different time zones you miss the live stream make sure you watch the
1:06:04
replay this is the action of drawing near to God this is the action of
1:06:10
intimacy intimacy not just in that moment it's not like okay I'm coming to church or okay I'm reading my Bible
1:06:16
today and these are the times I have intimacy no this is what helps you have intimacy
1:06:21
always this is what makes you more spiritual
1:06:28
I have um I've shared this some of you have heard this before some of you probably haven't but um when you speak
1:06:35
words of death when you speak words of death the devil can
1:06:41
hear not because he's
1:06:46
omnipotent but because in the spiritual realm it's as if you're speaking on the devil's frequency
1:06:56
I mean it's the action of agreeing with the Enemy and giving authority to the enemy so it's like it's like you are
1:07:03
opening the door like come on in in the spiritual realm and the the devil's able to come
1:07:09
and bring oppression when we open up doors the Bible says do not give a foothold to the devil if we do that's
1:07:16
how oppression comes so when you speak words of death it's like you're going on the frequency of the devil like how the
1:07:23
devil speaks where he's speaking his world like a radio station you are on that
1:07:31
frequency but also when you become more
1:07:38
spiritual with your meditation what you're meditating on and what you're speaking and your
1:07:44
actions you are coming more into God's
1:07:51
frequency by that I just mean it becomes easier to hear God's voice
1:07:57
it becomes easier to discern God's voice between other
1:08:02
voices it you experience more
1:08:08
intimacy the more spiritual you
1:08:14
become so coming this is why I say coming to church is so important hearing the messages all the time is so
1:08:20
important and Renewing Your Mind with them meditating on them listening to them again putting them into practice is so important this is how you become more
1:08:27
spiritual that example I gave you of having to come up to the level of The
1:08:32
spouse's spiritual maturity level what about God's spiritual
1:08:38
maturity level what about his spiritual maturity level you have to come up there you come
1:08:47
up there by becoming more spiritual by being
1:08:52
transformed more into God's image by Drawing Near by hearing the word and applying
1:09:00
the word amen hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus
1:09:07
praise God praise
1:09:14
God so we need to stay in the new wine and don't wander into the religion
1:09:23
land we need to come up to God's level and not by the way so I'm teaching
1:09:32
you how to intimacy with God so the more you're aligned with God's heart the more
1:09:38
intimacy you you'll experience the more a friend of a more of a friend of God you will
1:09:43
be so God's whole heart is for his people to know him
1:09:50
so the more you put your heart there the more intimacy you will experience
1:09:56
that's why obedience is such a big deal to God like that example I I gave of the
1:10:02
someone like Billy Graham like that was Billy Graham's Heart Right was God's
1:10:08
people and so the spouse for the spouse to come up to that level that would be touching his heart
1:10:14
so much the most right that's how it is with God but so
1:10:20
much more he's God not a human God
1:10:25
and so um God gave me this uh this picture this visual
1:10:32
yesterday so that you can understand God's heart so that you can be after it okay many of you have been oppressed and
1:10:39
you've been set free amen there are a lot of people in this
1:10:45
world that are oppressed they have a demon that's tormenting them
1:10:52
daily it is worse than living in a physical
1:10:57
jail prison and so God know because God has
1:11:04
his principles and laws and rules and ways that he moves so God chooses to use people to deliver them to preach the
1:11:11
gospel to them to release his love to be a vessel so he releases his power and love to them to open up their eyes to
1:11:17
his love so that they can be saved and come into the kingdom be free from the devil's torment
1:11:23
now and forever and have eternal life with Jesus and live in heaven with Jesus he chooses to use
1:11:29
people so imagine those of you that are parents imagine if and if you aren't
1:11:35
just imagine with me imagine if your child was um
1:11:44
kidnapped un unjustly in jail wrongly
1:11:50
convicted or very sick in the hospital
1:11:58
where is your heart as the parent your friend comes along let's go
1:12:06
watch Netflix together let's gossip over some
1:12:13
coffee let's go do these things how are you going to feel like
1:12:20
are you going to feel intimate with that friend but what about a friend who comes up in says I want to do everything I can
1:12:27
to help you to help you get your kid healthy out
1:12:33
of prison found right okay the way that a parent's
1:12:41
heart is feeling for that child in those circumstances God's heart is even
1:12:48
greater greater passionate um serious because those types of situations it's
1:12:54
serious so God's just not like I love my children he's loving
1:13:01
fiercely he's loving fiercely and so like literally every
1:13:08
single day God sees I Feel the Fire of God God sees I feel his heart God sees
1:13:15
millions of people who don't know him yet who are oppressed with
1:13:20
demons and God's eyes are on them
1:13:27
not on watching Netflix not on having a coffee
1:13:34
date God's heart is on them and and God knows he has the power to heal them
1:13:40
deliver save them it's not like oh well this is just how it is so might as well
1:13:45
go have the coffee date or whatever thing you know he knows he can
1:13:52
rescue them and deliver them but he has the way that he does it and it's through
1:13:59
[Music]
1:14:04
you so so it's like this is God's heart every day his heart is like this and his
1:14:10
heart upon is upon you every day because he's omnipotent his heart can be so many places in one time so his heart is
1:14:16
pouring love upon you I love you so much my son my daughter I'm proud of you I have such great plans for you I can't
1:14:22
wait to give you the desires of your heart because you've delighted in me I have so many blessings I'm ready to pour out upon your life I I I I love how I
1:14:30
created you you are so beautiful inside and outside I formed you in your mother's womb and I Delight in you every
1:14:38
single day every detail of you I love you my son my daughter he's doing that
1:14:45
every day he has the capacity to do that but sometimes we're trying to pull
1:14:53
God down to our level and we're wondering why we don't experience
1:15:00
intimacy when he's wanting us to come up to his level when he wants us to see his
1:15:05
heart rightly how he is loving with a fierce love his eyes are on all his lost people and he's wanting you to come
1:15:11
alongside him like how a spouse comes alongside their partner how can I help
1:15:17
you how can I help you reach the Lost deliver the oppressed heal the sick and so he's looking for he's want
1:15:25
his eyes are on these people all over the world that don't know him and he's wanting you to run and say send me let's
1:15:31
do this together Lord I'll be a vessel for you and when you and when you run to him
1:15:38
and Link arms with him that's the greatest intimacy there ever is you're close to him your hearts are
1:15:46
united you're looking your eyes are on the same thing on people who need him
1:15:52
you're United your hearts are aligned mind and you're doing work together the
1:15:59
most beautiful powerful life-changing work in the
1:16:04
world but if you're like I want to goip I want to watch
1:16:10
Netflix I want to have a coffee date with got God come on I'm not saying we
1:16:16
can't do these we do these things that's fine nothing wrong with coffee date nothing wrong with Netflix as long as it's something that's not
1:16:22
immoral amen there's a lot of that on there so you got to be careful so I'm not say what
1:16:28
I'm trying to say is we are missing God's heart and we're trying to pull him in
1:16:35
all these things and we're missing his heart completely and so we're not going to
1:16:41
experience intimacy amen
1:16:47
hallelujah and so as I shared this re this Revelation with you now you can see
1:16:53
why these as ects of what it means to be a friend of God why God is saying this
1:16:58
is my friend this one who's obedient he's my friend this one who's after my heart and he'll do everything that I
1:17:04
want him to do he's my friend this one who's pure in heart is not fake he she is my
1:17:13
friend this one who respects me who has the fear of God who who reveres me this
1:17:20
is my friend it's because God's heart is for his people to know him and all of those
1:17:27
things doing all of those things are the only thing that allows you to come link arms with God and lose your life lose
1:17:34
all of these other passions that you've put above God and above serving him but
1:17:39
you come you draw near to him and he can use you powerfully so you know God taught me
1:17:46
this like whenever I'm serving him whenever I'm like like right now you
1:17:51
know I'm talking to you I'm not talking to God I'm talking to you right now but
1:17:57
God's moving through me so we're doing it together I'm not here doing this on my
1:18:04
own and he's somewhere else and then at home tonight I go to my room and then I meet with him he's here with me right
1:18:13
now and together we're doing what he cares am about the
1:18:19
most so I'm experiencing intimacy with God right now
1:18:25
you are experiencing intimacy with God right now you are being obedient you are
1:18:30
hearing his voice you are listening he's talking directly to you so whenever
1:18:35
you're in obedience God wants you to renew your mind and see that this is the greatest intimacy there is so whether
1:18:42
the obedience is your personal prayer time and reading the word alone in your
1:18:48
room or whether it's taking care of your kids whether it's doing the laundry whe
1:18:54
whether it's cleaning the house whether it's loving on a friend whether it's serving at the church whether it's
1:19:02
sitting here and and being a good listener of the word whether it's Renewing Your Mind meditating on the
1:19:07
word and applying it all those different things God is asking you to do at different times on the days every day
1:19:14
but every time you're doing that you're experiencing intimacy with God you're experiencing friendship with
1:19:22
God and God wants you to renew your mind to that otherwise you're missing out on
1:19:28
that intimacy that's right there amen
1:19:34
hallelujah
1:19:40
hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus I could go on I
1:19:47
could go on and on about this but God wanted me to release this to you
1:19:53
as a foundation like this that you have received you'll be able to carry with you and know how
1:20:00
to pray and know how to read the word and know how to have relationship and
1:20:05
intimacy daily amen
1:20:11
hallelujah hallelujah
