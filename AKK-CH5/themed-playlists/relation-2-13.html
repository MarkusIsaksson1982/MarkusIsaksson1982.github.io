0:00
thank you Jesus so today I'm going to be teaching a message
0:05
called how to hear God's voice in the word
0:11
not how to read the Bible not how to be well
0:18
educated in the Bible but specifically how to hear God's voice
0:24
in the word Hallelujah I believe it will be a life-changing day
0:32
for you and you will hear God's voice like never before accurately after this word hallelujah
0:39
I'm excited it says in John 1 1 in the beginning was the word
0:49
and the Word was with God and the Word was God
0:55
the word or the Bible is God one of the biggest ways to hear God and
1:03
to have intimacy with him is by reading his word
1:10
but not reading his word any old way and that's what I'm going to teach you today
1:16
specifically how to really be able to hear his voice in his word and not just
1:22
read it and get nothing out of it or hear something completely different than what he means because that's completely
1:27
possible and that's really prevalent in the body of Christ today is misunderstanding the word of God not
1:36
hearing really what he's saying and actually hearing the devil in the word of God hearing what the devil wants you
1:42
to think the scripture means when you read the word of God it can go
1:47
different ways you can be a a person who doesn't believe in God
1:53
and you read the Bible and you are just reading it because you want to
1:59
learn about the Bible and the religion of Christianity
2:04
if you read it that way most likely you will not hear God
2:10
can do anything but usually if you're reading it with that intent just to learn but not having
2:18
faith you won't hear God's voice it will be just like a history book it
2:25
probably won't bring change in your life and you'll probably read it the wrong way and think differently about God
2:31
because your misunderstanding scripture then you can read it another way
2:38
which is so prevalent in the body of Christ today this way is reading it with religious
2:45
revelation I've been teaching a lot lately about religion and about the old wine skin the
2:52
spirit of religion and old wine skin so a big part of the old wine skin is
2:58
interpreting scripture with the spirit of religion just as the Pharisees interpreted the
3:06
word a certain way and a lot of it was not right
3:11
even though Jesus hasn't come yet a lot of it wasn't right they didn't have eyes to see
3:18
really what God meant really his heart really who he was then Jesus comes on the scene
3:23
and Jesus interprets the word differently the correct way one example
3:29
is he's healing people on the Sabbath and their him and the disciples are
3:35
doing work on the Sabbath sometimes and eating on the Sabbath things like this and the Pharisees accuse Jesus and his
3:42
disciples of going against the word of God of not obeying the law of you must keep this
3:50
sabbath but really Jesus was coming with a different revelation of what the Sabbath is he was not going against the
3:57
word of God he was coming with a new revelation of the Sabbath which is resting in God
4:06
that everything you do would be resting in God and yes it is good to take a day
4:12
off once a week but it's not a law sometimes God can call us to work every
4:17
day but we the important thing is that we rest in him that's the real meaning of Sabbath
4:25
so Jesus was not going against the word of God at all he was coming with a completely different and new revelation
4:32
of the word and the proper Revel the correct revelation of the word
4:38
so that's what I mean of this old wine skin religious revelation of the word
4:43
versus Jesus's true meaning revelation of the word which is the new wine
4:53
so today the same Spirit of religion that was feeding the
4:59
Pharisees to interpret the word wrong feeds many Believers today
5:06
The Same Spirit of religion feeds Believers religious revelation of the
5:12
word so many Believers are interpreting a lot of scripture
5:17
wrongly which means they're actually not hearing God's voice in the word it's actually
5:24
opposite it's actually the devil twisting the word and the devil's speaking some the opposite of what God
5:32
is saying this is a big deal we gotta get this right
5:38
we got to make sure we're really hearing God's voice in the word and we're interpreting scripture rightly
5:44
that's what you're going to learn today amen Hallelujah [Applause]
5:52
so and the first step to hearing God's voice in the word
5:57
is to receive the Holy Spirit which comes when you believe that Jesus is your lord
6:05
and savior when you confess that he is your lord and savior just by believing
6:10
just by having faith that's it salvation comes to you
6:15
Holy Spirit comes and lives inside of you now you have the Holy Spirit as your
6:21
helper he's living inside of you constantly able to speak to you constantly
6:28
so you have the ability to hear from him always so now when you read the word of God you
6:34
have the Holy Spirit to help you to bring you real true Revelation this
6:41
is what this scripture means so when you have the Holy Spirit that is
6:48
when you're going to begin to be able to really hear God's voice in his word
6:54
amen but having the Holy Spirit
7:00
that's not enough people have the Holy Spirit but they be
7:06
not living by the spirit not following the Holy Spirit
7:12
they be praying in tongues but they not be listening to the Holy Spirit
7:19
yeah right so you have to yield to the Holy
7:25
Spirit you have to be surrendered to the Holy Spirit obedient to the holy spirit so
7:32
when you read the word of God you must come with the intention
7:39
I want to hear God's voice I want God to have his way
7:47
with this meeting with him as I open the word
7:52
I want him to reveal to me what he wants I want to get true revelation
7:59
that means I'm giving him permission to confound me I'm giving him permission to
8:05
correct me I'm giving him permission to disprove me
8:12
my Doctrine that's what that means when you're really yielded to the Holy Spirit and
8:17
you open the word and you're like Lord I just want to hear you that's what I want more than anything
8:23
that means that you cannot come with the intention of a performance
8:29
like this religious performance I'm reading the Bible today because I made
8:35
this goal to get these numbers of chapters read every day and I have to do this and so you just read it fast and you
8:41
read it completely with the intention I just have to get through this so that's
8:48
um overshadowing the the intention of I want to hear God's voice
8:54
you could be going so fast and missing what God wanted to speak to you in the one one verse that he just wanted you to
9:00
read and meditate on it also means you have to get out all other bad motives like I'm reading the
9:07
word of God because I want to be really intellectual and knowledgeable in the word of God so I can look spiritually
9:13
impressive to others it also means you have to surrender the
9:19
bad motive get rid of the bad motive of I want to look in scripture and find
9:25
verses that will back up my theology
9:32
I really Hallelujah I really want to be able to prove that
9:37
I'm right on this subject I've got this one scripture now I'm on a hunt to fund others
9:46
a lot of people a lot of people are doing do that right it has that Spirit of religion again
9:52
that's that devil coming as an angel of Light again
9:57
the Bible says that the devil masquerades himself as an angel of Light meaning the devil can come sounding like
10:03
God sounding spiritual so you have to
10:09
get rid of all those bad motives or else you're not going to be hearing God's voice in the word
10:15
and you could even be hearing the devil in the word I mean that is what made Jesus to be
10:23
sent to the cross and be crucified is the the Pharisees
10:30
their religious Doctrine from the Devil that they were so confident in they were
10:37
able to prove it look he's going against the word look he's going against the word so the devil used the word of God
10:45
to get Jesus persecute and crucified
10:51
same thing happens today devil uses the same tricks
11:00
so this also means something else we better humble ourselves when it comes
11:06
to our uh confidence in our interpretation of scripture
11:12
we better not be jumping to be teachers of the word even leading Bible studies even leading small Bible studies we
11:18
better not be jumping there too fast and God says God warns about this the
11:24
teachers will be judged uh uh more like higher standard
11:30
so he says don't be quick to be teachers and the word of God it says that and and now you're starting to realize I
11:35
think what I'm sharing why it's so serious you could be hearing from the devil and
11:40
teaching the devil's what the devil wants through his word like he did with the Pharisees
11:45
that's really serious we have that happening throughout today when we see false accusations coming
11:53
towards anointed Ministers of God when we see exposed videos
11:58
every single time it's scripture scripture scripture scripture scripture Twisted Twisted Twisted Twisted Twisted
12:06
every single time they do it they do exactly what the Pharisees did they prove the Pharisees were on a hunt the
12:13
Bible says that the Pharisees would look to see where Jesus was gonna if Jesus was going
12:18
to go against the law they were on a hunt oh I can add this scripture to my
12:24
exposed teaching that's what happens today
12:30
so you got to be aware of this and not quick to listen to just anybody because it's as serious as the devil
12:37
could be given them their Doctrine twist in the scripture
12:43
amen this is a really serious deal
12:49
there's a lot of scriptures there's and I'm going to go over some of them in a bit but there's a lot of scriptures that
12:56
the spirit of religion has come and kept God's Will from going forth in the
13:02
body of Christ kept the leadership he wants to be there the the the Equippers that he wants to be there
13:08
because of these specific verses that have been Twisted by the spirit of religion
13:15
one of them has to do with women preaching and leading being in a place of of ministry
13:21
leadership and there is a really well-known pastor
13:27
who has a huge one of the biggest churches I believe in America Rick Warren
13:33
and he believed for a long time this
13:38
wrong religious revelation of scripture about women that they shouldn't uh be
13:43
pastors be in leadership he believed that for for many many many
13:48
years while he was leading a huge churches a huge Church
13:55
and recently God opened up his eyes and he publicly came out and said I was wrong
14:02
and now I've gotten the real Revelation from the Holy Spirit of this scripture and he apologized he apologized to the
14:10
body of Christ Hallelujah praise God
14:16
glory to God praise God for that beautiful humility you know so so so
14:21
others eyes could open up but so yeah so he he literally realized
14:27
I was flat out wrong about this and I had been teaching this and by teaching
14:32
this has been keeping um anointed women of God from being able to lead and preach and teach so that's a
14:41
really serious deal you know and and what that speaks to me is
14:47
if a if a pastor of a big church with a good heart you know
14:55
um if he can be wrong about
15:00
scripture what about you
15:10
so that that speaks to me that we better humble ourselves because even if we are not a pastor of a
15:19
huge church with many sheep under us even if you are teaching scripture to
15:24
one person but you lead them astray with your wrong religious revelation
15:30
that's a big deal we we don't want to do that huh amen
15:35
Hallelujah so you need to humble yourself and not become this biblical
15:42
expert okay um humble yourself and be ready for God to teach you new
15:49
things the new wine you don't Hallelujah you don't have to be a professional
15:56
um of the Bible overnight it is a journey the Bible is huge
16:03
it is huge and it's it it really takes
16:08
uh a journey with the Holy Spirit of opening your eyes layer by layer for you
16:13
to really grab the revelation it's a journey God doesn't give it to us
16:18
overnight you can't just say all right Lord I'm where the anointing is I'm
16:25
surrendered I want to hear your voice and now I'm starting on a year Bible
16:30
reading plan and by the end of this year I'm going to know the Bible perfectly
16:37
I'm gonna have the the exact Revelation from God in one year you know like now I know
16:43
ever because I have this intention that I talked about I want the Holy Spirit to speak I know that every verse I read I'm
16:49
going to get wild crazy revelation I'm going to know completely it doesn't
16:54
mean that we're on a journey you can't force God to give you tons of Revelation he gives
17:01
it how he wants little by little by little you do not need to know the whole Bible you don't
17:08
need to know the entire Bible even to to start teaching or to start leadership you don't have to know all
17:13
you're not going to be teaching the whole Bible in one sermon are you it's too much it's too much
17:21
for you to take in everything God wants you to really be able to grasp
17:26
one thing and then build upon that and he wants you to then really fully grasp
17:31
the next thing amen so
17:39
um so be patient be patient and and and don't
17:46
this is the other motive that you shouldn't have you should not have the motive of um
17:52
I'm reading and I'm gonna get wild Revelation today
17:58
let God do what he wants don't put pressure for yourself to get
18:03
huge revelation and sometimes God wants to
18:09
just share the story with you in the Bible a story of a Biblical character
18:15
um and he wants you to just get that in you he wants you to learn about it get that in you
18:21
and then maybe a week later a month later a year later he's going to speak to you
18:26
randomly about that story so he doesn't speak to you the Revelation as you read
18:32
but he does later so don't pressure God don't put pressure on God
18:38
amen don't put pressure just be patient and allow God to do what
18:44
he wants crazy Revelation or not let him speak to you how he wants
18:51
amen Hallelujah
18:58
by the way I am so grateful for people like Rick Warren who will
19:05
humble themselves it's so rare right thank you Jesus thank you Rick Warren
19:12
if you're watching this thank you so much I know so many people so many women are going to be
19:18
able to step in their callings because of what you have done and other men and men their eyes are now
19:26
opened up so they can receive like here like there's men here that God has called you to be planted here and to be
19:33
my spiritual Sons you know and so that's the case for other other men out there too for this
19:40
ministry and also women leaders and future women leaders and because he
19:45
spoke that now their eyes will open up and they'll be able to go where God has called them to be planted they'll be
19:51
able to go to their woman Elijah spiritual mother like Elijah
19:56
and be able to receive as an Elisha amen hallelujah
20:05
let's have more of that in the body of Christ amen let's have more humility
20:11
and repentance God lifts The Humble this is the way forward this is the way up
20:18
Hallelujah all right so number one I just shared
20:25
with you some big the overarching key to be able to hear God's voice is to
20:31
read the word with the intent to really hear God's voice whatever he wants to
20:37
speak even if that means correction without pressure no performance
20:43
um and then the second big part of being able to hear God's voice in the word
20:50
is to have an anointed leader a spiritual mother or father
20:57
whom you are learning the word of God from
21:03
Ephesians 4 11 it says God gave Jesus when he when he
21:09
ascended he poured out his spirit so after he is resurrected ascended to Heaven he poured out his Spirit to the body of Christ and he gave these gifts
21:16
and these gifts were Apostles prophets evangelists some pastors and teachers
21:21
the purpose verse 12 was for the equipping of the Saints for the work of
21:27
Ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect man to the
21:33
measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we would no longer be children tossed to and fro and carried
21:39
about with every wind of Doctrine
21:45
you get that so one of the purposes of the fivefold ministry is that we would not be carried about with every wind of
21:55
Doctrine wind of Doctrine means wrong religious teaching
22:02
wind of Doctrine means angel of Light speaking to you when you read the word of God and a big reason is because of
22:07
the past religious teaching you had
22:12
so we need the Fievel Ministry we need true anointed leaders you need two
22:18
anointed leaders to reveal who Jesus really is through the
22:24
word teach you the correct Doctrine this is what this scripture means this is what
22:31
this scripture means so that when you read the word of God you have that Foundation you have that
22:37
teaching of you have that Foundation of how to read the word of God and and and who God is and how he's
22:45
going to be speaking what his character is like by the way in the word of God when you
22:51
read the word of God what you when you're reading the word of God you find out who Jesus is
22:57
his character that's how we find out it's revealed in Scripture his character
23:03
his love it's revealed it's revealed by in the gospels how we see Jesus
23:09
interacting with people how we see him ministering how we see him preaching it's revealed in the stories of God's
23:16
faithfulness from the Old Testament to the New Testament how his great love his
23:21
great grace and mercy that when people mistake make mistakes his grace is there and they repent and he can redeem them
23:28
he redeemed them Hallelujah and we see in in story after Story of of
23:36
person of God after man or woman of God after man or woman of God from Old Testament into New Testament we see
23:42
God's faithfulness is perfect God's goodness is perfect God's love is
23:48
perfect we get to know this is who God is
23:53
he is faithful all the time not even 95 of the time all the time his love truly
24:00
is greater than any other love in this world than any other person's love we find this out by reading the word of God
24:09
Hallelujah and as you read the word of God another thing that happens is God brings Rhema Revelation Rhema a new
24:17
present tense word of God through the Holy Spirit sometimes through the Holy Spirit coming through a
24:22
teacher bring bringing more uh bringing more so one verse says this
24:28
but then there can be more that God adds on for more understanding
24:33
so we're not limited to the to the Bible but God expands everything aligns it's
24:40
coming from the word it's not isolated some random teaching it must align with the word
24:47
but God wants to bring more God wants to bring meat God wants to bring Mysteries God wants to bring secrets of the
24:54
Kingdom that comes by taking the limits off of him and allowing him to expand upon
25:01
scripture bring Revelation upon scripture that aligns with scripture
25:07
religious spirit doesn't like that beware of that religious spirit doesn't like that they
25:14
always will say but it's not in the word of God holy spirit is still speaking today
25:25
still speaking he's doing a new thing he's doing a new thing
25:31
we can't shut off his voice here and now today and only just read the Bible and that's it
25:37
we need his voice to breathe upon the word and bring more
25:42
there's more to him there's more to his kingdom there's more understanding that he wants to release amen
25:52
second Corinthians 11 4 it says Paul is saying to his disciples he's correcting
25:59
them rebuking them correcting them because he taught them the correct doctrine of who Jesus is of his heart of
26:07
his character the right Doctrine the right gospel the true Gospel of Jesus
26:13
uh he emulated Jesus he represented Jesus well with just his ministry
26:20
and also he spoke the true gospel spoke who Jesus really is
26:26
but then he corrects him here and he corrects his disciples in the scripture because what was happening is his his
26:31
disciples had been going on and listening to other teachers and these other teachers were teaching a different
26:37
gospel this could be a religious gospel religious Revelation gospel
26:44
coming from the angel of Light this could be we learned last week about how people think people think that Jesus
26:52
is judgmental and wants to bring fear and a judgment
26:59
fear judgment doom and that's how people Minister because that's how they think Jesus is
27:04
without Grace that's an example of of the wrong idea
27:10
of Jesus the wrong gospel that could have been preached that still is preached today but how the real true gospel is that God
27:17
is a god of love and compassion and forgiveness and Grace and it's the kindness that leads to repentance he
27:23
does not want to force his people to repentance he doesn't want people to come to Salvation because they're afraid
27:28
to go to hell he wants them to come to Salvation because they fell in love with him and they made the choice out of
27:35
their own free will so so that's an example of there's two
27:42
different gospels of Jesus right there one's right one's wrong so so that's what was happening there was different teachers speaking
27:48
different gospels different jesuses different Jesus and it says for you in Second Corinthians 11 4 for you seem
27:54
willing to allow it if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not
27:59
preached but who Paul is saying I have not preached and the other Apostles have not preached or you receive a different Spirit from
28:06
the one you received or a different gospel from the one you accepted you tolerate all this beautifully welcoming
28:12
the deception and so he's correcting them like why are you not saying planted because when you
28:19
uproot yourself and start listening to other teachings they're not coming with the true revelation of Jesus that I
28:26
brought you so don't go Here There and Everywhere and receive wrong teaching so easily
28:31
it's a big deal it's dangerous is what he's saying and I'm saying this today to you too
28:39
stay planted don't divert from the true gospel that you've heard taught here the true Jesus that has been
28:46
taught here Hallelujah so this is the importance of
28:51
having anointed leaders spiritual mothers spiritual father like how Paul
28:57
was to bring you he's saying I brought you the gospel I taught you the gospel
29:02
this is God's big way of revealing himself of revealing his word what his
29:07
word is meaning what the true Revelation that's a big way that God does it
29:13
is through who he's called you to be planted under that anointed leader bringing that
29:19
teaching to you so if it's done that way in the times of Paul it should be done this way today
29:25
right like he's bringing this gospel for you to hear and receive
29:30
and have revelation so here a big way that you get to know
29:36
how to read the word of God who Jesus is his heart is by coming here and receiving this
29:43
teaching anointed teaching amen also
29:50
um First Corinthians 11 1
29:57
well let's go to First Corinthians 4 first first Corinthians 4 verse 15. Paul
30:02
says even if you had 10 000 T others to teach you about Christ you have only one spiritual Father for I became your
30:08
father in Christ Jesus when I preached the good news to you so I urge you to imitate me that's why I have sent
30:14
Timothy my beloved and faithful child in the Lord he will remind you of how I follow Christ Jesus just as I teach in
30:20
all the churches Wherever I Go and then in First Corinthians 11 1 it says and you should this is Paul
30:25
speaking again and you should imitate me just as I imitate Christ
30:33
so God gives a special Grace you know it says in the fifo Ministries these are
30:39
Grace Ministries these are gifts to the body of Christ they were specifically anointed to have a greater understanding
30:47
and revelation of who God is in his kingdom to then give it to you
30:54
it's not withheld from you it's not only given partially it's given to you freely you've been given freely give
31:04
so it's not like oh they just get to have greater Revelation no it's for you
31:09
to have it's not with hell but you have to come
31:15
humbly and say I'm ready to eat I'm here to receive things that I don't know about God and his kingdom
31:23
I know my place you know and I have that respect and honor for the anointed fivefold
31:30
Ministries four but spiritual father spiritual mother that that God has given them a special
31:36
Grace Revelation and anointing to understand God
31:42
his character his heart and his kingdom
31:49
it says also in Matthew 10 24 a student is not Superior
31:56
to his teacher any more than a servant would be greater than his master
32:03
so that's just simply saying God has given this special Grace and anointing
32:09
and understanding Revelation to the fivefold ministers to your spiritual
32:14
father or spiritual mother for your good for for this to be the place where
32:20
you're hearing God's voice one of the big ways for your getting to to learn who really God is his character his
32:27
heart how he wants us to minister and be vessels of God and the complexities of
32:33
his kingdom this is a big place where you unlearn the wrong Doctrine
32:40
and so um so this is really important when you read the word of God for you to
32:45
be able to have revelation of scriptures you need to know God's heart that's
32:51
what's the most important thing you have to know God's heart and if you're thinking he's judgmental
32:57
if you're thinking he's nonsensical if you're thinking he's just someone that likes to make up random rules that
33:03
doesn't make sense because he likes to Lord those roles over you or a certain part of the population you're not going to be hearing God's
33:09
voice you're not going to be interpreting the scripture accurately amen
33:16
so you need to make sure you really know God's heart that's what's going to help
33:23
you understand the scripture the best because when the angel of Light or other
33:28
people try to say this is what the scripture means you can say no that's not God's heart God would never say that
33:34
God would never mean that by that scripture that's the most important part of being
33:39
able to hear God's voice in the word and that's one of the big reasons why you need this anointed leadership a
33:46
spiritual father a spiritual mother like Paul because he's saying imitate me as I
33:52
imitate Christ multiple times this is New Testament
33:57
this is New Testament so that means that that's that's how it should be today I should say imitate me
34:03
as I imitate Christ to you
34:09
and and this is just having this is just having to do with what I just shared about there's a special Grace and
34:15
anointing and Revelation given to fivefold ministers to to spiritual
34:21
fathers and mothers to understand God in a higher level
34:28
so that and that means also that they're going to be more transformed into the image of God
34:34
than their students their disciples right
34:40
so they're going to be looking more like God so so for you it's for you to look and
34:46
see oh that's what humility looks like
34:52
that's how to respond in a situation when people are coming against me oh I didn't know that I wouldn't have
34:59
done that I just learned something that's what humility is that's what Jesus is like
35:06
that's what blessing my enemies looks like that's what not having a fence looks
35:12
like that's what being a man or woman of no reputation looks like that's what
35:18
fearing God only and not fearing people looks like
35:24
I see the example [Applause]
35:31
that that's what that's what Ministry should look like that's how to give God glory and not
35:37
take any glory for yourself that's how to walk in authority over demons
35:42
that's how to love people that's how you love you level
35:48
how I'm seeing them operate how I'm seeing them speak how I'm seeing them speak about other people how I'm
35:54
speaking and seeing them honor other people how I'm seeing them minister to people that's love
36:00
that's how we love people
36:07
Hallelujah so this is just God's design this is how he has made it to be this is what it
36:13
would have been with Paul Paul would have been having the fruits of the spirit and it would
36:19
have been more transformed into the image of God than his disciples and so he would he would be this example
36:25
through his teaching through just his interactions how he would act
36:31
um how he would how would he would respond to his accusers and how he would Minister to people
36:37
so he's this example for people to see this is what it means to be christ-like
36:43
and so they would watch and they would know okay I gotta change my heart here I gotta be
36:48
more like this this is how I respond in this situation this is how I love people amen
36:54
Hallelujah so this is gonna be so important with you now reading the
37:01
word of God because some of you didn't realize just how loving God was
37:09
until you saw it demonstrated in an anointed minister
37:15
especially if you've had a lot of leaders above you that weren't loving or weren't humble you know
37:21
but now you have that example and now your eyes are going to open up in the word of God more and really be able to
37:26
hear God's heart and not be confused by scriptures because you're like no that's not God
37:33
God wouldn't say that God wouldn't do that that's not what God means right in scripture this isn't to be taken like
37:39
literally in this example amen
37:44
so that's number one um well number one well okay number one to hear God's voice in the word is to
37:52
come with the intention to hear his voice number two is to have make sure you have a place you're planted like
37:58
here where you have a spiritual father or mother that's truly anointed so so God's love is revealed first of all so
38:04
you getting to know more revelation of God's heart and also the teachings your the scripture I'm teaching you this is
38:11
what the scripture means so anointing is coming to you through that word and now when you read the scripture it's going
38:17
to open up in a way and it didn't ever before because of the other scriptures that your eyes have opened up through
38:24
the teaching in the church amen okay so now
38:32
now I'm going to teach something that's going to be I believe will be life-changing for you
38:38
with how you can understand the word of God there are scriptures there are several
38:46
several scriptures in the Bible that are that that are seemingly contradictory to
38:51
each other seemingly contradictory there's several
38:56
of them and so today I'm going to teach you how
39:02
to really understand them make them make sense Hallelujah
39:08
[Applause] so
39:15
um as I said before the Bible is huge you can't understand everything all at once so be patient sometimes maybe you
39:22
won't understand something sometimes you'll see to the contradict and you don't have to feel like start sweating you don't have to start googling
39:29
um don't don't don't do that don't go to YouTube and that's wrong you know
39:35
be patient some so I'm going to reveal some of them to you today but you might you might have others that you're not
39:40
sure about yet just be patient you don't need to you if you don't know yet it's because God doesn't need you to know for
39:46
sure yet amen but don't be so impatient to know that you go searching
39:53
and open up a door for the angel of Light to speak to you the wrong religious interpretation okay
40:00
number one number two when you are looking at the scripture in general
40:05
there's two things you need to be looking at I mean you need to have in your mind
40:11
you need to have in your mind what is God's heart
40:18
like remember this is the word of God not what are these religious Pharisee
40:25
people you know interpreting the scripture their heart what is God's heart
40:30
you need to think about that when you're reading the word um number two you need to look at the
40:38
context whenever you read scripture the context meaning
40:45
who is the writer speaking to because Paul speaks at different Church
40:50
groups and they had different issues going on sometimes there's a specific issue in the church that was just for that time
40:57
period having to do the specific culture at that time for example
41:02
so you need to look at the context and that takes study I mean some of that you can learn from like what I'm going to
41:08
share with you today someone can do the study work for you like an anointed teacher it can't be just anyone someone that God's called you to listen from
41:14
but this takes studying to find the context the meaning the Greek and the
41:20
Greek meanings of the scriptures and the context of that Corinthian Church for example what was happening in that time
41:26
frame in that City they you know people were worshiping goddesses and everything they had a certain culture going on that
41:33
we can literally look in history so you need to know the context the context of of who they who it is
41:41
they're speaking to
41:48
and also the context also means the scripture around that one scripture
41:54
people have to pull one scripture no you need to look around it because then you can really get the true meaning oh that's what they're talking about
42:01
you know that's very important that's what I mean by context I'm going to give you an example of
42:07
context how people can get it wrong that really mean real meaning of like the writer on the Bible or the minister
42:14
like Paul speaking to a certain group of people in a certain time for a certain reason but not to everybody in the whole
42:20
world for the future okay here's an example remember covid right
42:26
you guys remember that praise God as many years back now but um
42:31
so in covert times like uh we we were worshiping we had church at Pan Pacific
42:36
Park but in a building we were running a senior activity center it was like a gym Auditorium space we had about 10 or so
42:42
people in the church at that time in 2020 March 2020 when covet hit we were running that place renting it so when
42:48
covet hit they said you can't rent here anymore now God spoke to me he said
42:54
I'm I'm moving outside of the box take my church outside and so we went out in
42:59
the park and had Church okay but let's let's pretend that
43:05
um I owned that building okay let's pretend I owned that uh that building we
43:11
were renting so I could choose what I wanted to do whether we keep the doors open or shut right
43:18
and what if you know what something that God probably would have spoken to me well he still probably would have spoke he still would have spoken on moving
43:24
outside of the box but also look at the wisdom in this it was why it would have been wise and
43:30
it was wise for God to send us outside for a couple reasons number one it was a
43:36
it was an awesome season of evangelism where people were in the park especially because they were wanting to get out of
43:42
the house because they're stuck in the house all the time and so they would um pass by and stumble upon us and they
43:48
would end up sitting there in the amphitheater and God would end up touching them through the prophetic word through the
43:54
anointing end up crying we had some guy was sweaty going for a
43:59
run and everything just stirred off even going for a run and just sits down and God ends up touching him and he's crying
44:06
so you know God wanted to do that God wanted to reach those people in that season
44:12
um but number two look there's wisdom in this uh you know Faith levels were different and that's
44:17
okay we're on a journey we're on a journey so so in the body of Christ you have some people not afraid of any
44:23
sickness at all and so they'll they'll hug everybody get close to everybody they don't care
44:29
they'll be tight in the church together in the middle of covid beginning of covid they don't care then you have
44:36
another Faith level where they could could never go inside a church building
44:42
because if they're afraid of getting sick then you have middle Faith levels of you
44:48
know wearing masks but having faith in the mask and you know different Faith levels right
44:55
hey we are all on a faith Journey we're not all advancing the faith right away God loves us all
45:01
even a mustard seed of faith God loves you God can use you
45:07
so it would have been wise in that time this would have been the wisdom of God if I owned that building to still go
45:15
outside right so that people that were afraid could
45:20
come outside because they don't feel as afraid outside because the news was saying like you're safer outside and everything right
45:27
if more people can come Hallelujah let's go outside in the season so what if I
45:33
was writing the Bible at that time remember let's pretend it's the Bible times or covet's happening in the Bible
45:39
times and Paul's writing maybe we can say that Paul's writing put Paul in my place
45:44
when a disease comes if a disease comes you should go you should not have church outside but you should go outside
45:55
is that the word of God for every person for every year
46:00
forward no but it was a specific word for that time for those people
46:06
having to do with the wisdom of God and it wasn't even having to do with we're afraid of the disease and it's going to spread more inside no it would have been
46:13
the wisdom of God let's reach more people because people have different Faith levels and let's reach those that
46:19
are running around the park amen but that's a lot of how the Bible is is
46:25
it's it's like Paul for example speaking this prophetic word with not a huge Grand explanation like oh by the way
46:32
this isn't for you guys in the year 2023 who will read this it doesn't say that in the word of God
46:38
many times you have to you have to humble yourself really look at context
46:44
really have a heart to learn and and not just take it because you like how it sounds
46:51
it backs up your theology that's what a lot of people do so there you go that's what it is you
46:57
need to look at the context and you need to look at God's heart because if people took that it just
47:04
literal then we then people would say you're sinning if you're having Church on a building
47:10
and that's as silly as it is today with the ways that people twist scripture
47:18
all right so we're gonna get into now I'm gonna give you I'm gonna we're gonna walk through
47:24
uh seemingly contradictory scriptures right now all right
47:29
some of you are going to have some questions answered today Hallelujah
47:35
so let's get into the first one should women preach or be in places of
47:41
leadership like pastor well we look in scripture for this so let's let's look at scripture
47:48
First Corinthians 14 34 it says women should remain silent in the churches they are not allowed to speak but must
47:54
be in submission as the law says if they want to inquire about something they should ask their own husbands at home
47:59
for it is disgraceful disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church second Timothy 2 verse 12 I do not permit a
48:07
woman to teach or to assume authority over man she must be quiet
48:13
so um but then we have but then but then let's keep going let's not stop there a
48:19
lot of people like to stop there but let's keep going and look at other scriptures we find
48:25
Miriam a prophetess of the Lord a true prophetess an exodus 15 verse 20.
48:32
we find Deborah A prophetess and judge in judges 4 verse 4.
48:38
we find Anna the prophetess in the New Testament Luke 2 verse 36. we find
48:45
Priscilla the teacher in Acts chapter 18 verse 26. and Phoebe a minister one of
48:52
the five full ministers Romans 16 verse 1 and she actually delivers the great
48:57
epistle to the Romans she was sent by Paul to deliver and essentially speak and teach the epistle to the Romans then
49:05
we have halda a prophetess a prophet in second Chronicles 34 verse 21. in this
49:13
time there was a word of God there was the word of God discovered and there was a king at that time that wanted to make
49:20
sure this was really the word of God the written word of God so he says go
49:25
and inquire of the Lord for me and for the remnant in Israel and Judah about what is written in this book that has
49:30
been found and then we're going to go on a little bit further and it says hilakia and
49:36
who's those the king had sent with him went to speak to the prophet holda so the king says go and find me a true
49:44
servant of God a prophet of God that can verify that this is the word of God that
49:49
we have discovered here and at the time there were at this time
49:56
Prophet Jeremiah and Prophet Zephaniah were around
50:01
they could have been called to do this job to verify for the king to essentially teach the king but
50:08
prophetess halda was the one chosen so she verifies that this is the word of
50:15
God and so she's actually teaching the king so a woman prophetess actually
50:21
teaches the king the word of God
50:27
and not only that but she then prophesies to the King this is King Josiah
50:34
you can read all I'm just summarizing for you I know many you don't know the scripture you should go read it second chronicles 34.
50:41
Second Chronicles 34 read that chapter so you can this is me summarizing so you can really read it all but um she ends
50:48
up prophesying and she says there's going to be destruction that comes to the land but Josiah because of your heart God is going to make you die in
50:56
peace and the disaster will not come at your time so this woman of God was the one chosen
51:02
by the king to teach the king and she prophesies to the king and the
51:07
prophecies came to pass then we have
51:13
um the woman at the well the Samaritan woman at the well she goes and tells
51:19
everyone that the Messiah is here so she is the first evangelist
51:26
Hallelujah God allowed her to go Jesus allowed her
51:31
to go do that Jesus you know could have not had this whole encounter happen but
51:36
he had this whole encounter happen because he wanted her to go spread the word
51:42
evangelize teach and speak the Messiah is here
51:49
when Jesus was resurrected it was a woman Mary Magdalene who was
51:54
the first to see him now God is God and he obviously orchestrated that it wasn't like that
52:00
was an accident amen so he chose to appear to a woman not
52:06
only that but Jesus actually instructs her
52:12
go to my brothers and tell them John 2017 go to my brothers and tell them I
52:18
am ascending to my father and your father to my God and your God so he instructs Mary Magdalene go and teach
52:26
evangelize preach the gospel that I have risen from the grave
52:34
and I am ascending to the father so he wanted her to do that amen
52:42
Hallelujah all right so then we also see Acts 2
52:48
verse 17. it says that Sons and Daughters will prophesy
52:55
that's New Testament It also says Galatians 3 28 that there is no male or
53:01
female you were all one in Christ
53:09
and Hallelujah and so the the revelation of that is
53:15
that it is the Holy Spirit who does everything through us we are just
53:20
vessels we are just vessels we do not do 20 of
53:26
the work we are vessels who the holy spirit moves through us Holy Spirit can move through a donkey
53:33
right is Holy Spirit doing everything we are just vessels we don't mix like
53:40
together with God do you know what I mean like it's like um like like this where the vessel he's the water
53:47
that's why I say it's God's power doing everything it's not me and God together making demons to go no
53:55
I speak and do what he tells me to do but I'm just a vessel it is 100 the
54:00
power of God that does every miracle it's not like me who has power because I
54:05
become one with God yes I'm one with God but God has all the power God does every
54:11
Miracle I'm just a vessel I don't have special human powers that
54:17
God and I mix together now I'm this Superwoman person no I'm a vessel
54:23
for God to do everything through so God is not limited by a woman or a man he
54:29
can do whatever he wants through either amen so
54:36
when the Holy Spirit comes inside a person and the holy spirit moves to the person Holy Spirit doesn't turn into a
54:43
woman womanly Holy Spirit same for a man Holy Spirit comes a
54:50
person he's not like masculine manly Holy Spirit he's just God
54:57
he's just God [Applause]
55:02
so that's why it's saying there's we're one in this one in Christ there's no
55:07
male or female there there's God can do anything he wants the same exact thing amen
55:14
so we have two scriptures that say that women should not speak or
55:20
preach or or be be in leadership position basically and we have I don't know how many
55:28
that say that women should preach should lead many more
55:34
isn't that just let's just stop there isn't that wild the doctrine that's been more prevalent
55:40
the wrong doctrine that when you think about it I'm just having this Revelation right now that's crazy goodness
55:48
right there's so many more that show so this is what so this is what you need to
55:54
do when you when you look at these scriptures and you're like okay this is weird they like contradict each other it
55:59
seems like you need to first um look at God's heart have that open heart
56:06
well it really looks like God wants to use women according to all these other scriptures and according to the God that I know his heart
56:14
that's why I'm saying when you read scripture ask yourself what is God's heart
56:21
also ask yourself this is would God make up these random rules that don't really make sense
56:27
and that's what people don't realize is what you're believing when you believe these scriptures that contradict God's
56:33
character God's not out there to make up it does
56:38
not make sense for God to prohibit half of his children from taking down the
56:43
devil and being vessels of him and making the kingdom of God to go forth it doesn't make sense
56:50
and also like use common sense it's not like it's scientifically
56:57
um proven that women are not as smart as men or something is
57:02
it's not it's not like it's scientifically proven that women cannot lead and be in places of leadership and
57:09
Authority society makes it seem that way but that's what Society has done but when
57:15
God gets in the picture God can break all of the Demonic walls of the society
57:20
has brought you know and give the ability to women to be able
57:26
to lead and walk in authority just as he wants them to you know like use common
57:32
sense it does not make sense at all why God would not want women to teach to be
57:40
in places of leadership right amen okay so that so that will
57:46
help you so much without you even needing to know the context so you already probably can come to the right
57:51
conclusion and hear God's true voice with just what I've shared with you amen and maybe you're like I don't understand
57:56
why the scriptures say that but all I know is God's heart so I don't have to know everything understand everything
58:02
but this is my conclusion from the holy spirit that God does want woman to preach and lead and teach amen
58:10
so now we're going to enter in context okay so remember that example I shared with you about
58:16
um kovid how you should leave out the the the church building and go to the
58:22
park it's just it's the same thing and it's what was happening in the times
58:27
uh when when in the Corinthian Church for example when Paul was speaking to this is there was a lot of um sin going
58:34
on in that culture and the woman it was like a sinly uh culture that woman women
58:41
were acting in sin women were acting rebellious and so in the church it was Translating that culture was translating
58:47
into the church and women were getting overly zealous and not in a good way to
58:53
have spiritual gifts and to be leaders in some way and when you look
59:01
at uh when you look at what when Paul is
59:06
saying um woman should remain silent in the churches if you we need to look at the context
59:12
before it so he's actually talking about order in the church if you look before
59:17
it he's speaking this is how prophecy should go forth it shouldn't be everybody prophesying at one time this
59:23
is how speaking in tongues should be like uh if speaking in tongues is a message for the church not just speaking
59:29
in tongues like we're worshiping God together and speaking in our Heavenly language but when we're um when a person
59:36
is called to speak a actual message from God to the church in a tongue it should be interpreted so the people know what the message is and so he's speaking on
59:43
this order he's saying how there should not be disorder in the church and so now he's addressing woman and woman at that
59:48
time were being disorderly because of the culture that was going on in that days that was influencing them also
59:54
women were not educated very well at that time they had a lot of questions more
59:59
questions than the men would because of the culture in that time also um in the Jewish culture that still
1:00:06
would have been they still would have wouldn't have been completely out of it probably yeah you know it was a gradual thing but and the Jewish culture men
1:00:13
would sit on one side woman would sit on the other side when women had their periods they were unclean in the Jewish Customs now they were free from that now
1:00:20
they didn't believe that anymore but they were still sitting on opposite sides so women had these questions they
1:00:26
were uneducated at the same time they were being rebellious and influenced by
1:00:31
the culture and they were speaking out loud questions to their husbands across the aisle
1:00:37
and it literally says ask your husbands at home it was dealing with the woman in the congregation it wasn't addressing
1:00:42
women in leadership amen so that is the context of that
1:00:50
scripture it was Paul speaking to the people at that time because of what was
1:00:57
going on at that time it was not meant to be for all women forever
1:01:04
amen also Hallelujah also we know that women should be in
1:01:13
leadership that God wants them to be faithful ministers because the list that I just went through where I listed prophet prophetesses in Old and New
1:01:21
Testament because of teachers that we see in the New Testament because of even Apostles a woman it speaks of in the New
1:01:28
Testament because of the woman at the well and I mean and and the Mary
1:01:33
Magdalene I mean that was a place of leadership the Mary Magdalene was telling all of the men I saw Jesus that
1:01:41
was a leadership like position amen at that point at that time to deliver that
1:01:47
important of a message amen Hallelujah so when you understand the
1:01:53
context now you know the context in the heart of God now you understand really God's voice when it's speaking about
1:02:00
women preaching in the church leading in the church amen Hallelujah
1:02:09
um now we are going to go on to uh this next
1:02:14
um this this next these next scriptures that seemingly contradict and that's
1:02:20
about spiritual fathers so Matthew 23 verse 9 it says Jesus says
1:02:28
do not call anyone on Earth father for you have one father and he is in Heaven nor are you to be called instructors for
1:02:34
you have one instructor the Messiah then we see First Corinthians 4 verse
1:02:40
15. uh Paul say in the New Testament even if you had ten thousand teach
1:02:46
others to teach you about Christ you have only one spiritual Father for I became your father in Christ Jesus when
1:02:53
I preach the good news to you so we see a lot of people using the scripture I spoke before saying you
1:02:59
should not have any spiritual fathers or mothers because this scripture says Jesus says you should not call anybody father
1:03:05
okay so these seemingly contradict so let's look at God's heart first god
1:03:11
let's go to God's heart God's heart we see Elijah to Elisha Moses to Joshua
1:03:18
Paul to Timothy we see God's system and principle and his heart for
1:03:25
people to come under an anointed leader as a spiritual son as a spiritual
1:03:30
daughter and then be not just a mentor but a father or mother in the spirit one
1:03:37
that that gives a covering a spiritual covering of protection and and one that
1:03:44
will release impartation mantle like Elijah to Elisha right so that's God's heart and we we
1:03:51
know that God trusts Paul to write most of the New Testament and Paul is saying here um I'm your spiritual father right so
1:03:58
okay we have God's heart now let's look at context so the scripture the first scripture in
1:04:04
Matthew 23 verse 9 we're going to go we have to look at the surrounding scripture to really understand what's
1:04:10
going on so we're going to go back to verse one and it says Jesus said to the crowds and to his
1:04:15
disciples the teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses's seat so you
1:04:20
must be careful to do everything they tell you but do not do what they do for they do not practice what they preach
1:04:26
they tie up heavy cumbersome loads and put them on other people's shoulders but they themselves are not willing to lift
1:04:33
a finger to move them everything they do is done for people to see they make their
1:04:39
phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garment long they love the place of honor at Banquets and the most
1:04:44
important seats in the synagogues they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called Rabbi by
1:04:50
others but you are not to be called Rabbi for you have one teacher and you're all brothers and do not call
1:04:56
anyone on Earth father for you have one father and he is in Heaven nor are you to be called instructors for you have
1:05:02
one instructor of the Messiah the greatest among you will be your servant so we see that he that Jesus is angry at
1:05:09
the Pharisees at how they are absolutely not uh true
1:05:16
fathers spiritual fathers and teachers and they have these horrible motives
1:05:21
that they want to Lord over people and have this gross pride and Jesus is not
1:05:27
happy with that at all he's mad at that he's talking to his disciples at this time when they are still with him on
1:05:33
this Earth he's talking to them as babies who are just still learning and he's speaking to them in this certain
1:05:39
moment don't call them teacher don't call them Father
1:05:49
that's what he's saying in this moment and and part of what I'm saying to you is is is is the holy spirit giving me
1:05:55
Revelation to teach you sometimes that's what's needed sometimes it's it's more than just looking at the
1:06:00
scriptural context but getting that Revelation from the Holy Spirit so that's what I'm sharing with you the
1:06:06
Holy Spirit spoke to me that this that he was speaking to them at that time about the Pharisees specifically not
1:06:14
that as time progressed and it was time for them to be spiritual fathers and mothers that they shouldn't call
1:06:19
themselves fathers and so we also see how it says in
1:06:26
Ephesians 4 that God gave Apostles Jesus gave Apostles prophets evangelist pastors and teachers
1:06:32
if we took that scripture literal it would mean that we could not that you would send your child to school and you
1:06:39
could not the the child could not call their teacher teacher if you really want to take it literally
1:06:46
right Hallelujah and so that's the context of that that's the
1:06:53
context of that that God was Jesus was not speaking outside of that situation
1:06:58
concerning the Pharisees he was speaking about the Pharisees don't call them teachers and also they were just young
1:07:04
in the faith the disciples so he wasn't ready to be like you're going to be a father
1:07:10
he he was speaking like let's I want to make sure you don't have pride let's start slowly
1:07:17
you're not even ready to be thinking about being a father or a teacher yet so I'm not going to say but the time will
1:07:23
come when it will be okay for you to be a spiritual father he wasn't to that point yet
1:07:29
amen Hallelujah all right now we are going to go on to
1:07:36
these next scriptures that are saving the contradictory that are uh our
1:07:41
apostles around today
1:07:46
acts 1 21 therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with
1:07:52
us the whole time the Lord Jesus was living among us beginning from John's baptism to the time when Jesus was taken
1:07:57
up from us for one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection so
1:08:03
this was when Judas committed suicide and they needed another one Apostle to replace him okay
1:08:10
so they're saying that it should be someone who was living among us who witnessed Jesus in person
1:08:17
then we see First Corinthians 9 1 Paul says am I not an apostle have I not seen
1:08:23
Jesus our lord um and so a lot of people have the
1:08:28
doctrine that Apostles are not around today because an apostle must have seen
1:08:33
Jesus in person they say this because of these scriptures
1:08:39
well let's go on and find more scriptures about Apostles Ephesians 4 11.
1:08:46
we read this earlier that these are the gifts that Christ gave to the church Apostles and these gifts were given
1:08:52
after Jesus ascended okay after he ascended he then gave gifts so this is
1:08:58
this is after the time of him commissioning the 12 disciples this is he has crucified resurrected pouredeth
1:09:05
Holy Spirit to the church and he gave gifts to the church Apostles are one of them one of the five
1:09:12
it then says verse 13 this will continue
1:09:18
until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God's son that we will be mature in the Lord measuring up
1:09:24
to the full and complete standard of Christ passion translation says these Grace
1:09:29
Ministries will function until we all attain Oneness into the faith until we
1:09:35
all experience the fullness of what it means to know the Son of God and so we and finally become one into a perfect
1:09:41
man with full dimensions of spiritual maturity fully developed into the abundance of Christ
1:09:46
so in other words this equipping of the fifo Ministries including the apostles will continue
1:09:53
until the bride has been perfectly prepared and Jesus has returned
1:10:01
Hallelujah so then we we also see Romans 16 7. this
1:10:07
is a passion translation um Paul's saying makes uh make sure that my relatives are dronachists and Junior
1:10:14
that's a woman are honored for their my fellow captives who bear the distinctive
1:10:19
Mark of being outstanding and well-known apostles
1:10:25
so adronicus and Junior which is a woman are well-known Apostles there we have
1:10:30
another example of a woman in leadership amen but um okay so these people adronicus
1:10:38
and Junior they were after the time of Jesus being there on the Earth
1:10:43
so we see there's Apostles after who had not witnessed Jesus in person
1:10:49
first Thessalonians 2 6 we which is Paul Timothy and Silas it says in the Bible
1:10:55
and one of the translations it says Paul Timothy and Silas we were not looking for praise from people not from you or
1:11:02
anyone else even though as Apostles of Christ we could have asserted our Authority so Timothy and Silas were also
1:11:08
not the original 12 ones that had seen Jesus in person the Next Generation so there was a next
1:11:15
generation of Apostles being raised up under Paul's Ministry under the other
1:11:21
Apostles Ministries okay so here we have these contradicting uh scriptures so well for one we already
1:11:28
find that there's way more scriptures that show that God wants apostles
1:11:33
to be around till Jesus returns right we see that there's way more
1:11:39
um we know what's God's heart well it doesn't really make sense why God would want to get rid of Apostles when he says
1:11:45
that this is in the foundation of the church with Christ Jesus as the Chief Cornerstone Ephesians 2 20.
1:11:52
and this important equipping is necessary all five of these Ministries are necessary for the body of Christ to
1:11:58
be fully equipped so okay that's God's heart um and now we're going to look at
1:12:04
context so these first couple scriptures that say that there's the disciples are
1:12:10
saying um we need to find someone to replace Judas one of these must come become a witness
1:12:16
with us of his resurrection so this was just the wisdom they were using at that time might as well choose someone who
1:12:24
actually witnessed Jesus they'll probably be stronger in faith than those who didn't actually witness Jesus this
1:12:29
is brand new gospel here it's more likely that people who are
1:12:35
really with the apostles in the beginning saw Jesus that they'll be stronger in faith
1:12:41
just at that time amen just at that time it was just in that season and that makes sense right that makes sense
1:12:50
um but it was just meant for that time and and Paul says I saw Jesus but when he saw Jesus it was actually Jesus
1:12:56
rebuking him it wasn't you're so amazing
1:13:02
and I am anointing you today as my apostle look at me and gaze upon my beauty
1:13:10
you know what I mean it wasn't like I mean when when Paul uh saw Jesus it was
1:13:16
Jesus rebuking him for persecuting him through the disciples murdering his
1:13:21
disciples so he shut his eyes it wasn't like he really even got to see much he shut his eyes
1:13:28
and then he said go to my servant and he'll tell you what to do so this a servant opened up his eyes
1:13:34
a minister an apostle opened up his eyes God used an apostle to open up his eyes
1:13:40
and then he began ministering shortly after that so a lot of people have this doctrine that they think that Apostles
1:13:46
are being prideful or something like you didn't see Jesus you know people but Paul's saying I saw Jesus but the
1:13:54
real meaning is I saw spiritually
1:13:59
like our eyes to see where it's based on faith God our belief and our faith is
1:14:05
it's not based on sight amen it's based on spiritual sight that's
1:14:10
faith so um Apostles must be called by Jesus
1:14:16
and they see Jesus in the spiritual realm and God calls them sometimes that can come through a prophet prophesying
1:14:22
but they've seen Jesus through that encounter Hallelujah
1:14:27
Hallelujah so then we can hear God's voice and conclude that Apostles God is using them
1:14:36
today and will continue to use them and that the requirements are that they are
1:14:42
truly called by Jesus and have seen him in the spiritual realm the requirement isn't having to see him physically that
1:14:49
may happen sometimes but that's not a requirement amen Hallelujah
1:14:55
[Applause] hallelujah praise God so those are a few
1:15:02
examples for you to help you there's more there's more seemingly
1:15:08
contradictory ones there's more but now you know how to hear God's voice in the word because of his teaching
1:15:15
today amen and and so like I said don't feel like
1:15:23
you must know immediately you know don't be aware of these people that are trying
1:15:28
to shove scripture down your throat I know that people there's I know that there's literally people on a mission
1:15:35
to message uh hosts of my events to message you
1:15:40
people here and shove script these scriptures down your throat
1:15:45
to try to convince you that there's no apostles today that women cannot be in leadership or
1:15:51
teach and give you a whole great explanation of why they why this is true I know
1:15:58
that's a mission of a lot of people coming from the devil because the devil is angry about this revival but he is
1:16:06
defeated amen my the P you shall know the truth
1:16:12
and the truth shall set you free so you know the truth of scripture so
1:16:17
you do not have to be deceived by people coming with wrong religious Revelation
1:16:23
and this also includes other remember I told you about how God's not limited to
1:16:28
the Bible he brings fresh Revelations that must correspond with scripture but it's not
1:16:35
like it's verbatim scripture it's built upon it it it it it aligns with
1:16:41
so so this is part of the new wine and people love to attack that too where is that in the Bible so just be aware
1:16:49
of these schemes of the devil to come in this way shoving this scripture to you
1:16:56
the important thing for you to understand is even if you don't understand right away that's okay don't let fear enter you
1:17:02
God will reveal all that you need to know give you the understanding in his timing as you humble yourself amen
1:17:10
Hallelujah Hallelujah thank you Jesus
1:17:16
praise God I want to speak over you all right now
1:17:21
I want to declare over all of you right now that all of the religious lies and
1:17:28
religious Doctrine that's come at you that's confused you that's brought you fear and confusion and a lack of passion
1:17:38
for God may this be removed from you now in Jesus name
1:17:44
all of that religiousness out now in Jesus name and I release this anointing upon you
1:17:50
all and I declare that your eyes would be opened your eyes would be illuminated that as you read the word of God you
1:17:58
would understand it more than ever before in your life that you would hear God's voice speak to you that you would
1:18:04
receive only the true real revelation in Jesus name that you would grow in
1:18:09
understanding you would grow in the knowledge of God in Jesus name
1:18:14
amen Hallelujah Hallelujah
1:18:20
praise God [Applause]
