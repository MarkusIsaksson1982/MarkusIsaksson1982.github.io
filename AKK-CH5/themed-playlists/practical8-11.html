Abram was called to leave his land when
0:03
God was giving him a new name and
0:05
placing him in the land where he would
0:07
fulfill his purpose that's the same for
0:09
us today you can't bring people from
0:12
Abram land that are stuck in old wine
0:15
that can't receive the new wine with you
0:18
if you want to go where God has called
0:19
you to it won't work it'll be pulling
0:22
you back there will be people that don't
0:26
get it that are like how the Pharisees
0:28
were like they were stuck in the old
0:30
wine they just won't get it their eyes
0:32
just won't open up or at least in this
0:33
season they will not open up and that's
0:36
just how it is and we just have to
0:38
accept that and we have to realize that
0:41
it's not doing us any good to bring
0:43
Abram land with us we can't God called
0:46
Abram to leave the old land and leave
0:48
the old people behind they were there
0:50
for a season they were good in a season
0:53
but they can't help you get to where God
0:54
has called you to go they will pull you
0:56
back God doesn't want you to be held
0:58
back he doesn't want you to be halfway
1:01
in halfway out halfway in the new wine
1:03
but holding on to Abram land at the same
1:05
time pulling the friends with the old
1:07
wine skin that won't leave their old
1:08
wines skin pulling them along with you
1:10
you won't be the most powerful vessel of
1:12
God you can be we still love everyone
1:14
from our past but new boundaries need to
1:17
be made in different seasons according
1:19
to how God's leading you and it's making
1:21
room for the right people to come
1:23
alongside you God can't entrust you with
1:25
the right good people in the Abraham
1:27
land if you're still hanging on to Abram
1:31
land people he can't entrust because
1:34
then you're going to hold them back you
1:36
know people that are fully surrendered
1:37
in Abraham land people that are fully
1:40
surrendered in the new wine he can't
1:43
entrust them to you to be a friend to
1:46
you if you aren't all in because you
1:48
will pull them back so it's missing out
1:52
on what God has for you on fulfilling
1:54
your purpose if you hang on to Abram
1:57
land
