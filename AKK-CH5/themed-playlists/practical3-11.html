0:00
when God is calling you to say no that's
0:03
100% obedience to God and it's not being
0:07
unloving that's you loving God so no has
0:11
to be a part of your vocabulary there's
0:13
no way you can be a True Believer and
0:15
please God and please people right the
0:17
Bible says we cannot be pleasing God and
0:19
be pleasing people so what does that
0:21
mean no has to be part of our vocabulary
0:24
so get used to it we got to grow up we
0:26
got to be strong and do what God is
0:29
calling us do do uncomfortable things
0:31
yes it's going to be uncomfortable to
0:33
say no sometimes especially when people
0:35
are trying to manipulate you you just
0:37
have to be confident in what God has
0:39
called you to do and be strong and know
0:42
that God is with you helping you put
0:44
boundaries up helping you keep the door
0:47
shut to the devil helping you to say no
0:50
and stand firm it doesn't matter what
0:53
your personality is you can be
0:57
courageous and strong through Christ it
1:00
doesn't matter if your whole life you
1:01
were taken advantage of you were a
1:03
pushover you were shy it does not matter
1:06
you can do what God is calling you to do
