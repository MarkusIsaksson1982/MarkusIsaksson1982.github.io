Luke 3:16 John answered their questions by saying I baptize you with water but
0:06
someone is coming soon who is greater than I am so much greater that I'm not even worthy to be his slave and untie
0:12
the straps of his sandals he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and
0:17
with fire acts 1 verse4 once when he was
0:25
eating with them he commanded them this is Jesus do not leave Jerusalem until the father sends you the gift he
0:32
promised as I told you before John baptized with water but in just a few
0:37
days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit Luke 24:49 and now I will send
0:45
the Holy Spirit just as my father promised but stay here in the city until
0:51
the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power from
0:58
heaven so so here are these scriptures speaking
1:03
about the fire the fire of the Holy Spirit and we we as we see in Luke 3:16
1:11
the first verse I read he will um je John is is is uh saying I'm baptized you
1:18
with water but Jesus is coming Jesus is going to come and baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with
1:25
fire and so when you give your life to Jesus you receive the the Holy Spirit
1:30
the Holy Spirit enters your life and you have now direct connection to God don't
1:39
need any kind of middleman you can have intimacy and relationship with God by
1:44
the Holy Spirit living in you you become one with the Holy Spirit and the Holy
1:49
Spirit is your helper is your comforter and will help guide you and Lead You In
1:55
His will amen then there's also the baptism of the Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit
2:02
comes in Fire and it this is usually a secondary
2:12
infilling of the Holy Spirit acts 10:44 it says while Peter was still speaking
2:18
these words so he's preaching so as he's preaching it says the Holy Spirit came on all who heard
2:26
the message the circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had
2:31
been poured out even on Gentiles for they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God acts 8:14 when the apostles
2:39
in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God they sent Peter and John to Samaria when they arrived
2:44
they prayed for the new Believers there that they might receive the holy spirit because the Holy Spirit had not yet come
2:50
on any of them they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord
2:56
Jesus then Peter and John placed their hands on them and they received the holy
3:01
spirit so this when they're talking about they had not received the holy spirit yet they're talking about they
3:07
had not received the Holy Spirit in fire the baptism of the holy spirit because
3:13
according to the scripture we see that these people had believed that Jesus is
3:18
Lord because they were being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus they were choosing they were not forced they were
3:25
choosing to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus this is in the book of Acts
3:30
so this is our example of church today so but these people they had not
3:35
received the baptism of the Holy Spirit coming in fire yet so that's why I say usually it's a
3:43
second infilling the baptism of the Holy Spirit which is also the Holy Spirit coming in
3:50
fire an infilling of fire of the Holy Spirit I was a Believer my whole life I
3:57
aged four I remember um just inviting Jesus into my heart into my life and I
4:04
never looked back I never doubted I went through a lukewarm phase in high school
4:10
but I never stopped doubting that Jesus was Lord was my
4:16
Lord um and I always loved him so he was always my Lord I had the Holy Spirit but
4:23
it wasn't until my mid 20s that I was baptized in the Holy Spirit
4:30
and when I came to a point where I really wanted to surrender my whole life
4:37
for the first time every single part my dreams my plan my will and when my faith
4:43
was ripe after seeking God like never before and finding him that's when the Holy
4:51
Spirit in fire the baptism of the Holy Spirit came upon my life and when that
4:58
did I started a immediately speaking in tongues and and upon that encounter I
5:07
was so moved to really surrender everything I was ready to surrender
5:12
everything but then when my eyes opened up to God like never before by experiencing his
5:19
fire I was moved to surrender every last
5:24
bit and this and this was God's amazing
5:29
preparation amazing timing because nine months eight8 to nine months later is when I met my now spiritual father and
5:37
he prophesied to me my calling to be an apostle so God prepared me to be able to
5:43
receive that calling and say Yes Lord I'm ready quickly because I had
5:49
surrendered everything because I had the fire and I was now prepared prepared for
5:54
Ministry prepared I had the power now the power of the Holy Spirit not to be
6:00
confused with the anointing because the anointing is what destroys the Yoke and it's for Ministry
6:07
the baptism of the holy spirit is is is this is the precursor before receiving
6:13
the anointing it's what prepares you to receive the anointing It prepares you to
6:19
do the works of God prepares you for Ministry the baptism of the Holy Spirit
6:24
does three three things the fire of the Holy Spirit one is it consumes the
6:30
carnal desires and tendencies the fire consumes the carnal
6:38
desires and tendencies consuming
6:44
fire and I remember this before I would struggle with a little lukewarm
6:50
Tendencies and I didn't know why uh desires of the Flesh and I didn't
6:56
want them I understood it was not right to have them there but I didn't know why there wasn't change when the fire came
7:01
they disappeared they literally disappeared they were consumed literally
7:07
from that day any kind of Desire I had of the world it disappeared from that
7:12
day literally literally it was consumed
7:18
Hallelujah and the baptism of the Holy Spirit the holy the fire of the Holy Spirit also purifies the fire is
7:26
purifying it purifies you transforms DET in you to be
7:32
Christlike as you seek God the fire is a powerful force that comes upon you and
7:37
helps you to be more Christlike so the fire empowers you to
7:46
be Christlike because it's a choice to be Christlike it doesn't happen automatically it doesn't happen by just
7:52
Lord change me automatically comes you have to make the choice and intention to
7:57
be patient to be selfless to love others to to be servant-hearted to be
8:05
humble you have to make that intention amen so it purifies you transforms you
8:13
and then thirdly the fire the fire of the Holy Spirit ignites passion for God
8:19
and for his kingdom it ignites it ignites
8:27
passion ignites cuz that's what fire does it it's this powerful
8:32
force it ignites this passion for God you might have loved God before but now
8:37
you're burning for him because fire came to help you be ignited to ignite
8:45
you um and it and and with this because whenever you love somebody you you you
8:53
pay attention to their heart you want their heart's desires you you want them to be pleased you want them to be happy
9:00
you want them to be blessed so it's like you come in alignment with their heart when you really love somebody so now
9:07
when you're burning for God you're also Burning For What God Burns for you're passionate suddenly for what
9:14
he's passionate for amen so the baptis of the holy
9:20
spirit this is a gift that does these things it does these things and I saw that happen in my life I saw all those
9:26
things happen in my life I saw not only did the fire consume the carnal desires
9:31
but all of a sudden I became more Christlike like quickly quickly I became
9:36
more Christlike because of the fire purifying I I I I saw this Burning
9:43
passion for God I never had before and I had and I had this passion
9:48
for for his kingdom like I never had before for his people hallelujah so this
9:55
is why the scriptures that we just read we're seeing sometimes that the dis IES were saying okay they were baptized in
10:01
the name of the Lord Jesus they believe that Jesus is Lord they have the Holy Spirit but they need the infilling of
10:07
the fire they need another infilling of fire the baptism of the holy
10:16
spirit so this is what the baptis of the Holy Spirit does So It prepares you to
10:21
be a vessel ready for God to pour the third indwelling the anointing the third indwelling of the
10:27
Holy Spirit the anointing so the baptism of the holy spirit is for your spiritual
10:35
life consuming purifying igniting it's for your spiritual
10:42
life It prepares you to be the vessel that God can entrust with the anointing
10:48
the anointing is not for your spiritual life it's for others when God gives you the anointing it's purely to release to
10:56
others Hallelujah praise God
11:01
so the fire of the Holy Spirit baptism of the holy spirit is what God wants for
11:07
every believer for every single for every single one of you this is what God wants
11:14
for you it's a gift he has for you the disciples were saying they did not have
11:19
the baptism holy spirit yet they saw they needed the holy spirit so they laid hands and we see in these two different
11:26
scriptures that I read the last two scriptures I read was we see one time Peter is speaking and the Holy Spirit
11:32
falls on people and they start speaking in tongues and then we see also another time they lay hands and they start
11:40
speaking in tongues they receive the fire so so so so just like um how
11:45
healing Works where healing can happen through laying on of hands or just being
11:51
under the shadow of the anointing and the power of God touching you without a vessel laying hands it's the same way to
11:59
receive the baptism of the holy spirit so sometimes it happens through
12:05
laying on of hands sometimes that happens just by usually usually it happens by being where the power of God
12:12
is and the fire of the holy spirit's released and you receive it where you
12:19
are amen there are some people that have received the baptism of the Holy Spirit
12:24
without a vessel but God's main way of releasing the of the holy spirit is
12:31
through vessels just like we see the examples in the Bible through Peter through the disciples
12:37
amen hallelujah so this is what this fire is
12:42
that we're speaking about it's an inner fire if you have not received the baptism of the holy spirit yet today is
12:50
your day to receive it Hallelujah
12:57
yes and um you know when these examples that I just
13:02
read in the Bible where we see people receiving the baptism of the holy spirit it's saying they're all receiving it
13:08
it's not saying just a few people I remember I never I remember when I was
13:13
in college I went to a church and at this time I did not know that um God was
13:20
using vessels and power at this time when I was in college I did not know that demons existed and that God was
13:27
using vessels to cast out demons today I did not know that and and and healing
13:32
people I did not know that so I did not know about tongues I think I i' read it in the
13:38
Bible before but I did not know that the gift of tongues was for believers today I remember I went to a little small Church in college and I start hearing a
13:45
couple people speaking in tongues and all that I thought was they must be chosen
13:56
ones I was so enamored
14:01
wow like it did not come into my mind even 1% oh that's a gift that they have
14:08
that God wants for you too not even 1% did that come in my mind and it wasn't
14:15
until like sixish something years five to six years later that God opened my
14:24
eyes up to this truth that this gift is for every believer and God wants it for every believer just as we see it in the
14:29
book of Acts and that's when I received it amen hallelujah so this is a gift God
14:38
wants to give you if you have not received it he absolutely 100% wants this for you and you need it you need
14:45
this fire the main one of the main reasons why Believers today are lukewarm
14:51
is because they do not have the fire of the holy spirit because it is that that
14:57
that uh consumes the desire desires of the flesh it is that that purifies you
15:03
helping you to be Christlike it is the fire that ignites the passion for God you can't conjure up fire on your own
15:11
people are trying they're praying they're fasting they're they're they're attending all the church functions they're doing everything they can
15:17
without the fire and they're not getting anywhere I was the same way I used to do that I used to serve in a church um it
15:23
was like it was a big church so they had five to six Services every Sunday and I would be there from from 6:00 a.m. until
15:31
uh 900 p.m. with just like a half hour break serving the whole time I mean I I
15:37
was so serious about God but I didn't have the fire and I wasn't transforming
15:42
and I still was lukewarm in areas and had these desires of the flesh I couldn't get rid of why because I needed
15:50
the fire we all need the fire of the Holy
15:55
Spirit hallelujah hallelujah and also I just want to I want to also
16:01
share that you can receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit and not suddenly speak in tongues but you may still have
16:09
received it it's like a gift that needs to be activated so I know that there's some of
16:14
you that you think you've never received it because you didn't burst out in tongues but you have received it how the
16:21
gift is activated is by you seeking God the more you seek God it will suddenly
16:29
be activated amen and many of you will receive this and will be activated this
16:35
gift will be activated unlocked today hallelujah
16:43
hallelujah as you pray in tongues you're speaking directly to the Holy Spirit and
16:48
you're praying God's will you you don't need to know what
16:54
you're saying you're you're speaking God's will you're you're submitting to God God's will it's a an important way to pray
17:02
because sometimes sometimes we may not be praying according to God's will we
17:08
need to be praying according to God's will this is one of the ways that helps us pray according to God's will amen
17:15
when you also pray in tongues it helps uh uh I mean it it it fans the into
17:21
flame and now that's what I'm going to begin to be teaching right now that um
17:27
the importance of Fanning to Flame this gift of the fire of the Holy Spirit it
17:33
says in 2 Timothy 1:6 uh Paul Paul's speaking this that is why I remind you
17:40
to Fan into Flame the gracious gift of God that inner fire this is the
17:47
Amplified version so the gracious the fan into Flame the gracious gift of God that inner fire the special endowment
17:56
which is in you through the laying on of my
18:02
hands so in this circumstance he's speaking to a group of people that it
18:07
happened they received the gift through the L on of hands but that doesn't mean for everybody it's just in this circumstance it could have been you know
18:14
he this this can be spoken to you fan into flame this gift that you have received by just you being where the
18:20
power of God is and you receive this gift amen so Paul is saying this you need to
18:27
Fan into flame this gift have you ever sat around a
18:33
campfire anybody not sat around a campfire before anybody
18:38
not you never have okay so this is going to be some well maybe you already know
18:44
this but the rest have firsthand experience probably most of you have firsthand experience by the way we got
18:50
to get you at a [Laughter]
18:57
campfire I'm from a Tiny Town in the country and so I love I love the
19:04
campfires um anyways um when you most of you know this when
19:09
you're sitting around a campfire whether it was you or somebody else that Fire's
19:15
got to be kept going you know it's looking beautiful
19:20
it's looking big it's really going really blazing but I don't know 10 15 20
19:26
minutes or something like that um if you're just sitting there it will die down if it's not fanned into flame if
19:33
it's not kindled it 100% will so um if if you want to have a
19:40
campfire if you want to enjoy that fire you want to keep that fire going for a couple hours and enjoy it you have to
19:47
continually Kindle it not just one time but you have to regularly Stoke it you
19:53
take a stick and move the logs around so it hits I don't I don't know too much
19:59
about fire but I think it is like hidden a part of the branch that didn't get consumed yet so it it it's just making
20:07
it spread more basically sometimes people put like paper things that may ignite it or catch on fire quickly this
20:14
is what you do to keep the fire going okay so that's what that's what
20:21
fire is and now the Bible's talking about an inner fire and just like we talk about
20:27
kingdoms on in the kingdom of God it's really talking about Kingdom we look at kingdoms on Earth to help us understand
20:33
the kingdom of God when we talk about Authority it's it's really we we
20:39
understand Authority on this Earth how Authority works you know it's not about a physical
20:45
effort but it's about you have to be in that position and you speak a command and that thing must take
20:52
place that's how Authority works and so we have to to use that princip principle
20:58
of authority I mean that understanding of authority in the Kingdom to really be properly walking in our Authority in
21:05
Christ if we go go away from that and do things in our own way something that's
21:11
not Authority where we're not knowing who we are and commanding the demon to go simply but instead we're trying to do
21:20
all these extra things do gimmics um push people um put all these
21:28
hands scream at the top of our lungs try all these methods but none of those things
21:33
are in line with the principle of what Authority is you know it doesn't work so
21:39
so much of you know the the things about the word of God the principles in the word of
21:45
God it it's have it's we have to understand what the word of God is saying we have to take the words
21:52
seriously not make up things oh this is how to walk in authority and it's something that's not Authority the word
21:58
of God says Authority so let's use our minds what is
22:03
Authority you see what I mean Hallelujah instead of making something
22:10
else up that's not Authority you see the word of God is to be taken
22:17
seriously not to be manipulated and like change the word
22:23
around forgetting what the word is actually saying and making piing up something
22:29
different amen so that's how it is with the fire
22:36
that's why I give this example it we we have to understand what fire is we have
22:41
to understand that just as fire has to be kindled and stoked there's a reason that God calls it fire he's not making
22:48
up some word we don't know he's relating it to fire that we see and feel and
22:55
understand we have to stoke this we have to Kindle this so now when Paul is saying fan into flame he's saying just
23:03
as you have to Fan into flame that physical fire you must fan into flame your spiritual fire or it will die out
23:12
it will but many Believers don't think this
23:19
way many Believers aren't understanding I have to do something I have to
23:24
regularly fan this into Flame or it'll die it'll go out
23:36
the fire of the holy spirit is what keeps you alive
23:47
spiritually so you should never allow this fire to die in
23:53
you I explained to you what the fire of the Holy Spirit does you remember what it does
24:00
consuming the desires of the flesh purifying you to be more
24:07
Christlike igniting a passion for God in his kingdom that's what the fire does if
24:12
you let the fire die these things will return the spiritual maturity the
24:19
spiritual life you've gained it will die it'll dwindle and you'll return back to how you
24:25
were that's why you cannot let this Fire Die ever your life your spiritual life
24:31
depends on it amen
24:38
hallelujah
24:43
hallelujah so when you first when you first have an encounter with God that
24:50
opens up your eyes and you fall in love with him you give your life to him when you
24:57
step into to Revival and you receive Miracles and you're seeing other people be delivered
25:05
and healed and saved it's easy to be on
25:10
fire that's not the time of kindling the fire that's the time the fire has come
25:16
divinely by God God himself has released the fire to
25:23
you it's not the time to stoke it just like when a campire fire just
25:29
begins it's not the time to stoke it yet so there's no work to be done when
25:36
the fire first comes right but then as time
25:43
passes it doesn't become as e as easy to be on
25:50
fire that's when you have to take action intention to Kindle that fire as time
25:57
goes as weeks pass as months pass as years pass don't expect God to divinely be
26:06
igniting you on fire he's done that you've received this now it's up to you
26:13
as Paul says to Fan into flame this gift that was given to
26:20
you amen
26:26
hallelujah the more you regularly Kindle your fire every day
26:33
continually every week every month every year consistently the more spiritually mature
26:41
you will be you will be growing every day you
26:47
will be staying in God's will continually if you keep it
26:54
up so it's about not letting it die always being alert is my fire still
27:01
burning bright not letting it get down to just the Coal's uh you see the Coal's Embers
27:09
or whatever
27:16
amen so how to Kindle this
27:23
fire seek Jesus every day and keep keep
27:28
your eyes on him make the intention to seek Him make the
27:34
intention to keep your eyes focused on
27:40
him be in the word daily read the
27:47
word not religiously but with a heart to hear God
27:52
speak to you and transform you listen to the r word Rama means
27:59
present tense spoken word through vessels where you are planted those of
28:04
you who are planted at 5f church listen to the teachings regularly this is how to Kindle the
28:13
fire and these teachings are anointed there's there's
28:19
um there's anointing coming through the teachings that's kindling the fire you know so I said you know don't
28:26
wait for God to ignite the fire again he he does that once and it's up to you to
28:33
Kindle it and one of the ways to Kindle It Is by just simply listening to the teachings and taking them
28:38
seriously and as you listen it's like I'm it's like it's like I'm as the vessel of God taking the the stoker
28:47
thingy the stick and going like this to the logs in
28:54
you you know and that's Hallelujah and that's why in the middle
29:01
of the message or at the end of the message you feel different you feel lighter you feel renewed you feel the
29:09
fire more on fire that's because you kindled
29:16
it Hallelujah Kindle you Kindle the fire by
29:22
maintaining intimacy with God praying to him and I have a whole series four I
29:29
think it's a four-part series on how to pray the Jesus way on my YouTube so
29:35
watch that because you you will not be kindling the fire by praying in a religious way but praying the Jesus way
29:45
in the new wine way really being intimate with God rather than doing
29:51
religious ritual prayers amen
29:58
and the last uh I also mentioned praying in the spirit praying in tongues that's
30:05
a tool God's given you it's a gift and it's a tool that also K fans into flame
30:10
Kindles that fire as you pray in the spirit praying in tongues and the last uh the last thing I
30:19
will mention Direction I will mention on how to Kindle your fire is to renew your
30:26
mind with these truth truths the Bible says um Ephesians 4:23 and be
30:33
continually renewed in the spirit of your mind having a fresh untarnished
30:39
mental and spiritual attitude so you need to continually
30:45
renew your mind with the word of God with all of the word of God but I want I want to just hone in
30:51
on specific truths words of God that you need to be renewing your mind with
30:56
continually to Kindle this number one is this truth that God loves you so
31:05
much and he's always wanting you to have Victory by Victory by Victory I mean
31:13
he's always wanting you to be victorious over the enemy he's always wanting you
31:19
to fulfill your purpose on this Earth he's always wanting you to be blessed
31:24
and to walk an Abundant Life he's is always wanting you to be close to him to
31:31
have intimacy with him he's always wanting this for
31:36
you he's not only wanting this for you when you're doing good when you mess up
31:43
when you make a mistake he's still Desiring these things for
31:50
you this is basic but but the devil works so hard to
31:56
blind people to these truths when you're doing good when you're on
32:02
fire you see these truths easily accurately you're living in the truth
32:08
but what happens many times is if backsliding happens if you make a
32:15
mistake suddenly you throw these truths out the window many people do many people
32:21
suddenly listen to the devil lying saying that God is so disappointed with
32:27
you that you should feel ashamed that you should feel so
32:33
guilty that he's turned away from you because you've disappointed
32:38
him and he's going to punish you and punish you and these are the maybe you don't
32:45
realize you're thinking this but many of you even right now it could be these are
32:50
the things you're believing these are the lies of the enemy that you're believing the enemy comes in this way I'm revealing how the enemy comes
32:58
because the enemy knows all he can do is lie and the enemy knows that where you
33:04
will have victory over him and shame the devil's Kingdom and destroy the devil's
33:09
Kingdom and be a powerful vessel of God is when you are in close intimacy with
33:16
Jesus and you can only be in close intimacy with Jesus when you're seeing him
33:21
rightly when you're seeing his love for you his attitude towards you rightly the
33:28
devil knows this and that's why you deal with so many of those condemning
33:35
thoughts so you so this is a big way people lose their
33:41
fire sometimes they didn't even make a mistake it's just that they don't feel as on fire as they used to and they
33:49
shame themselves for this which is the LIE of the devil your
33:54
your fire is not about your feelings the more you Kindle your fire the more
33:59
you will feel the fire you'll feel the heat Hallelujah but it's not about your
34:09
feelings Amen to to be to to be on fire and have
34:15
your fire burning really just simply means to be walking and living in the
34:25
truth you you you're rejecting Every Lie of the devil you're taking the word of God seriously you're meditating on the
34:31
word of God and you're doing what the word of God is saying being on fire for God means to
34:39
choose to fear God and choose to be in his will every day choose to serve him choose to do what he is telling you to
34:44
do choose to obey him to be on fire for God means to be
34:52
Christlike to make the intention to be Christlike to love others to serve
34:58
others to be the light of the world
35:04
Hallelujah that's what to be on fire means did I say anything about feelings did I say anything about you
35:12
feel the fire in your hands that means you're on fire did I say anything about
35:18
you feel incredibly energetic no I remember when I was first baptized
35:25
in the Holy Spirit I never felt energy like that it felt like I had tons of
35:31
coffees but not in a bad jittery way oh my goodness I was shocked you
35:38
know but that was that was a a special moment when I was first ignited but on days where like today I
35:46
feel I feel very energetic glory to God but I don't I don't feel like this
35:53
like I have to j a mile I feel calm I feel calm you know but I am on
36:02
fire I can speak like this and be on fire I don't have to be like this and preach like this
36:11
oh to be on fire
36:18
amen but I I remember I would see glory to God I remember I would see you know a
36:23
big reason why it never came to me that I would that maybe God would want me to to be a preacher was that whenever I
36:29
would see preachers they would be so on fire and I looked at their outward
36:36
expression and I was like I've never been that way and I really thought it was just like a natural thing I didn't
36:42
think it was like an act or you know just a preaching style that someone puts
36:49
on I thought it was like real you know that's not real fire I mean don't
36:56
look at preachers is preaching in such a passionate voice and compare yourself
37:03
and think I don't have that amen the fire is is simple just as
37:11
I shared with you it's simply walking in the truth and keeping on doing what God is telling you to
37:19
do you know you look at you look at David in the valley and he's he
37:25
literally is saying he's depressed feeling he's saying why Psalms 4211 why
37:33
are you cast down oh my soul and why are you disqui disquieted
37:40
within me which means like distressed so he's literally saying his
37:47
your soul is your mind your will and your emotions so he's literally saying that he has the feelings right now he
37:54
has intense feelings of depression downcast of
38:01
sadness of distressed that's how he
38:07
felt truthfully so but but what he's saying
38:12
why I love this he's saying why are you cast down so he's speaking to his
38:20
soul because your soul is not supposed to dictate you your life the truth
38:29
because your soul is your mind your will and your emotions and the enemy can come and influence your emotions and
38:35
sometimes not the enemy simply circumstances simply you're in a Valley season going through something hard
38:41
going through a refining fire like David was and you don't naturally feel super
38:46
excited and happy and fiery but he's speak so he's speaking to
38:54
his soul because he knows this his soul is not his truth truth it does not dictate his truth so he's speaking to
39:01
his soul soul why are you this way you shouldn't be this way in other words
39:06
he's saying these feelings are not right these feelings don't align with God's truth I don't want these feelings to
39:14
stay I want to live in the truth instead in God's truth so he goes on to say so
39:19
he's speaking to himself why are you cast down oh my soul that's that's really him saying don't be depressed
39:26
soul these feelings get out of here and then he says hope in God for I
39:35
shall yet Praise Him the help of my countenance and my
39:41
God hope in God so whether he said hope in God or
39:49
whether he said hope in God through tears that's real fire
39:57
H that's real fire of the Holy
40:02
Spirit yeah this is a spiritual discipline that God uh principle that God commands us to do reject the devil's
40:09
lies and speak the truth declare the truth and renew your mind renew your
40:15
mind so you know what to reject and what to declare as this is what's truth that's what he's doing in this
40:22
moment he's rejecting the lies of the Devil he's taking every thought captive to Christ he's renewing his mind with
40:27
God's truth with his word and he's speaking aloud I will hope
40:34
I will praise God he is good he is faithful so I will be full of Hope instead of be
40:40
depressed and distressed
40:45
hallelujah praise God all right so there's mountains and valleys in life
40:51
and so what happens many times is when people get off the mountain they enter the valley that God even LED them there like the Holy Spirit Led Jesus Into the
40:59
Wilderness to be tempted like how Jesus allowed the The Saul to attack to try to
41:05
kill to attempt to kill David God will lead you into a valley out of his
41:11
goodness to refine you sometimes and you won't usually you will not naturally
41:17
feel fire so do not listen to The Devil's lies that you've lost your fire in those
41:23
moments instead what do you got to do
41:28
Kindle Kindle that's what you need to do amen and so there's some people that
41:34
have completely lost their fire because they've listened to the devil's lies saying you've lost your
41:40
fire so what you need to also renew your mind with is the fact that you are
41:46
continually in a spiritual war and it will mostly be in the mind and it will
41:53
most it the devil the war is trying to get you out of intimacy with God is is
42:00
is to try to get you to believe the devil's lies of God's love for you and how he wants the best for you and to be
42:06
in his will and to prosper and to fulfill your purpose
42:11
that's the devil's scheme so you have to renew your mind with this so you're ready when the time
42:18
comes that the enemy attacks in this way and you say uh-uh you will not steal my
42:24
fire I know what's going on here I know what you're trying to to do I've been kindling My Fire by kindling my fire one
42:31
of the ways I've been doing that is by renewing my mind that I'm in a spiritual war and that the enem is going to come with these lies someday so I will not
42:38
believe his lies I will not be tricked by his lies I reject these lies I Kindle
42:43
my fire now this is the truth of God God is cheering Me on he is for me not against me he wants my victory he loves
42:50
me so much no matter what no matter if I make a mistake he still loves me that's my truth and I will keep this
42:59
fire in me I will serve God all the days of my life I will be
43:06
obedient I will stay in his will every day this is what I will do so I speak to
43:12
my soul right now come on catch up to the truth now we're going to praise God
43:18
and serve him and keep our fire alive amen
43:29
amen God's looking for a mature love feelings are
43:35
fleeting loving him based on your feelings is an immature love God is
43:40
looking for a mature love mature love for him
43:57
all right now the the last thing I want to share with how to Kindle your fire is
44:03
to renew your mind with this truth well I want to speak to you first those of you that have backslid in those of you
44:09
that have let your fire die out or it's gotten lower I want to tell you stop
44:17
letting the devil win stop letting him
44:25
win some of you know better why are you allowing the Devil to Blind
44:34
you your eyes have opened up why are you allowing what God has
44:40
revealed to you to be pushed under the bed so that you can't even recall them
44:47
anymore why are you focusing so much on what the devil is speaking that it's
44:52
taking up every area of your mind so that what God has revealed to you has been lost
45:01
L if you've allowed it to go under your bed the truth of what God has revealed to you the truth of who he is the truth
45:10
the spiritual reality truth that we are in a spiritual
45:17
war that a lukewarm life is not the way it is the way to destruction these
45:22
truths you know these truths if you've let them go under the bed where you can't see them they're not
45:30
lost you don't see them vividly right now but you can go under the bed and pull them out and put them to the
45:36
Forefront of your mind and keep them there and kick out what the devil's been filling your mind with you can do
45:45
that amen it says in Romans 122 do not be
45:51
conformed to this world any longer with its super official
45:57
volumes and Customs but instead be
46:04
transformed and progressively changed as you mature spiritually focusing on Godly
46:12
values and ethical attitudes this is the Amplified version so that you may prove
46:18
for yourselves what the will of God is that which is good and acceptable and perfect in his plan and purpose for you
46:26
renew your mind mind on the truth so that you know what the will of God is so
46:31
that you know this way is not the way this this way pursuing the desires
46:37
of My Flesh is not the way this is the will of God you have to be clear in your mind
46:45
you know if you let the if you stop focusing on the word of God and you let the devil fill
46:51
you you you'll become confused you'll become deceived
46:58
you'll be like fooling yourself you're allowing the Devil to fool yourself you know when you're
47:05
spiritually mature full of the word of God you can clearly discern the will of
47:11
God you can clearly discern no that is not the right way this will be opening
47:16
up a door to the enemy this will be displeasing to God but when you allow the devil to fill
47:24
you you don't take the word of God's seriously you're not kindling your fire you start to give an ear to these
47:30
desires these thoughts of the flesh the devil's planting you'll become deceived by the
47:36
devil you'll be oh it's not so bad to do this I can do this this is
47:43
okay you know you you you I I can try I can do this thing in the world it's
47:52
okay and it's like the truth has been pushed so far under the bed
47:58
that it's able to be like muffled the voice of God be
48:04
muffled hard to hear and so this is how a lot of lukewarm people live they're living like
48:13
not really hearing conviction because of their choice of filling their mind with the
48:21
devil's voice devil coming as an angel of Light
48:28
in their mind forming them to be
48:34
lukewarm like this is how the devil moves when you're a Christian when you're in the truth when you're in the light he usually won't try to tempt you
48:41
with um really really you know like doing
48:47
heavy drugs and and sleeping around with people and and things like this he'll come as an angel of light in
48:54
a sneaky way saying oh it's okay to do this it's okay to do this you
49:01
see so um this is a wakeup call for some some people
49:07
here a wakeup call because you know you've been living differently and now you know
49:14
why you know you lost your fire some of you and now you know
49:20
why allowing the enemy to take over your mind it it's deceived you it's brought
49:29
this um wrong doctrine that living lukewarm is
49:37
okay so this verse says do not be conformed to this world but be transformed and progressively Changed by
49:43
the renewing of your mind so that you may prove what the will of God is that's
49:49
why I say Renewing Your Mind is so important so that you can clearly hear
49:55
the voice of God knowing this is God's will this is the
50:01
truth amen hallelujah Proverbs 14:12 there is a way
50:07
that seems right to a man but its end is the way of death Matthew 16:25 for whoever desires
50:15
to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it for what profit is it to a man
50:21
if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul or what will a man give in exchange for his soul
50:27
so these two scriptures that I just read this one and the previous one there is a way that seems right to a man but its
50:32
end is the way of death I shared stop letting the devil win you know some of you who have
50:40
backslid and I'm speaking to some of you here some of you online for whoever this is for you know you know you have
50:46
backslidden but it's time to remember the truth that that you hid away but you
50:55
know you know there is a way that seems right to man so you think you can live in this
51:04
kind of way that's not fully really surrendered but in its but really the
51:11
it's a path to destruction in its way is death the word says
51:18
so wake up wake
51:23
up this you know these the temporary
51:30
gratifications it leads to death it's not worth it some of you who are back who have
51:36
backslid in it's leading to death when you if you if you see the
51:44
road this way and you can clearly say death is this way and you see the road this way life abundant life eternal life
51:54
intimacy with Jesus is this way okay is that a hard
52:00
Choice I'm saying like if you physically could see it like if you physically could see hell hell on Earth and Hell
52:08
eternally not just hell after we after you after one passes away but I'm
52:13
talking about hell on Earth torment demons and all that demons bring
52:20
lack um losing your mind no protection
52:27
so if you could physically see that if you could see the future your life how you'll be tormented how you
52:35
will be experiencing hell on Earth and then you also see hell in eternity you can see the sulfur and the lake of like
52:42
fire and everything and every all of the horrible things of hell all of the death
52:48
and torment of hell you could see that physically like physically okay not imagining it and then seeing physically
52:55
with your eyes like like seeing the future seeing how God blesses you seeing how how much joy you experience in his
53:03
presence being an intimacy with him seeing how you are fulfilling your purpose and making a powerful difference
53:09
in this world for the kingdom of God seeing how God's protection is over you and you go glory to glory and he
53:15
just keeps blessing you and blessing you and blessing you for his glory and because he loves you and it's a reward of serving him seeing how the desires of
53:23
your heart are being fulfilled can you imagine seeing these things
53:32
physically how could you why would you not want to choose this this way the Jesus
53:39
way the way of the path of surrender the narrow road
53:44
how how so there's there's some of you who
53:50
have backslid in and it you know this you know this but you've pushed this
53:55
truth under the bed you've you've chosen to forget it because you you you like so much the
54:03
temporary gratifications of the flesh it's not worth
54:10
it this way is the only way this way isn't just a much better
54:16
way it's the only way to life eternal life it's the only way to be protected
54:22
it's the only way to not be tormented by the devil it's the only way to fulfill your purpose is the only way to be
54:28
blessed and have your blessings protected it's the only way where you'll receive the desires of your
54:35
heart this is the only way surrendering your life to Jesus there's no lukewarm Road the
54:42
lukewarm road is the road to death and
54:48
destruction so God is opening up eyes
54:54
today because some of you you know this you have this head knowledge that you've
55:01
pushed away stop letting the devil fool
55:06
you a day longer a second longer he's fooling you he's tricking you
55:15
completely stop it don't let him
55:22
anymore amen hallelujah
55:33
Revelation 23 and I know that you who believe are enduring
55:38
patiently and are bearing up for my name's sake and that you have not grown weary of being faithful to the
55:46
truth but I have this charge against you that you have left your first love you
55:52
have lost the depth of love that you first had for me so remember remember the Heights from which you have fallen
55:58
and repent change your inner self your old way of thinking your sinful
56:06
Behavior seek God's will and do the works you did at first
56:13
when you first knew me otherwise I will visit you and remove your lampstand the
56:19
church its impact from its place unless you repent
56:27
so it's time to repent those who have become lukewarm those who have let your fire gone out
56:33
those who have boxl in it's time right now to
56:40
repent it's not too late you can always start
56:48
again even if you are cold right now there's no condemnation in Christ if you've gone cold there is no
56:55
condemnation in Christ stop now being condemned this message that I'm sharing
57:00
you sharing with you it's meant to be conviction not condemnation God the the Bible says
57:07
there is no condemnation for those who were in Christ Jesus there is
57:12
none so as I share this message and God is speaking God is not speaking
57:17
condemnation God is speaking conviction God is coming with love and
57:22
seriousness saying the way you're going is the way that leads to to death and you know this you need to remember this
57:28
and you need to make a choice and change repent change your direction change your thinking change your actions and follow
57:36
me fully surrender everything this is what God is speaking is there any
57:41
condemnation in that did you hear any condemnation in that no there's no condemnation and this is so important
57:48
you know you will never be able to keep your fire alive ever if you keep
57:54
believing the devil's Li of condemnation you have to decide once and
58:00
for all to not listen to the lies of condemnation the devil sending you have
58:06
to see God's love accurately to receive his help to transform
58:11
you to follow him [Music]
58:17
amen God Is So merciful he is so merciful it doesn't
58:23
matter what you've done it doesn't matter how far You' backslid in look at the mercy and Grace that God had
58:29
for Saul who became Paul Saul was killing not just he was killing people
58:35
but not just any people the the ministers the Servants of God carrying
58:40
the power of God to advance the kingdom of God to do God's Works he was killing
58:47
these people he was leading a a group of people to kill these people but God has
58:53
so much grace for him and mercy for him he opened his eyes he gave them him the
58:58
choice to turn and repent and turn to Jesus and he did and he didn't just say
59:03
oh well your past was so bad so you can just be have an ordinary life he gave him literally an extraordinary
59:13
life acts 1911 the most extraordinary acts 1911 says that God did God did
59:19
extraordinary Miracles through the hands of apostle Paul it literally says extraordinary
59:28
so Saul's Destiny his purpose was not destroyed because of the sins he
59:36
did because of the bad things he did it was not destroyed at all was it it wasn't too late for Saul it's not
59:45
too late for you Peter
59:51
Hallelujah Peter was given great honor honor to receive the kingdom the Keys of the
59:58
Kingdom from Jesus God chose him to be his Rock his leader of his church that
1:00:04
he would build his church on this Foundation of Peter The Rock he gave
1:00:11
specifically Peter the Keys of the Kingdom what does Peter do he's given
1:00:16
this highest honor he's given this greatest responsibility he was the F we're all disciples now like Peter but he was the first
1:00:23
one the first one to be a leader of the other disciples wow what
1:00:29
responsibility and what does he do he denies Jesus not one two but three times
1:00:36
denies that he even knew him and was with
1:00:41
him he made horrible mistakes but did he ruin his future his
1:00:47
Destiny his purpose nothing changed he repented
1:00:53
Jesus wiped away his past and he didn't say oh well you know I'm going to change
1:00:59
your calling now because of how you made a mistake when you should have known better and I'm going to take the Keys of
1:01:05
the Kingdom from you and give it to another disciple and make them the rock no he remained The Rock he remained with
1:01:11
the keys God forgave him Jesus forgave him and restored
1:01:18
him it wasn't too late for Peter it's not too late for you
1:01:27
it's not too late so stop listening to the devil stop
