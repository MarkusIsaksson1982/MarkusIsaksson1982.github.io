it's important to realize that when it
0:01
comes to thoughts and feelings the devil
0:05
many times influences them and you
0:09
actually have control over your thoughts
0:12
and feelings meaning if there's a
0:14
thought and feeling there that you don't
0:16
like to be there you don't have to let
0:18
it stay there the Bible says submit to
0:21
God resist the devil and he must flee
0:24
this is a spiritual principle God's
0:26
spiritual principles are laws they must
0:29
happen
0:30
there's so many different principles and
0:32
laws like what you seow you will reap
0:34
that's a principle it will happen this
0:37
principle of resisting the devil and he
0:39
must flee this must happen cuz it's a
0:42
principle in the kingdom of God you
0:44
don't have to worry about it not working
0:46
it will work meaning your Authority in
0:49
Christ will work the devil must flee
0:52
when you resist him so when you are
0:54
seeing certain thoughts prideful
0:57
thoughts this is a moment to renew your
0:59
mind and realize I don't want that there
1:02
that means it's not me that means this
1:05
is sent from the enemy that means I have
1:08
power over this the Bible says submit to
1:11
God so I'm going to submit to God's
1:12
truth he doesn't want me to have this
1:15
thought this emotions he doesn't want me
1:16
to have this prideful thought so I'm
1:19
going to submit to what God wants and
1:21
I'm going to take the action I'm going
1:22
to walk in my authority like God
1:23
instructs me and I'm going to resist the
1:25
devil by taking the thought captive to
1:28
Christ and using my authority using my
1:32
words because our words carry power and
1:34
that's one of the big ways we execute
1:36
our Authority I'm going to use my words
1:38
and say I reject this prideful thought
1:40
and whatever kind of thought or feeling
1:42
that it is that you don't want there
1:44
that you recognize by being spiritual
1:47
Renewing Your Mind it's come from the
1:49
devil so reject it and then be at peace
1:52
first of all realize that God is proud
1:54
of you instead of condemning yourself
1:57
that you had a bad thought be spiritual
1:59
and realize the reality that the devil
2:01
planted this but you did what God wanted
2:03
you to you took action you rejected it
2:07
and God is proud of you for that and the
2:10
fact that you rejected it means that
2:13
that isn't you that that thought isn't
2:15
you that feeling isn't you so God for
2:18
sure is not disappointed by the feeling
2:20
you felt or the thought you had he's
2:22
proud of you for being victorious in
2:26
this spiritual attack and doing what he
2:28
has commanded you to do
