today I'm going to be teaching on a message called religionless relationship
0:06
with God and I'm going to be helping you in
0:12
your relationship with God how to be free of religion and how to experience intimacy how to experience God's grace
0:19
and how to get all of the religion out of your life amen the spirit of religion
0:25
that is when one thinks that their salvation and the righteousness and their good standing with God is based on
0:32
works is based on what they do when Jesus came and destroyed the curse
0:39
of religion where that used to be true uh and he destroyed that curse and
0:46
now he has brought Grace and now he has removed all of our sins so we don't have
0:51
to be doing all these laws to try to cover up the sins but Jesus has removed
0:57
the sins um by his Grace and so when we come to Faith In Jesus when we come to
1:03
believe that he is Lord our savior he wipes away our sins um the past sins and
1:09
also sins that could come in the future as long as we keep on repenting and turning to him and genuinely we're sorry
1:16
he's he's continually wiping Away The Sins so um now God wants us to have
1:23
relationship with him and intimacy and he wants us to have the Revelation that we're already in good
1:30
standing with God we're already the righteousness of God it says we're the righteousness of God in the Bible that's
1:35
what he calls us so we're already in good standing with him we're already his
1:41
righteousness um and we're already his beloved children just because we've come
1:48
to faith in him and because of what he has done because of his grace now all we
1:53
have to do is believe in him and and be surrendered not just be Christians that
1:58
believe he exists and believe that heaven exists but surrendered children
2:03
of God that then turns it to be so I mean it makes it then be
2:09
that you know parents on this Earth that adore their children they wake up and they're excited to see their children um
2:16
their children their children do just smile and laugh or something and their their heart just gets so happy you know
2:25
they they just adore their children on a daily basis um you know even if the
2:30
children are you know wreaking havoc or something you know doing troublemaking things at
2:36
sometimes but in their hearts their children they just adore right um so
2:43
that's how God sees us so like every day we're in that like good standing we're in that place of a real daughter and son
2:51
we're not every day trying to work our way trying to live up to being a child
2:59
of God where we're not striving and trying to do all these things every day so that we don't lose the right standing
3:07
that's what religion is that's part of what the spirit of religion is the spirit of religion also brings
3:14
condemnation it's trying to bring you back to the time of the law before Jesus came where because we cannot uh do ful
3:22
we can't we can't fulfill the law we you can't do everything perfectly all of
3:28
those Commandments before Jesus came you couldn't do that um and so therefore
3:33
there would be condemnation that would come like man I could not one day could I fulfill what's
3:41
required uh before Jesus that's that was the life not one day could I fulfill what's required and so therefore came
3:48
condemnation like oh man I'm horrible man I'm just never ever ever ever ever
3:53
good enough uh that Spirit of condemnation comes with that uh wrong
4:01
thinking of I must achieve my salvation and righteousness I must do all the
4:07
right things it comes together the condemnation and so today we have um
4:14
people still living in the spirit of religion and
4:20
Paul talks on this Galatians 3:1 what is happened to you Galatians to be acting so foolishly you must have been under
4:26
some evil spell didn't God open your eyes to see the meaning of Jesus crucifixion wasn't he revealed to you as
4:32
the crucified one so answer me this did the Holy Spirit come to you as a reward for keeping all the Jewish laws no you
4:38
received him as a gift because you believed in the Messiah your new life and the anointed one began with the Holy Spirit giving you a new birth why then
4:45
would you be so so foolishly turned from living in the spirit by turning to finish by your own
4:52
works so Paul is saying why would you so foolishly turn from living in the spirit
4:58
by trying to finish by your own works so he's speaking to Christians and
5:04
this is a message for us today like this is it's like I'm kind I'm kind of like speaking how Paul was speaking to
5:10
Christians to to you today why have you turned away from what you have learned
5:17
what you have learned about Grace why are you living religiously why are
5:23
you forgetting what God has revealed to you of who his heart is of his amazing
5:29
love that he is so forgiving that he has so much grace that he has so much Mercy that he has so much compassion that he
5:35
understands sometimes when you make a mistake his compassion is there why are you jumping suddenly to God is
5:42
condemning you when you make a mistake rather than immediately jumping to see God's
5:47
grace so um you know even this is a prophetic teaching right now like why
5:53
are you acting so foolishly like a reminder you have and and some of you maybe this is new maybe you've never
5:59
learned Lear about God's grace maybe you've only been taught the wrong Doctrine religious Doctrine but for some
6:04
of you you have learned you have known your eyes have opened up but you've kind you've kind of teetered back to the old
6:11
religious ways that you used to be in so this is a prophetic now word for you to
6:19
return to your first love for you to return to intimacy relationship fellowship and by the way this is really
6:25
good for us to renew our minds always of this um because years pass years pass from when
6:34
we had our first you know big encounter with God and we fell in love like the
6:41
honeymoon stage of a relationship of a marriage years pass a
6:47
a good marriage um has to take intention and requires work um at first it doesn't
6:53
require much work doesn't require much intention you're feeling butterflies around your um lover all the time your
7:05
fiance your new new husband or new wife you're feeling butterflies all the time
7:11
you're feeling madly in love all the time but um so at first you don't need
7:16
to take intention to have intimacy and love your partner well your husband or
7:24
wife well but as time goes on you need to take intention you need to um set
7:30
aside you life gets busier kids come in the picture so you need to set aside time you need to make a practice you
7:36
need to make intention to have a date night to spend time just the two of you
7:41
and to take intention to love your um husband or wife well in a way that would
7:48
touch them and instead of just going about the dayto day mundane routines you
7:54
know you have to take intention so today is a good reminder for many of you where you you used used to have that fire and
8:00
that intimacy uh with God and it's kind of burned out but you haven't lost it it's
8:07
just that you need to rekindle it you need to renew your mind and you need to change your life from today where you
8:14
you know before maybe you're like that married couple that never makes intention but you need to know now oh I
8:20
need to continue to make intention I need to continue to renew my mind of who
8:25
God is of How He Loves Me of the encounters I've had with him where his love was made known to me so vividly and
8:34
clearly you're you know these encounters that we've had
8:39
with God where our eyes have opened up to his love and we just blown away um they don't happen every day and
8:46
many times we want we want to go by feelings and we want those we want just those
8:54
crazy intoxicating lydy moments with Jesus of
8:59
like our eyes opening up we want those all the time um but it just doesn't work
9:05
that way we God gives us special Precious Moments where he opens our eyes
9:10
huge encounters but we're called to not leave those in the past but keep them
9:17
with us keep that Revelation alive in us and renew our mind that this is really who he is this is really who he's shown
9:23
me to be this is what he's thinking about how he's thinking about me this is how he sees me this is his
9:31
voice we have to do our part in that I'm just going to kind of be speaking today
9:36
on how to have this religionless relationship with God in different aspects I'm going to be covering just
9:43
kind of a bunch of topics uh one of them right now I'm going to I want to share is is first of all God's grace
9:52
that Grace means undeserved favor and it is
10:00
It Is by God's grace through faith that we are saved Grace is such a big
10:08
part of Understanding God's love for us uh and you know as I was just saying
10:15
you have to continually be renewing your mind this is how God sees me this is really God's love um this is this is
10:21
what he's shown me what what I've learned about him Grace has to be a really big part of
10:29
of of this Revelation that you're Renewing Your Mind with Grace Grace is undeserved favor meaning you don't
10:36
deserve it but but God loves you so much that he gives it to you so this is really important uh
10:44
aspect Grace is kind of like the opposite of religion Grace is what wasn't there before when it was religion
10:51
and then Jesus came and he he broke the
10:56
curse of religion the curse of the law by the power of his love and grace these
11:04
things conquer death conquered everything overpowered so uh we don't deserve to be
11:13
saved we don't deserve um to live we don't deserve to even exist we don't deserve to have breath in our lungs but
11:21
because God loves us simply he has given us Grace so he's Grace is a gift it's a
11:29
free gift that that our father gives us just CU He Loves Us simple we have the
11:35
best father in the world it's like we have a a a a millionaire in the spir a
11:42
billionaire in the spiritual realm you know that just spoils us with so much we don't deserves but he just loves us so
11:48
much that he can't help it by spoiling I mean just like lavishing us with so many blessings we don't deserve in the
11:55
spiritual realm and also transcending into the Physical Realm in terms of like
12:00
provision and and blessings from God so
12:06
um when you're when you're living your dayt day and you are not perfect you make a
12:14
mistake you you don't live perfectly how God wants you to live it's so important
12:21
that that you have spent time each day throughout
12:26
your day Renewing Your Mind with how God sees you his love his grace so that in the
12:34
moment that you make a mistake that you don't do enough or
12:40
something you you miss the mark you immediately are seeing God rightly you
12:47
are immediately remembering his grace
12:52
so Grace and condemnation are the opposite many Christians live in the realm of
12:59
condemnation instead of Grace they make a mistake devil speaks the condemnation
13:05
voice and God's speaking the grace voice but people don't renew their mind to
13:12
know about God's grace so they don't hear God speaking in a whisper his grace
13:17
and they instead hear the voice of condemnation the voice of condemnation is so much louder because for
13:25
one I mean the devil wants you to live in this condemnation that's how he pulls you away from God that's how he keeps
13:32
you from from turning to him because like Adam and Eve you turn away you cover yourselves you are like oh God is
13:39
so angry he's so disappointed and he doesn't want to see me right now and I'm actually kind of afraid you know he's
13:44
just so angry at me he's so mad that I could mess up that I actually don't even want to see him and I know he doesn't
13:52
want to see me because he sees me as disgusting right now that's what people that's what Adam and Eve thought that's
13:57
why they hid cover themselves and that's what the devil aims to do for every
14:03
Christian all the time whenever they make a mistake is speaking that voice hoping they'll think it's God so in turn
14:10
they'll run away from God instead of to God and the far the more we run away from God the harder it becomes
14:16
to uh be in God's will be helped by God and
14:24
uh live rightly and it it's like you're going the opposite way so you start living in the worlds and you just then
14:31
you just start going the devil's way instead of God's way um we need to come
14:36
to God so he can transform us so he can help us so we can live by the spirit it's towards God that this happens
14:41
looking towards God coming towards God so uh what you really need to do is renew
14:48
your mind of God's grace so renew your mind of God's grace all the time you know be meditating on the word of God on
14:54
his grace on his love on how he sees you renew your mind like in the Bible
15:00
there's so many stories of of flawed um people people people who were
15:07
children of God who were Servants of God but that messed up but God forgave them and God gave them
15:13
Grace the Bible is full of that so renew your mind of these stories in the Bible this is who God is this is his grace he
15:21
forgives me when I mess up and so even in the moment when you're not messing up that that heart that knowledge is
15:28
already in you God's God God's word is already in you so when the condemnation
15:34
voice comes you're able to have this moment of wait here's this moment I
15:40
messed up but God loves me and he has Grace for me
15:45
and I don't need to be afraid of him I need to run towards him he has the arms open of the father of the prodigal son
15:51
right now um and then you're able to reject the the voice of condemnation so
15:59
um really Renewing Your Mind intentionally with the revelation of God's grace is very very very important
16:07
it's a way to be equipped for battle in the times when the devil attacks with that voice of
16:13
condemnation um You probably will find that you make some sort of mistake in
16:18
your life so you got to be prepared for that moment you should be thinking of that right now even like if I were to
16:24
make a mistake tomorrow um How Will I Be God God prepare
16:30
yourself God has the arms of the of the the father of The Prodigal Son open wide
16:36
for me that's how he is so I I mean when when your eyes have opened when you've
16:42
heard the message I shared on Sunday and also today when your eyes have opened up of like man I've really been allowing
16:48
the Devil to lie to me about God's voice speaking condemnation believing the condemnation Lies when you have this
16:56
Revelation get to work in the spiritual Realm real like prepare yourself you
17:01
know your eyes have seen you don't need to go back there you do not need to be tricked by the devil again but you got
17:08
to be a warrior you got to meditate on the truth of God's grace and prepare
17:15
yourself say Lord help me to see rightly if I ever make a mistake again help me
17:22
to see you rightly help me to never listen to the voice of condemnation again I don't want to run away from you
17:27
ever again I only want to run closer run closer to you every day of my life
17:33
that's all I want God make that your intention so then you'll start to notice when you're feeling in your heart man I
17:40
don't feel like spending time with God right now I don't feel like reading the word I don't feel like you know you
17:45
catch yourself you're like what no I promise God I promis myself I would never do this I already know that that's
17:52
just a scheme of the devil when I'm starting to feel those feelings that's not from God and I'm going to reject it I'm going to run to God whether I feel
17:58
like like it or not in the moment this is how to be spiritual you're doing the spiritual work of
18:04
Renewing Your Mind Renewing Your Mind is one of the biggest parts of being a mature
18:10
believer being a spiritual person Renewing Your Mind it's making your mind
18:17
sharp in the spirit so it can't get confused it can't get tricked by the devil it's solid in the truth you know
18:23
Jesus was so solid in the word of God in the truth when he was led by the holy Spirit to be tempted by the devil in the
18:30
wilderness the devil tried to trick him so many times um tried to twist scripture but
18:39
Jesus had the word of God in him so deeply that he just had Victory after
18:45
Victory after Victory and so that's how it should be for us today that's that's how to have that's how to be spiritual
18:51
very spiritual mature and how to have victory over the devil today get the word in you so deep get the truth of who
18:58
God is in you so deep get the schemes of the devil in you so deep so you really
19:03
know what the devil's up to okay so I also want to talk now about condemnation
19:08
versus conviction condemnation versus conviction there's a big difference and
19:15
um when you make a mistake this is how it should be when you make a
19:20
mistake you should have this
19:26
immediate re remembrance and knowing of God's grace coming for you in this
19:32
situation in need this is a moment where you're like I need God's grace and so
19:38
you see his grace and then you immediately are just thankful for his grace because you know how undeserving
19:45
it is you know it's it's like wow Lord I Thank you so much that in this moment
19:50
I've made a mistake but your Grace has covered it right now thank you Lord your
19:57
heart this should be your heart Heart Of God you're so good you're so good Your
20:02
Grace is so amazing thank you but usually what Christians do is
20:09
they immediately hear that condemnation voice believe it and they immediately turn towards themselves and think about
20:16
themselves they immediately think how could I do this I'm so awful I can't believe I did this I'm unworthy I'm a
20:24
disgrace I'll never be good enough I'm just B and they're just thinking of themselves thinking of themselves
20:30
thinking of themselves and how bad they are um kind of think kind of forgetting
20:35
that we need God to do anything it's not we can't do anything without God
20:41
so I mean you you don't have the ability to be perfect on your own to to not make
20:48
mistakes on your own and so when you're looking so internally you're you're just
20:54
removing God from the situation and you're making it about what you can can do what you can't
20:59
do um and you're you're you're you're you're leaving God's grace on the table you're forgetting God's grace completely
21:05
which is sad because God Jesus Paid such a price for this Grace he endured scourging he
21:14
endured a a a a crown of thorns on his head he endured being hung on a cross
21:22
for a long time before he then died he endured all of that for this gift of
21:27
Grace for you in this moment of your mistake and you're leaving it on the
21:33
table so that's sad you know that's we need to have this Revelation
21:38
more and more so we don't leave this Precious Precious valuable gift on the table and we value what God has given us
21:46
instead of be selfish and be thinking about ourselves and how we're we made a mistake you know so first of all when
21:55
you are seeing God rightly you will immediately be thankful of his grace wow
22:00
Lord I deserve like punishment for this but instead you're giving me Grace and you're forgiving me and it probably will
22:07
make you emotional when you really have the right Revelation about it because his grace is is just so
22:14
precious you know and then from there conviction will
22:19
come conviction will come I mean like this conviction meaning like a desire in
22:25
your heart to
22:30
to not make the mistake again a desire in your heart to be more
22:38
intentional to live to please God you know like if the mistake you made was
22:43
because you weren't serious enough about your surrender you weren't really
22:49
valuing God enough you weren't making that priority to please him completely
22:55
so the conviction will come and you'll feel feel like this this burden in your
23:00
heart I want to please God I don't want to do this again I want to please God cuz he's worthy his love is amazing I'm
23:08
so undeserving and I just want to please him I love him so much his love is so amazing and it it it Grieves me that
23:16
that he was displeased in this moment you know that that I did something out of his will that Grieves me and I don't
23:23
want to do that again so I want to I want to live perfectly live I mean
23:31
not saying you know putting pressure to be perfect but having that heart of Lord I literally want to be in your will
23:37
every single day every step I want to take in your will I don't want to take a step out Lord help me God I really want
23:43
this I really want to please you and it turns into this prayer it
23:49
turns into this Cry of your heart it turns into this big passion you didn't have before that's conviction and that's
23:56
coming from the Holy Spirit and it's coming Gent eventally it's coming it's coming um because you have made the
24:02
decision that you want to please God that's why it's coming it's not coming forcefully and it's and it's a it's a
24:09
loving conviction it's a it's God saying this way leads to death but this way
24:16
with me leads to life so I don't want you to do that anymore that you just did
24:21
cuz I love you I want you to do this here you will find true life here you
24:27
will ple me here you will go from glory to glory and be a powerful vessel of God
24:33
I'll be able to entrust you with anointing you will see Abundant Life choose this way and God may be doing it
24:40
seriously in a serious tone but it's with complete love it's with no condemnation the Bible says there is
24:46
therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus it's in complete love it's in seriousness but it's in
24:53
love and so the convicted heart will feel grieved will feel sad for a
25:01
moment that they that they stepped out of God's will but it's not condemnation it can be
25:10
sadness for a moment that is not
25:15
condemnation that is not putting yourself down seeing yourself as bad and
25:21
and wrong we should all see ourselves of needing God's grace we should all see ourselves as we're not perfect we have
25:28
ways to go but in not a looking down upon ourselves eye but just in a
25:33
humbling eye that's how it should be that's how
25:40
the conviction that leads to repentance should happen the Bible says it's the kindness of God that leads to repentance
25:47
so that means that this is really God God is coming with this love yes is
25:53
seriousness but love not condemnation and that is kind that is so
25:59
much kindness and when you're seeing God accurately and rejecting the voice of condemnation you will be able
26:06
to receive that kindness and that conviction and it will lead to
26:17
repentance whereas when you condemn yourself condemn yourself oh I got to do better next time you're not you're not
26:24
looking to God for help you're like hiding from God and trying to make yourself better to then try
26:31
again but you're not accessing God's grace you're not living by the spirit
26:37
you're trying to do on your own so that's going to make you actually more sinful
26:42
like let you're not receiving God's grace you're trying to do on your own so when you're being convicted through
26:50
condemnation it's not going to work it's not going to work there's not going to be repentance it's going to go the other
26:57
way you're going to lose your love for God you're going to be forgetting God's love
27:03
for you more and more and more and
27:17
more okay so now I want to talk about what relationship with God should look
27:23
like relationship with God should look like intimacy
27:28
friendship it should look like real relationship yes God
27:35
is a spirit where all your other relationships are human
27:44
physical but we really it really needs to be a
27:50
relationship from the heart like how you have with humans on this Earth
27:58
it should not be robotic it should not be um just going
28:03
through the motions and reciting prayers but it should be real intimacy
28:11
it should be having the awareness Renewing Your Mind and having the
28:16
awareness that God is with you always always he never leaves you he's
28:21
beside you right now he's in you and beside you with you right this
28:28
second and he will be there 1 minute from now 1 hour from now 2 hours from now 5 hours from now when you're
28:34
sleeping this night he'll be there he'll be alert he'll be awake and he'll be looking at
28:40
you with Eyes Of Love right now and every second after and every day after
28:48
he's with you when you go to the Post Office the bank the work to church on your walk on your run on your hike to
28:55
the gym in the car on the train on the bus he's with you on the plane he's with you in all of those
29:03
places and he's not sleeping he's awake and he
29:09
wants you to have the awareness that he is with you all that time he doesn't want you to ignore him just like a
29:16
friend on this Earth you shouldn't ignore them if you were with a person
29:21
24/7 you wouldn't ignore them if you loved them and they loved you so much you wouldn't ignore them you wouldn't be
29:27
talking to them 24/7 if you're with them 24/7 you're not going to have enough things to talk about and that's totally
29:33
fine you don't need to be talking all the time that's too much actually you're going to be talking about random stuff
29:40
maybe you're going to be talking just because you think that that means you're closer is you're experiencing intimacy
29:45
because you're talking no same thing for God you should be talking with him you should be listening to him but at the
29:52
same time there will be moments of Stillness there will be many moments of Stillness there will be many moments of quietness there'll be many moments where
29:59
you're just having the Revelation he's with God is with me right now God is helping me right now God is loving upon
30:05
me right now you know like how your your spouse or best friend
30:12
or your mother your father I don't like if you're with them sometimes they just glance at you with eyes of such love you
30:18
know sometimes they just give you a smile that's just full of love so that's God all the time God is
30:25
constantly loving up upon you all the time and so what he wants to do what
30:31
what he wants you to do is simply do what you would do with if your best friend was with you
30:36
24/7 um I mean in terms of intimacy in terms of relationship renew your mind and be
30:44
aware constantly that he is with you and um put your eyes upon him regularly
30:50
throughout your days as you're doing work as you're doing tasks invite him in
30:57
in occasionally say I love you God thanks for being here with me thanks for
31:02
helping me with this every time you notice um you're able to do something
31:08
you're maybe you're surprised like wow this worked I was able to figure this out or get something done or get
31:15
something done within a certain time or whenever you're like accomplishing something invite God into that moment
31:21
and thank him for that thank you Lord for helping me with this thank you Lord that I saw you there that was
31:27
Supernatural thank you God thank you so much God um what God the most important
31:34
part of your relationship with God is this intimacy throughout your days that's that's relationship versus
31:39
religion uh many many Christians do not have intimacy they don't have relationship they have religion so they
31:47
um they they they they don't have this awareness that God is with them all the time and that God is loving upon them
31:53
all the time but rather they they they picture God as being like far away and
32:00
kind of judgy all the time like kind of looking at them and seeing if they're going to mess up we're seeing if they
32:07
will complete the checklist of all the things required to be a good
32:13
Christian so like they have in their mind I have to read the Bible I have to pray I have to do this I have to do that
32:20
and they live their lives like I have to do I have to do this I have to do this or I've blown it or I'm not a good
32:26
enough Christian or they have this in their minds and so they're living their lives like that so they're living their
32:33
Christian lives in that way they're reading their Bible in that way they're praying in that way of I have to do this
32:39
I have to do this when it should be I get to do this and when I do this this
32:44
is intimacy with God this is relationship with God this is me spending time with God this is me hearing from God this is me touching
32:50
God's heart reading the Bible spending time with God praying that's what it should
32:56
be
33:01
so um when you're when you're praying to
33:07
God uh I want to talk about different kinds of prayers different kinds of how to pray to God one of them is praying as
33:14
a friend Proverbs 18:24 one who has unreliable friends soon comes to ruin
33:19
but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother there is a friend who
33:25
sticks closer than a brother and that's Jesus that's what that word of God is
33:30
saying so Jesus is our friend what a friend we
33:35
have in Jesus Jesus is our friend and um this intimacy and relationship God needs
33:42
you to see him as Lord as father uh but also as friend in order
33:50
for you to have this intimacy that he wants where you know he's side by side with you like glued to you all the time
33:58
24/7 as much as you have reverence and respect for someone for God there also
34:05
needs to be that feeling of com you're comfortable like you you you you like he
34:11
wants to be with you all the time you know he's choosing to be with you all the time he knows everything about you
34:17
and he's looking at you with so much love all the time and he wants the best for you so you need to have that um view
34:24
of him as a friend in order for you to have this intimacy when you only see him as
34:30
Lord um and father maybe you might experience more of a distance and and
34:37
and be seing picturing God more up in heaven and not speaking the same language as you and that could be why
34:43
you're struggling to have intimacy because you're not renewing your mind that he is a friend that sticks closer
34:48
than a brother so um one of the ways you should
34:55
pray to God and prayer just means communication with god um in religion many Christians think
35:02
prayer means like prayer means only like um time in
35:08
your room and saying these prayers passionately at the top of your voice maybe and they're kind of
35:17
repetitive and um and the words that you're speaking as
35:22
you're praying are are not even words you would say in real
35:27
life um but it's something that you are doing you are doing I am praying something you are doing but it should be
35:35
actually communication with God communication with God and
35:43
um you need to make sure you're having this intimacy with God
35:48
where you're talking to God how you talk normally not in some foreign language not in NK not in KJV language but how
35:57
you talk like how I demonstrated earlier thank you God for helping me with this I needed I needed I couldn't have done
36:04
this with the way you would talk to your best friend talk in that way because that's going to help you um see him
36:12
rightly and experience that intimacy and not forget about him with you all the
36:18
time wanting to engage with you as a friend all the time so friendship
36:23
prayers are going to be like a lot of your prayers friend the like praying as a friend is going to be a lot of your
36:28
prayers like bringing him throughout your day as this partner as someone who's just with you all the time as God
36:35
who's with you all the time bringing him throughout your day talking to him intimately as a friend um just saying
36:41
one or two word things sometimes just including that just including him all
36:47
the time sometimes it can doesn't have to be even words but it can be with your heart
36:53
sometimes and just putting your eyes to him and um he knows your heart he knows
36:58
your mind he knows your thoughts the second type of prayer that you should be praying is prayers that are asking God
37:07
for things but because when you the Bible
37:12
says this the the god directs the steps of a righteous man or woman when you
37:17
when you are really in God's Will and living by the spirit and your steps are being Guided by him you will find so
37:25
many things just come in your life from God like your needs just come provision
37:31
just comes blessings just come you will find when you are not also thinking
37:37
about yourself but you're thinking about just pleasing God you'll find yourself not wanting I shall not want not wanting
37:46
for anything like you feel so content and you you find yourself content and you find God Is providing so many things
37:53
and things that you didn't even pray for ask for dream about you just find these
37:58
things coming in your life so asking God for things isn't something that will be
38:04
happening tons of times every day asking asking asking um when you really live in
38:10
this right way because God is just this is just part of the Abundant Life that comes from God as you just serve him in
38:17
his will these blessings just fall upon you fall upon your lap and the provision the Bible says you have I've supplied
38:24
for you all your needs in the spiritual Realm they are there and so when you follow the principles of accessing these
38:31
blessings like sewing sewing into God's kingdom that's a big way of of like of
38:38
accessing God's blessings go the provision a lot of people are asking asking asking asking but they're not
38:44
doing the principles they're not sewing and it's never coming and they're asking so many times but they're not sewing
38:51
they're not doing the right principles or you know maybe they're being lukewarm they're not being surrendered they're not coming to church regularly and
38:58
taking it seriously um receiving the anointing and receiving equipping they
39:03
aren't following the principles but they're ask ask they're asking so much they're asking all the time they're spending so much time praying and
39:09
asking and and it won't come but then someone who doesn't even ask much but is
39:15
doing the right principles in the word of God and the kingdom of God of
39:20
accessing the blessings and the Abundant Life they're not even ask having to ask
39:26
much cuz God knows our needs you know so most of the time he isn't just standing
39:32
there like waiting you hav't asked you Haven an asked but there is a scripture that says James 4:2 you do not have
39:38
because you do not ask God you have not because you ask not so there are sometimes when God does want you to ask
39:44
but he wants you to ask in good motives he wants you to ask with a good heart
39:49
and he wants you to ask it ask for it as a desire of your heart that's
39:54
pleasing to God not as selfish desire it says in James 4:3 when you ask
40:01
you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives that you may spend what you get on your
40:07
pleasures so when you are asking that's why I say you probably won't be asking too many times you probably shouldn't be
40:14
asking all the time for things if you're asking all the time all the time you're probably asking with wrong motives you're probably asking for things out of
40:20
selfish desire and not and not to fulfill God's purpose but the things you
40:25
ask for should align with God's will they should align with God's will so those that and
40:32
and they should be asked with good motives that when he gives you these things you will use it according to how
40:37
he wants not your selfish desires uh and then another prayer is more of like a
40:45
partnership with God prayer which is walking in your Authority prayer or
40:51
declaring prayer uh like that's a lot that's like
40:58
when you see like me Minister that's declaring walking in Authority prayers
41:04
God has called us to walk in authority to have dominion he's told us to cast out demons he's told us to heal the sick
41:10
he's told us to raise the dead so meaning he's calling us to be praying
41:16
declaring prayers be using the authority God has given us and say demon go be
41:24
healed to the Dead come alive but as we're saying these we
41:30
aren't like really like saying directly to God we're actually speaking to the
41:37
darkness and using the authority God's given us and and commanding it to go but God has given us his anointing
41:45
his power and so the reason demons go when we say demons go is because of God
41:53
partnering with us God's anointing God's power moving through us so we walk in authority but God is the supernatural
42:01
force that makes the demons to obey that
42:07
makes Darkness to go the demons see us as partnered with God so when we say do
42:13
this they see God is going to be behind what was said so they see like us and
42:19
God as one you know like together team um so if we say
42:24
something it's not us saying it it's God backing us God connected to us saying
42:32
it that's powerful powerful Authority Hallelujah and and so when you whenever
42:38
you find darkness in your life and your children's life and your family life whenever you find
42:45
um times that the enemy is attacking bringing attack on your life this is a
42:50
moment for you to pray with these declaring authoritative prayers walking
42:56
your Authority I declare this Darkness here to go I declare
43:02
um every attack of the enemy trying to attack the finances right now it must leave in jesus' name and as you're I
43:11
declare these nightmares in my child they must end now I declare the sickness
43:17
in my body must go I declare my the sickness in my child must go and
43:23
um as you're praying these declarative prayers you should also bring God into it thank him like understanding that
43:30
you're doing this together and then thanking God thank you Lord for taking away this pain for healing me for
43:36
healing my child for taking away the nightmares thank you Jesus that you have done this I believe you have done this
43:41
in the spiritual realm it is done so you you you bring him into that you don't
43:47
just walk in your Authority and forget God but you renew your mind that he's with you doing this right now and you
43:53
thank him for his power that it's his power alone that's doing
43:58
it and then the last kind of prayer is the prayer that you should be
44:06
praying most of the time which is praise and thanksgiving praise and
44:14
thanksgiving be thanking God continually the Bible says thank God thank God
44:20
always and continually and thank and praise Him continually believe this in Philippians but it says like praise and
44:27
give thanks continually at all times uh so I mean the truth is is that
44:36
our life on this Earth it's it's just covered with God's grace it's covered with God acting our behalf sending
44:43
angels to protect us uh it's God directing our steps God
44:51
defeating our enemies for us like our dayto day that's what it's looking like our dayto day God is just doing so much
44:58
and so much that we don't realize he's he's protecting us from things we do not even realize like car accidents we don't
45:04
even realize how he's been protecting them from us from attackers and jealous people and
45:11
just the devil trying to attack Us in all these different ways and God is protecting us all the time he's at work
45:18
all the time there's so much he's doing for us all the time and so it's really
45:23
weird and not good to just be blind to that and not be thanking him continually
45:29
and praising him continually you know if you could really see all that he's doing you would be saying thank you thank you
45:35
thank you thank you thank you thank you God thank you God thank you God thank you God I praise you
45:41
God you couldn't help to just like on Earth if I don't know this person gives
45:48
you a gift and then the next second they give you another gift and the next second they get they do something else that blesses you you're not just going
45:54
to be like you're GNA be like thank you thank
46:01
you thank you duh right so how much more for God and it's true we don't we don't
46:08
see all that he's doing but he we we we should live we should renew our mind once again man God's doing so much for
46:15
us all the time and sometimes like I have these moments where I'm like I
46:21
remember you know God healed my skin and I've been like just remembering how it used to not be the way it is now and
46:28
it's been a long time since you healed it but I'll like look at the mirror I'm like thank you God for healing my skin
46:34
and um sometimes you know colds are like
46:40
colds they can happen normally and seasonally it's not you know the devil always but um it is a blessing to
46:49
be living more of Abundant Life when it comes to like cold some people may may may get like four colds a season and but
46:56
you don't get any colds or you get one cold and if you get a cold it's very quickly or something and so sometimes
47:01
I'll have these moments where a lot of time is past and I've just been healthy day after day after day after day I've
47:07
been healthy and my body feels good for so long like no issues and it's been a
47:13
long time and I'll just like wow thank you Lord for my health thank you God for
47:20
protecting my health like day after day for a long time since I can remember now months and months and months and months I I've just been feeling so good
47:27
physically and not tired and you know I'll have those moments where I'll just thank you God so we should be thankful
47:34
people we should be remembering that God is just doing so many things for us on a
47:39
daily basis that we forget about and when life's good we forget about what it could be like what it used to be like
47:47
you have to be intentional to renew your mind so thinking for the little things it's beautifully sunny out in Los
47:52
Angeles today and I love the sunshine I love the blue sky thank you Jesus for the Blue Sky oh and I see clouds out
47:58
there this is real life right now by the way I literally see beautiful clouds that are white and they're so puffy and
48:04
they were like that yesterday too and it was so gorgeous I drove to the Barnes & Noble and I was like thank thank you Lord they're beautiful and usually in La
48:11
if there's no clouds in the sky at all which is a blessing too but it's beautiful to see clouds once in a while so just just living your your life like
48:19
attention to God's blessings everywhere and just being grateful for little things and big things and and and and
48:26
making your eyes aware of the blessings in your life and and always bringing God into it and always thanking him for it
48:33
um if you feel like you don't know what to pray you feel like you don't know what to like you run out of words to
48:40
pray you're probably praying the wrong way you're probably not putting your focus where you should be and your focus
48:46
should be on prayer and Thanksgiving that's what I that's the most time I spend praying God or in
48:52
prayer to God is prayer and Thanksgiving and it's very simple thank you God God you're
48:58
amazing like that's praise it doesn't have to be Hall would be thy name it can be God you're
49:03
amazing that's praise wow God you're so good that's
49:09
praise like throughout your day in the shower in the car God you're so good thank you
49:16
hallelujah hallelujah if you think about it he's so he's in control he has you in
49:22
his hands there's nothing to worry about he calls us to take authority in some situations he calls us to ask him for
49:30
things sometimes but for the most part he's calling us to thank him and praise him and rest in him and be in intimacy
49:38
with him receiving his love and pouring out love upon him um which many times
49:44
looks like working for him serving him loving others working in his ministry
49:50
Hallelujah I feel the love of God thank you Jesus I lastly want to end with um I
49:55
want to just briefly talk right now about reading the Bible
50:00
so relationship with God it looks like two things for the most part prayer
50:07
which is communication with God intimacy like what I've just been covering and reading the word reading
50:14
the Bible the Bible says that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was
50:22
God is God the Bible is God God God's voice is in his
50:29
word uh and so because the Bible is God
50:35
that's why it's reading the word is such an important part of our relationship with God because it's a big part of
50:41
where we're hearing his voice and where he speaks to us on a regular basis and
50:48
where we get to know more of who he is his heart how we're able to comprehend
50:54
his love more um and be transformed more into His Image
51:00
so we can love him well and and love him the best by being in his will and being
51:07
like him first of all in religion a lot of people as I shared a little bit earlier think I need to read the Bible
51:16
every day this amount and pray and then I'm a good Christian and then I'm in
51:23
good standing with God and they but they live like that and it's wrong the truth
51:28
is is that we should read the Bible every day if possible things come up sometimes so that's okay if that does
51:35
but in general most days we should read the Bible and we should be praying
51:41
communication with God we should be doing those things every day but the
51:47
motive behind you doing it is very important the religious motive of I'm
51:52
doing this to feel like I a good Christian and so then I think I won't
51:58
feel condemnation and God will be good with me this is why I'm doing it and you
52:05
have to be real with yourself if that's deep down the motive that's a spirit of religion you need to be free of and
52:11
reject that that voice of religion in your life and and be aware that there's
52:17
been that wrong Doctrine in you in your heart there's been that performance and work works and lack of revelation of
52:24
God's grace and there needs to be transformation now so how it should be is this how it
52:31
should be is I love Jesus I want to spend time with him I
52:39
want to hear his voice and I want to be intimate with him I want to talk with him and I want to
52:44
hear with him and I know this pleases him to spend time with him and I want to
52:50
please him because I love him that should be the motive that
52:55
should be why we read the word and pray spend time with him communicate with him so
53:04
um it's good to make habits because if you don't you you you have to set out
53:10
intention or else things get put on the wayside it doesn't mean that you're not prioritizing them that they're not
53:16
valuable to you uh but if you don't take intention
53:21
it becomes that way so because you value spending time with God reading the word
53:26
prayer you should prioritize it you I mean you should prioritize it
53:31
by by scheduling it in your day by making a habit because it's just how it goes the day just passes things come up
53:38
when if you don't schedule and prioritize and so what you want to do is
53:44
make sure that you're not priori prioritizing exercising um being on social
53:52
media um uh uh watching
53:57
TV work over time with intimate time with God in
54:05
his word and through prayer now the amount of time of set aside time of
54:12
reading the Bible and intentional prayer that will look different
54:18
depending on the season and this is where you have to make sure you're being led by the spirit and not being
54:26
religious because for example all of a sudden in my life I I started traveling
54:32
crazy got one one week I traveled to on a plane to four
54:38
cities ministered or was it five four or five cities I forget I think it might
54:43
have been five four or five and ministered in each of them and the
54:49
flight was delayed 5 hours one time and came an hour and a half late to the
54:54
service people people were just waiting because the the flight delayed we had a service in um uh uh Bradington or
55:02
Sarasota Florida then flew to a city in New Jersey and that's where
55:10
we were delayed but people stayed and God moved so powerfully and delivered so many people and then we were supposed to
55:16
immediately run a car and go to um DC to minister the next day but there was no
55:22
more rental cars that night and so last minute we had to get a hotel at like 1:00 in the morning and then we had an
55:29
issue trying to rent a car the next day because I happen to take my credit card
55:35
out of the wallet by accident when I left home and so you had to have a credit card not a debit card and so we
55:41
took a lift like 5 hours to DC from
55:46
Virginia and then ministered that night and then um I think that there was
55:52
another city I might be missing but but it was like it was a different season a
55:58
crazy season and so when you have like days that like that and life happens in five-hour delay and stuff like that uh
56:06
it might mean that that that habit that you've created um it didn't wasn't able
56:14
to happen that day and that's where it's okay and you have to understand that God God's with you the whole day
56:21
and so what's important is that you're spending intimate time with God you're throughout your day that's what God really cares about that you're bringing
56:27
him throughout your day every day you're being intimate with him you're you're you're Renewing Your Mind that he's with
56:33
you all the time and you're including him in your day that's what he cares about the most and then he cares that
56:39
you're in the word as much as you can but not in a religious way that has to be exactly this time or this amount of
56:46
time this amount of chapters every single day and if you miss one day God's
56:52
disappointed that's where it's religious that's where it's making it about Works holy spirit is like the wind he moves he
56:59
breathes sometimes he can call you to do something like what I just shared and it literally means that I couldn't do the
57:05
regular habit uh of reading the word that day that I had planned to but God
57:12
actually allowed that to happen I mean it was not doing something wrong on your
57:17
part you know so um you have to understand that like reading the word of
57:23
God is kind of like God as a person um he's still with you and when you're
57:29
going to read the word of God it's time to spend time with him and to hear from him it's not this like you have to do
57:35
this and if you don't do this today then you blown you blown it but God's a
57:41
person and God understands and you haven't even missed God God's been with you throughout the day and you spent
57:46
time with God in a different way that day important things you should do be doing though is Renewing Your Mind with
57:53
the scripture um throughout the day if if you if that day you didn't read the Bible you should be
57:59
you should have gotten the word in you so much that you're already thinking about the word you're um the Bible says
58:06
Joshua 1 18 keep this book of the law always on your lips meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to
58:11
do everything written in it then you will be prosperous and successful so the Bible says you should meditate on the
58:17
word of God day and night so um if you don't read the Bible one day it's not that you're not you're still reading the
58:23
Bible technically if you do this if meditate on the word day and night H and sometimes that's how God will want you
58:28
to read the Bible sometimes one day he'll want you to read one verse and just meditate on that verse
58:34
and just think about it for a while and take maybe just 15 minutes just with one verse and just think about it and just
58:42
hear from God as you're meditating on one verse sometimes and um even maybe
58:49
God will just holy spirit will lead you I just want today instead of usually reading tons of chapters or something
58:55
like you usually do I want you just one verse today you need to be led by the Holy Spirit as you read the word of God
59:01
otherwise you can be just reading it just to get through it to finish it in a
59:06
certain amount of time and because you're doing it with that intention you're missing God's speaking God needs
59:12
you to take time somewhere but you're missing him completely because you're
59:17
not coming with the right motive you're not coming with your ears open the right way you know so um so yeah so even on
59:25
that day where um you couldn't read the Bible something happened God's not concerned that day
59:32
maybe actually God wanted you to remember a verse you read the day before and to like think about it a lot that day maybe there was it was a stressful
59:38
situation like me with the five hour delay and we didn't know if we'd make it on time we didn't make it on time but
59:44
people were still there uh maybe God want you read a verse about
59:50
um you keep in perfect peace those whose mind is fixed on you and and and maybe
59:56
that day God wants to teach you how to have perfect peace in a new way maybe you've always allowed stress to come and
1:00:04
this day after you read in the word yesterday now God today wants to put what you read in the word into action
1:00:10
this day and he wants you to meditate on that day that verse all day this is this is following the Holy
1:00:16
Spirit to read the word and it'll look different it'll look different with Seasons it'll look different with days
1:00:22
with each day so by the way I want to reiterate it is good to make habits it's
1:00:27
not religious to make a habit to set aside time this day this this time every day I'm going to read the Bible because
1:00:34
if you don't just as humans it's human nature it ends up not happening you can think in your head oh yeah at the end of
1:00:41
the day I'm going to read this but you have to set out make intention schedule
1:00:47
it in so that it actually happens but but be okay if something
1:00:54
happens where you you're not able to you don't have to freak out about it don't be religious about it so have Revelation
1:00:59
whenever you read the word of God this is me spending time with God and I'm hearing his voice that's how it
1:01:07
should be when you set out to read the word of God some people they don't feel like reading the word of God they feel
1:01:13
like maybe they don't understand it um if you're feeling that way if you're
1:01:18
feeling this strong feeling it's like you don't want to read the word of God you feel this like H I don't want to
1:01:24
read it and I don't really understand it and d d if you're feeling that way first of all renew your mind that that's the
1:01:30
enemy it's the enemy coming with the spirit of religion trying to make you think
1:01:37
like if you don't understand this then you're not a good enough Christian and
1:01:43
it's you're not having the right revelation of God's grace and love and that as you read the word of God you are
1:01:49
going to hear from him and this is pleasing to God so renew your mind that
1:01:55
you're having the wrong Revelation you're hearing from the enemy if you're feeling these things and just reject all
1:02:01
voices that are trying to keep you from reading the word of God and then renew
1:02:06
your mind with this truth that I'm sharing today that as you read the word of God you were spending time with Jesus you're spend you're spending intimacy
1:02:13
with him you're hearing about his heart the Bible contains God's heart it's how we learn about his heart his love his
1:02:20
grace his Mercy his forgiveness his compassion it's how we learn about how how he has been faithful to his people
1:02:27
and as we learn that then we we're able to get to know him better as this God
1:02:33
and friend who was with us all the time we get to know how he sees us better we get to know how we can trust him better
1:02:38
we get to know how faithful he has been with them so he'll be faithful with us too um renew your mind like this Bible
1:02:46
is a treasure even if I don't understand everything right away it's okay to not understand everything right away if you
1:02:52
find yourself not understanding it by the way start in start with the New Testament start in the gospels start the gospels
1:02:59
to uh read about Jesus Jesus's life on the earth and so because it's so
1:03:06
important that you understand Grace if you start with the Old Testament and you're not reading Grace you're not able
1:03:11
to understand really what God wants you understand God wants you to know Jesus
1:03:16
know his grace know what he has done know that he has di know why he was
1:03:24
sent and that he died for us and that he rose from the grave and like this is our life now with the holy spirit it's
1:03:30
important for you to understand that and then you can go back in the Old Testament and you read it with the lens
1:03:36
of Grace you read it understanding this was before Jesus came so this isn't
1:03:43
exactly how life is now but at the same time there it God didn't just say
1:03:48
throughout the Old Testament it's part of the Bible and it's not just it a lot of it is like his history like for us to
1:03:55
know um for example there's a lot of lineage happen descriptions like this had this then this person had this son
1:04:02
and this was his name and d and and that's powerful to show the lineage of Jesus and it's powerful how it shows how
1:04:08
God chose really imperfect people chose people who had a really bad past sometimes um to be part of the lineage
1:04:15
that Jesus came from that can give us revelation of God's grace that God can
1:04:20
even use us to do powerful things or even if our father did something really horrible but God can wipe all of that
1:04:27
away and make us not connected to that but be pure you know and do powerful things for us so there's there's just a
1:04:34
bunch of Revelation that God wants to give us through even things that seem boring that we don't understand but as
1:04:41
you just will read the word as time goes on God will start to speak these things
1:04:47
to you you'll start to hear him um
1:04:52
so and there's there just so much from the Old Testament that that that God wants to give you revelation of things
1:04:58
that apply today I mean there's so much even about um the Bible says the Yoke
1:05:04
shall be destroyed because of the anointing that is in Isaiah that's in Old the Old Testament but that applies
1:05:10
to us completely today there's parts of the Old Testament that aren't in the New Testament exactly but apply to the New
1:05:17
Testament apply to New Covenant Life like the anointing destroys the Yol for example so like we need the Testament
1:05:24
there's stuff God wants to speak to us for today in our lives in our spiritual lives to open our eyes in the Old
1:05:29
Testament um but if you're struggling like I have a hard time understanding start with a new testament so you can
1:05:35
really get to know Jesus's heart and and then when you read the Old
1:05:42
Testament in the spiritual realm you your eyes have opened up and you're literally going to be able to see God
1:05:48
better more in the Old Testament what he wants you to see of him and learn from him about him and you're ears will be
1:05:54
opened up more to hear God's voice to speak Revelation to you
1:06:00
um and and it's okay if you're not every single verse you're not having this like
1:06:07
mindblowing lifechanging Revelation it's not going to be like that and that's
1:06:12
okay um like it won't be you'll sometimes
1:06:17
you'll have a mind-blowing life-changing Revelation but I think a lot of people feel like they read a chapter one night
1:06:26
and they didn't like feel anything they didn't like have this crazy Revelation that's okay you're not going to always
1:06:31
have that but God's like he's putting his word in you and he's doing things without you really knowing it and he's
1:06:36
building upon you he's building this foundation so you can really know him his story God's story God's
1:06:46
story of like for thousands of years before you he's building God's story him
1:06:54
in you he's doing things Without You realizing it so when you read the word you should have that Revelation like the
1:07:01
word's coming inside of me right now the word is coming inside me right now I don't know exactly all that God's doing
1:07:06
but the word is a spirit and as I read with the heart to hear from God with the
1:07:13
heart of um I just I'm doing this to please God
1:07:19
and to have intimacy with him not to just do this but have coming with the right motive the right heart
1:07:24
you will be receiving the spirit of God in your life as you read and you
1:07:29
sometimes you won't feel anything sometimes you won't have crazy Revelation but the spirit will be coming in you the word will will be built in
1:07:36
you um becoming stronger and stronger and stronger and sometimes you'll find I
1:07:42
was reading Genesis and um the Amplified translation I was reading it and it was just talking about Abraham and and God
1:07:49
said I read the scripture a couple weeks ago God said um
1:07:55
um your reward will be so great because of your
1:08:00
obedience and just that one verse just spoke so much and it just
1:08:08
spoke so much of when you and then it went on to say how God was going to bless him so much and those who would
1:08:14
curse him would be cursed and those who bless him will be so blessed like God will bless them and just reading this
1:08:22
Old Testament scripture just you can receive so much like Revelation this is
1:08:29
how it is for me today you know God will bless who bless me God God just has my
1:08:35
back you know and there is reward coming through obedience God sees all that I'm
1:08:42
doing in the secret place God sees it all and there's going to be reward
1:08:48
and wow like it's just more than worth it to serve God you know
1:08:54
so that's just a little example of when you read the Old Testament how God can surprise you and just start to speak to
1:09:00
you in the Holy Spirit through an Old Testament story where maybe you're reading and you're like this feels dry
1:09:08
or something or I'm not getting all this crazy Revelation but as you just keep going and just with that heart of not
1:09:15
just trying to do it but I want to hear God and I'm expecting to hear God God will surprise you and he'll suddenly
1:09:21
speak to you in his word hallelujah thank you Jesus so I do believe that
1:09:28
after this teaching your lives will be changed forever I do believe that from
1:09:34
today your relationship will with God will be at a completely new level and
1:09:40
you will experience intimacy you will receive Revelation like never before a
1:09:46
big key of experiencing intimacy and hearing Revelation from God
1:09:52
is being free of religion the spirit of religion because the spirit of religion is pointing you away
1:09:59
from God so when you're free of religion there's nothing uh trying to pull you
1:10:04
and you're able to run directly to Jesus every day so your life is looking
1:10:11
like intimacy closeness with Jesus every
1:10:17
single day hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord I declare
1:10:25
over over you right now that every Spirit of religion that has come to try
1:10:32
to bring you pull you from God and knowing his love I declare must leave
1:10:38
you in jesus' name I declare all of the
1:10:43
wrong religious Doctrine that's been built up up in you so big and tall I
1:10:49
declare that to be knocked down and removed out of your life and in Jesus
1:10:55
name may your spiritual eyes open up to see God's love for you to see his
1:11:03
grace to see his nearness his closeness to you to see his
1:11:09
adoration upon you I speak the fire of the Holy Spirit to come upon you
1:11:20
now may you be filled with the the fire of the Holy
1:11:26
Spirit and may you grow closer and closer to Jesus every second of your
1:11:32
life from this moment may you move closer and closer to him every day may
1:11:37
you grow in Revelation of his love in the spiritual realm more every second of
1:11:44
every day may you grow more in love with him may your revelation of his love grow
1:11:50
more and may you become more like Jesus every day may you hear his voice in the
1:11:56
word as you read it from today from today may you hear him in his word and
1:12:01
may this hunger and fire to be closer to him to hear his voice burn in you may
1:12:07
reading the word of God and spending time with him be the most exciting part of your day in Jesus name in Jesus name
1:12:20
amen me
1:12:25
you leave me all and
