welcome to the Revival is Now podcast
I'm Apostle Katherine Crick and I'm so
excited for what God is going to do in
your life today as you watch or listen
so today I have a guest with me here
Shane welcome thank you so much for
having me Apostle it's truly an honor Oh
Glory to God well Shane you have been at
fivefold church for how long now uh
since 2021 since uh July I believe
amazing praise God and and you are
serving at fivefold church you such a
blessing with what you do for God at
fivefold church many times you are
catching people who are falling back
with God's power making sure they don't
get hurt but just can focus on receiving
and you are singing on the worship team
amen praise God thank you for serving
God thank you so much for having me it's
truly an honor it's the greatest
blessing of my life oh glory to God
so you came originally from Tokyo Japan
right I did yes is that where you were
born born or raised uh I was uh there
till I was
15 okay and then when you were 15 where
did you did you move to America or yeah
I went to high school in Hawaii and then
yeah then College out here to USC where
in Hawaii uh aahu Honolulu I went to
eani school Hawaii is beautiful love boy
wow so then you moved from Hawaii to LA
yeah I did a year in school in Arizona
in Tucson then I went to school in La
for 4 years and been living here ever
since okay and I remember the first day
you came to fivefold
church I remember it was in the Park
yeah at wasn't it at um when we were at
the near the gene arre Museum uh yeah so
that was the first time I saw
deliverance and I count that actually
technically as my first day was really
planed uhhuh but you know I've been to
the revivals now New York in 2021 oh
that's right I I went to Pan Pacific
maybe every other week okay I only got
saved that year so My Faith was still
very small and 5f isn't like a normal
church too so I was very skeptical of
not only a five but of everything
honestly because I just came to the Lord
um but yeah so that it was the second
weekend of January 2022 is when i s
deliverance and I count that as when I
was really planted but yeah I've been
going on and off in 2021 as well so you
didn't know Jesus until just a few years
ago yeah till 2021 wow and then after
you found Jesus you shortly after found
fifel Church yes this the first church
I've ever been planted wow praise God so
what happened once you came to fivefold
church did you get delivered what
happened um so yeah when I first went
like I said I was kind of skeptical and
I was kind of watching from the sides a
little bit but in 2021 towards the end I
like I think around October I did uh
receive baptism of the holy spirit so
you laid your hand on me back then I had
like longer hair uhhuh I remember yeah
that was at Pan Pacific do you want to
share any more testimonies of
Deliverance or transformation that you
saw happen in your life or just Abundant
Life that you've experienced yeah I mean
I think another thing that struggled was
adulterous thoughts as well um you know
before receiving Deliverance I struggle
with thoughts about you know other
people's wives or girlfriends uh there's
a lot of generational curse of adultery
in my family um and you know I'd have
dreams about other people's wives and
girlfriends um and then you know after
renouncing that after seeking
Deliverance uh you know I no longer
struggle with those thoughts I feel like
I have a better relationship with women
too you know I kind of grew up in the
world uh very lustful honestly um but
also there was a yoke of adultery in my
family and I remember you sharing that
testimony wasn't it like by by by that
generational curse you mean like it it
happened generation to generation where
there was like there was adultery taking
place yes yeah my father cheated on my
mother got a divorce uh my grandfather
had a child at a wedlock uh and my
grandmother on my father side I got
remarried three different times and not
for you know adultery so she just got a
divorce because she wanted to marry
another man so yeah there's been you
know and they lived tough lives there
was a lot of bondage a lot of Oppression
so you you know my heart goes out to
them and my family as well you know but
uh there was definitely a bondage and a
yoke of adultery in my family I remember
you sharing this
testimony recently like how in college I
think you said that like your friends
wives you would have like lustful
thoughts towards and you didn't want to
have them right no yeah I remember uh
yeah I would this was when I first came
to Lord too um and growing up I was
Catholic but I didn't you know I wasn't
a professing cath I didn't believe in
Jesus it was kind of like a cultural
thing like my family is Catholic but
they don't believe in Jesus well they
say they do but I don't know but um I
went to uh confession and you know I
told the priest there like I'm
struggling with uh adulterous thoughts
I'm having thoughts about my friend's
wife and he told me to you know pray the
hell Mary and all that and you know pray
to Mother Mary which you know I you know
I I got respect and all that but but I
don't know I feel like after that I was
like uh I don't know about that and uh
that's when I kind of first more leaned
in towards Christianity and towards 5f
as well because I I was kind of
teetering on both sides but um but yeah
I did struggle with that for
sure thank you Jesus for Freedom wow so
those thoughts you don't have them
anymore no no I don't have them anymore
after you renounce after I renounced
yeah in the power of God Amen freed you
amen hallelujah amen thank you
Jesus and I remember a a testimony you
shared about
sewing you want to share yeah so my past
job um I wasn't getting paid that much
honestly uh was maybe like 50k a year
which is not bad but you know in La
that's not that much money um and uh I
remember in the beginning of last year
you kind of had a message about if you
want to get out of poverty need to s
more which is kind of contradictory to
you know the world you know you should
keep money if you're bored right so I
remember I was sewing like crazy I was
sewing actually to get I was sewing and
going into debt by sewing which now I
know you know you got to have wisdom
with being radical so maybe that's not
God's leading but maybe it was for me in
that season cuz he just calling you to
really kind of like sometimes like God
will call you to that like in the Bible
when the wealthy man says what must I do
to inherit eternal life be saved and
Jesus says it's easier for a camel to go
through the the eye of a needle than for
a wealthy person to go to heaven to you
know and so he says well this is what
you must do you must sell everything you
have give it to the poor so there are
sometimes where he calls those extremes
it wasn't that every person is supposed
to uh every wealthy person must become
poor and give away everything no it was
for that specific situation
prophetically that wealthy man had an
idol of wealth and Jesus saw for him to
be free of that he had to get rid of
everything and even experience being
poor MH debt you know so in some
situations yeah this can be the leading
of the holy spirit amen and um yeah I
was you know tithing you know 500 bucks
at a time like uh consistently kind of
consecutively like day after day
essentially not crazy amount maybe like
for 2 days or 3 days which was a lot for
me back then um and I didn't really see
much fruit at first you know I would get
like big sales in my job but our job
isn't commission based so even though I
get a big sale I wouldn't really see any
in my pocket physically so I kind of
stopped but then like two three months
later I a recruiter reached out to me on
LinkedIn and long story short I got a
new job and the pay increase you know it
bumped up to 75k and now I make 84k but
basically the jump was exponential like
almost double almost double wow yeah and
I know wow I know that doesn't just
happen you know that's powerful amen I I
need that more of that uh more of that
Faith to sew you know cuz I feel like I
was I'm on fire for Jesus but I feel
like I was like more radical back then
power of sewing when you sew into the
kingdom of God God opens up doors that
are not natural but Supernatural
Supernatural Abundant Life amen amen
hallelujah are there any other
testimonies you'd like to share um what
God's done for you yeah it's just you
know going glory to glory um you know
like I said when I the day when I first
renounced to now I'm just a completely
different
person um just growing by the teachings
seeing all the Miracles the anointing
even just feeling the anointing oh like
the Sunday after flourish so that Sunday
I was just going to ask you about that
yeah yeah uh that was I never felt God
before like that um I've never fallen
I've fallen back before but you know I
don't like to force things yeah you know
I feel like a lot of people they force
things I'm not saying they do but I
really want to feel God I'm not going to
force it you know and I like that Sunday
so we were singing Catch the Wave last
song and I was singing it with all my
heart like I believed the lyrics like
this is the Year this is the time like I
was
and I was I wasn't singing it like
angrily but I was like singing it with
like a passion like come on Worship the
Lord you know what I mean and uh yeah I
just started like drunk in the spirit I
just spinning essentially and I was like
what is going on I'm coughing on
stage and then after the song's over I
go down and I feel like everyone was
kind of drunk in the spirit I don't know
if there're as drunk as me but I know
John to was definitely drunk in the
spirit too um but I was downstairs I was
on the couch I couldn't move CH salum
came in and I remember back then I was
feeling kind of jealous thoughts towards
her honestly unfortunately you know just
like oh me want to be lead or whatever
and I feel like as she came in like I
told her I love you chis Salu you know
cuz I just I didn't want any of that cuz
it's disgusting thoughts and I feel like
I was I was talking to the Lord too like
what did you what what just happened
what was why was I coughing what's going
on and I feel like God put on my heart
they deliver me from
Pride um you know because I used to
struggle a lot of jealous thoughts and I
had jealous thoughts towards you too
Apostle um and I never had those
thoughts before ever I was back then I
was so eager to do work for the kingdom
that I was like going out of order and
then like you know it was like oh well
Apostles is doing stuff I want to do
stuff too I never struggled with those
thoughts at all but it was the devil was
just attacking my mind of you got to you
got to go out and Evangel you got to do
all this we went to a Mother's Day
service cuz my mom is she knows like the
minister at this church and I just like
there's no power of God here like you
know we all we all worship the same God
but I just I'm so glad I'm at 5f as
other people have spoken over me about
leadership and not that's why you
shouldn't really take prophetic words
from anyone else from your covering cuz
maybe God doesn't want to reveal that
kind of stuff to you cuz the devil used
that to mess your mind and that's what
he did with me your message was about
the importance of serving and you should
be honored to even scrub the toilet I
feel like you were preaching to me and I
was like I scrub the toilets and then I
kept coming and you said I could join
the servy team I scrub the toilet and
then now I'm on the worship team which I
didn't even really want to be on the
worship team uh I mean I don't know if
this is of God or not but one morning I
woke up and I had this knowing of like
tell John T you want to join the worship
team and I was like I don't know is that
a God or is that not a god um and then
you know Austin encouraged me that I
should join as well cuz I would sing
around him hoping that he'd say hey man
you got a good voice you join the
worship team I was like I was I was
going to take that as
confirmation but yeah long story short
yeah the devil tried to take me away
from the anointing so many times and you
know with the prideful thoughts the
jealous thoughts just anything he could
throw at me and I feel like you know the
the the there's still fleshes like if
I'm going to be real too I feel like I
have thoughts of struggling with
authority like submission to Authority
MH I don't know maybe it's cuz I grew up
in the world I know I'm a new creation
maybe cuz I'm a man you know prideful
you know what I mean that's definitely
how the enemy comes yeah yeah and you
know I want full deliverance from that
or not even thinking that like you know
with my boss even with you sometimes
just like submission to Authority even
with God unfortunately because he knows
all my thoughts so I'm not afraid to say
it uh but yeah I know I'm a work in
progress you know I only got saved three
years ago God gives grace to the
humble this is humble what you're doing
right now really admitting that saying
you don't want this problem this
resistance to submission to authority to
respecting
Authority and so God gives grace to the
humble and he's giving grace to you
right now
amen I declare every lying Spirit every
stubborn Spirit every spirit that has
