i cancel every demonic covenant she made when she did witchcraft and I declare
every spirit attached every last spirit of witchcraft must leave her on three in
Jesus name one two

thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus i had lost control
of my body i got so deep into the oul i learned everything i had opened up a witchcraft shop the more doors that I
opened up the darker my interests had become as the the demons began to take a hold basically I gave so much power to
the enemy they started like physically um like um touching me and abusing me
and they were showing me where I was going i saw it but I saw the demons the
serpents everything fire hell and saw the different beings i saw a cave of
fire and there was an enormous demon and he was made of fire and they were showing me like this is where you're
going to go so for me I thought how am I going to make it out alive but Jesus
gave me peace in a moment I realized my whole life I like I was
deceived and I was like I have to I have to seek Jesus and the demons were like
just like no like yelling through me they fell they were just throwing this fit you know because my eyes opened up
and they couldn't stop it welcome to the Revival is Now podcast
i am so excited for what God is going to do through this podcast today i believe
God's going to touch you in power lift your faith and bring freedom if you need
deliverance i am so blessed and excited to have April here with me today welcome
April hi thank you for having me i'm so honored to be here for Jesus hallelujah
your testimony blesses my heart so much when I think of you I think of Mary
Magdalene god has delivered you so powerfully and in a short time you had
transformed radically and I praise God to see what he has done in your life the
freedom he has brought and how he has brought you from darkness to light from death to life life and so I know already
there's been many many who have heard your testimony who have seen it online videos of your deliverance have gone
viral multiple times for the glory of God and so I know many eyes are opening
up to see the reality of demonic oppression and the reality of Jesus our deliverer who comes in power to destroy
every yoke so but I'm so excited because I I I believe that there's some people today who haven't yet heard your
testimony and are going to be so blessed and their faith will be lifted so high through your testimony so I'm so excited
and I I'm excited for people to hear your whole story yes so I want to start
from the beginning uh you came to 5F Church not too long ago just a matter of
months not even a year ago when when was when was it that you came to 5F Church uh my first deliverance was in November
actually november so that was your first time coming november of 2024
and here we are filming right now is just only months later
so what brought you why did you come to 5F Church what was going on in your life
up to that point yeah so um before coming to 5F Church um I was actually um
I had lost control of my body i um was in the oult i started maybe 2020
2021 and through those years I was completely deceived by the enemy um I
got so deep into the old hole i learned everything i had opened up a witchcraft shop and when I went into it I didn't go
in like I always tell people this like I didn't go in like oh I'm going to work with demons like literally it wasn't
like that i was completely deceived i went in with the lies of um you know that you'll find healing and personal
power um coming from a lot of trauma so it started off what looked innocent and
then um the more doors that I opened up um the darker my interest had become as
the the demons began to take a hold basically um my personality changed so I
had opened up a witchcraft shop um it was mostly online and then I started doing popups in person and I became
involved in like an oult community basically um so what was that like the witchcraft shop and the popups like was
it giving readings or what was it yeah so
there were a lot of people in the community some people did readings but I had more like I made things with my hands so like I um would sell like um
spell jars i would sell like um smudge sticks um what's that um it's like
supposed to clear negative energy u which is silly now because no
it's just opening doors and like now I know these things but at that time I really I was so deceived that I believe
those things and I was like "Wow you know I'm helping people with my shop." Like I was just completely deceived and
um one of my popular things was witch bells that was supposed to like ward off like evil spirits which is so like now
looking back like I was you know I became filled with them you know and um
so that's what happened basically um my shop exploded and I now know it was because the enemy you know was using me
to to lead people astray i would have people come to the popups for my shop and sometimes they would bring their
friends and their friends would wear like cross necklaces um so I knew you know that they were um
you know they were brought there and the the enemy was just all around that place you know um so many people they thought
they were speaking to like spirit guides all of it was demons some people thought they were working with angels like just
all this stuff and um like now that I know this because at that time I was so
deceived that if someone told me you know all that you're doing is demonic i would have been like "Oh you're so close-minded and you don't understand."
And so what happened was um yeah my shop exploded i actually ended up getting a
lot of attacks the more the deeper I got in more attacks started happening i had
um other practitioners at the time attacking me um they were doing like illegal like um like astral projection
type attacks basically so like illegal access in the spirit realm and um I was
giving more and more access to to demons um basically I had encountered beings
and um and you know they were all demons and um they were like oh we're going to
teach you um like how to like we'll do your bidding you know and um once that
happened everything changed um once I was like okay um they started little by little taking
um like my personality became so dark that I became like obsessed with the demonic i would see demons and
everything um just like I was like like it was just drawing me and I thought it
was me um so I didn't know what it was the pua
so I thought every thought that I had was mine so eventually I started setting
up like um like obviously it was all demonic but I went into like demonology basically and when you said we'll do do
bidding for you what can you explain what that means yeah yeah i'm always like cuz it's like so dark that I'm like
I don't know what is okay to say but um so in that old cult community they
believed in um familiars um and they were supposed to be like like a lot of people were like oh I have a familiar
cat you know familiar yeah like familiar and it's interesting because you know like familiar spirits but um in that
community they they thought that they were um beings that would help the witch
that followed the bloodline to help those witches Because actually in my there was a lot of generational stuff from my mom's side um apparently one of
like my mom's ancestors had opened up a door to witchcraft which is why and I know now
that's why there was so much from my mom's side because even before I had lost control of my body when I was a kid
I was constantly being tormented like I could actually see them in my house where I grew up um like so much sleep
paralysis so I grew up with constant torment so the familiar when I
encountered that being um so the familiar is a demon but they don't call
it a demon in the occult community they just say familiar they say it's a spirit that supposedly like teaches and helps
you teaches and helps you with the the witchcraft basically so that particular
you like access powers or you said something with the bloodline yes yeah so they were when I encountered that being
um you know it started speaking and this is like not in the physical this is like um like I would see like vision they
would speak in different ways to me like in my mind or um like showing me things and to get to that place I had to
get into like a kind of like a trance basically and that's how they would speak um where sometimes I would make
like a certain drink um like just you know it was like oil cold stuff um so that's why I'm like You know I don't
want to reveal too much about that but the being would speak to me we're exposing oh yeah that's exposing because
the devil hides yeah that is true you know so it's important we expose okay
yeah so um so yeah I would make like specific brews with different herbs and they would guide me and I at that time I
was like "Oh wow i'm very intuitive." No it was the the demons now I know were the ones who were revealing that
information to me so I I was doing like for the other witches in that community
they specialized in specific different things some of them went in completely like they were Satanists you know but
there were others who thought they were white witches there were some who thought they were light workers and their table setups like you would see
them wearing all white they would have like angel statues they would have like
even like cross necklaces that they were selling so when the people would come in you see that and you're like "Oh that
looks light." Yeah you know and they're like "Oh everything's love." And um they would say things like "Oh Jesus was a
light worker you know he's teaching love." So completely just teaching this wrong information they were saying they
were with Jesus or they believed in some of them yeah so there were actually people who call themselves Christian witches
which is you can't put those two together but they were really convinced and they had like altars like with
statues of Jesus and like um rosaries and there were some people once
again they thought they were working with angels like um the Archangel Michael like and it was all over Tik Tok
like they were teaching people how to work with angels like no they're demons disguising them themselves as angels
they're demons disguising themselves as your dead um grandma like literally and they were like "Oh you know my" Some of
them were like "Oh my my friend died and she comes to visit me." No that's a demon you know but they really believed
it so and in the occult community some would would they kind of get together at
events or something and it'd be like Satanists like openly Satanists and then
like light witches they were all together yeah so you would have like Did they kind of respect each other yeah
they weren't like "Oh the the light witches weren't like oh you're a Satanist you're bad."
No huh yeah because the demons they they knew and um they were all together so
the Satanists were they like saying like "We're Satanists and we serve the devil." Like were they openly saying that community they were so open like
there were certain pop-ups where they would dress up as like demons and they would bring like a huge like I remember
one particular vendor uh he would come and he would bring like a huge like pop-up thing with like Satan and he
would sell like stickers that were very vulgar and he would actually do like do you want to be baptized in the name of
Satan kind of thing so he would actually people would come and be like yeah you know I want to give my life to him and
so it was really dark now when I look back it just as soon as you would enter those specific pop-ups the air became so
thick and heavy they were like "Oh do you feel that?" Like it's because of all
the rituals that are being done here like it was so just out in the open and people would come like just flocking to
these events there was a large one in LA that I would do all the time because all the the um people that organized they
they knew my shop so they wanted me there and it was just like it felt like some stuff was revealed to me
as I was um when I lost control for example that there were actually like huge like principalities over the the
oult community like they were on like kind of like over them and then they would send smaller ones like um to the
particular witches and they all communicated with each other like almost like a web like so all the demons
working together and like one thing that I learned was that there there was so much paranoia in that community they're
like "Oh this witch is sending me something or the evil eye stuff." And it was actually the demons doing that and
they would the demons would kind of whisper in their ears they thought they were their their gods their goddesses dietes spirit guides they're like "Oh um
they would be like whispering in their mind like "Oh this witch is trying to send you something you have to send something back." So almost like
puppeteering the the witches and they would just all attack each other like I
never forget people's shops were being burned down like accidentally like just their cats just being killed in fires i
remember there was a coven and that coven every time they would come in that pop-up community I would just start
trembling because you could just feel the demonic energy um and one of their faces was
completely burned and it was an accidental fire because when that's what happens um what the enemy gives you
whether it's money whatever it is success whatever it is um he takes he takes it and then he takes more like
it's never enough um so many people transactional yeah definitely it's like
he gives you a little bit but then you have to pay Yeah in a demonic way not in
a Yeah like those people good sacrificing way oh no yeah no like that
he steals kills and destroys when he gives you something absolutely he always
takes more whatever he gave you like if he gives you a penny you're like "Oh that's a shiny penny." You know like
money for example like my shop was doing well for example and I was like "Oh wow." And I would say things um I would
say like "Thank you universe." Like you know the prince of the air um so that
was another thing that was revealed to me later that I didn't know like people there would say like "Oh we think source
we don't call him God we say source or um universe things like that." And
everything it was revealed to me that everything there is a perversion of um
of God's principles that you mention a lot um it's a complete perversion like
um like all the witchcraft everything um but yeah I was um Were the Satanists um
open about their work because Satanists and witches well not light witches but
like like true witches and Satanists they know what they're doing they know
they take orders from the devil and they send demons to people so were the the
Satanists that were openly Satanists were they open about their work or they were just open that they were Satanists
and they they hid their work they wouldn't openly speak about it like I'm sure with each other they probably did
but like usually when I was in that community because I thought I was like
helping people um I would try to stay away from them a little bit because I could feel that there were so many
around them and I just it would give me like pain around my neck wow or um my
heart would just start beating really like my physical body would have a reaction where it felt like pain wow and
you could just see like for example one time I was um I was at a popup and there
was one particular and you could tell that she worked with the fallen because she was selling things that had to do with the fallen but she was very open
about it you know like um being more on like the dark dark dark side the fallen angels yeah so she would sell like Yeah
absolutely yeah I just Yeah that's very much so yes so she would sell like their sigils and those were things that you
would um use to summon them basically if you were to open an altar you would put the sigils there and do like your
rituals i remember one time I was next to them and I could just feel like
something you know and I was uncomfortable and then like just stuff from my table just fell and broke like
kind of like that you know um so yeah that's what that community was like and it just expanded like when
I left because when I lost control I I knew I had to close everything down i threw everything away when you lost
control so you lost control of your body so you were were pretty much aware that
you were oppressed severely oppressed with demons yeah I knew because of
um like when I became so dark so when I first got in I was like "Oh you know um
love and light." Kind of like deceived by the the light magic and then I started going into like green magic
which is working with more like herbs then I was like "Oh well maybe I'm just a gray witch which is light and dark."
And then I just became a dark and then I It's just It was a progression then I was like "No actually I work with the Fallen now." And I had set up So you
knowingly then like went to the dark dark side yeah yeah i was being influenced so much i remember just
hearing their names like it was like a whisper in my mind and then I would became so like I need to look them up i
need to read everything I can about the names of the demons the name Yeah the fallen the demons um so I would um look
them up because I kept it kept repeating in my head um specific names that the demons um were giving me in my mind that
I had to look up and I would look them up and it was almost like this weird like drawn like I I felt obsessed in a
weird way it was completely demonic obviously you know unnatural like pull
to it so I started reading on them and then I that's when I set up um the the
altars their their specific demonic altars and um and I was doing things
that I should not have done um where I I gave so much power to the
enemy you gave so much what so much power to the enemy
um like it was just really like dark stuff um and like they were telling me to like
say out loud um which is now interesting because you know we declare right we declare life they were um telling me to
say out loud say that you belong to this particular demon this particular Wow they were outing you to influencing you
to make covenants yeah absolutely say that you belong to the Say it out loud they would tell me say it out loud again
and at one point the power of life and death is in the power of your tongue absolutely yeah I remember that i
remember that yeah they were saying "Okay say it out loud now." And his name the spec the specific demon say it out
loud and um um and
um yeah they they started abusing me um like um just as like a warning you know they
started like physically um like um touching me and abusing me and um
then I realized I started smiling and making expressions that were not my own i remember it was very strange and I
thought wow I became really dark like what is this i thought it was me because when you sm you like you're used to your
expressions being your own and at that point I felt like I was like breathing in like
and there was like heat all around me i could feel it tangibly like fire but it
was like burning like my skin like um and I remember speaking out loud
thinking it was me i thought it was me saying like that feels so good like just
breathing in like the heat that was burning me and um and then I remember
the night that I fully lost control um oh before this actually I had
gone to the the last popup I went to and that time I didn't realized I didn't realize that I was
already possessed at that time and I remember um sorry it's so long i'm like
before that even I had seen in the spirit realm a dragon and um in that
community they didn't say like oh the dragon's satan they didn't tell you that they said oh wow if you encounter a
dragon that's a huge honor they would say they would say um like those you
have to rever him and all of this so when I saw that being um in the spirit
realm it was an enormous black dragon with red eyes just like right in front of me it was huge and um I was it called
me like kin which meant family something in my my family and I was told that I
had set up an altar for this being and at that point I was already like I was already gone i was like okay so I set up
you know I got the statue and I um you know I I gave it blood that was
the blood oath that on my first deliverance um was broken and blood oath oh did you
put like your blood yeah yeah I was supposed to they were like leading me to do that the demons were like speaking to you yeah and at that point not audibly
but No like in like really loud like your like thoughts yes yes and they said
take what like cut your finger or something yeah like give blood basically so I like did a pin needle and
supposedly because I was already so like I just want to say that I was being so heavily influenced you know like it's
not like in the beginning if if all of that had happened in the beginning I would have been like "Oh well this is wild." Like I'm you know I'm out but
already at that point I was so gone that for me it's so wild that I just went
through with it like I was like "Okay." like and I gave blood and I remember
them laughing like "Oh that's that's not a lot of blood that you're giving." Wow and um And what did you do with the blood i put it on the statue and after I
did that what was a statue a statue of It was a statue of a dragon oh of a dragon but that was another thing that I had done with the familiar i I was
guided to make an actual idol out of clay and um so many detail so it's kind
of like you built an idol to the devil yeah it was um the familiar looked like a goat man with no face so he had no
face it was just charred black and he had a bunch like the horns and when I made the idol it was
literally like they were working through my hands like I was literally being guided to make to paint everything how
he wanted it with the the long claws and everything and when I lost control of my
body I could not go near it because they knew that I me that I wanted to destroy
it and so they would not let me go near it um so with the dragon statue um that
altar um and at that time I didn't know it was Satan like literally it was right there and now I know this but at that
time um they told me "Yeah you know you're going to be like so protected now
no demon's going to like it was just so wild no witch is going to come after you." and you're going to have so much
power and um so what happened was I was such a lie they're like "Witches you're
going to do this to get power so that witches don't send you curses but
they're on the same team as the witches." Yep they are w They It's all the Wow all their vessels yeah
absolutely cuz that's how they would see us as vessels basically and at that time I didn't know it they told me "Wow you
have control over these demons." And they were like feeding me like these nasty seeds you know um like in my
heart and um so um yeah with the dragon s I was
also instructed to make a necklace with certain stones and it was a choker it had to be a choker and so I remember
that last popup I did I wore the choker and at that point when I put it on it
felt like something happened like a shift in my my personal how I used to feel like that's me it was like shift in
energy was very different so I went to that popup different and um I remember
the witch that had hurt me in the spirit realm um she came up to my table and she looked in my eyes and she started
trembling and they told me "See I told you look how scared she is look how
powerful you are." Um it was all set up and I was like "Oh wow." But then
that's when I had lost control after that after that last popup because I had given so much like here you go you know
so for covenants you spoke words yes and this is all led by demons you spoke words and this is having to do in the
Bible of the life and death holds the p the power of life and death is in your tongues so that's that means that this
is a spiritual principle for both the kingdom of God and the kingdom of darkness so there is so much power when
we declare God's word and life things happen we partner with God to bring life
we partner with God for his will to be done for works of the devil to be destroyed like when you use your
authority and speak aloud you demonic spirit must go when you speak be healed
when you speak receive peace receive joy things happen miracles happen but the
devil as you mentioned in the beginning you learned all of these principles you learned the devil you'd learned a lot of
these principles in the way in the demonic way that was a twisted way so so
back to the I just want to go over all the covenants that you made that the demons led you to make yeah because this
is powerful i know eyes are being opened up because this is why one of the big reasons I wrote the book Unlock Your
Deliverance is because there's all these complexities in the spiritual realm that many people are not aware of they they
have to renounce certain covenants in order to find their complete freedom it's not as easy as just renouncing one
thing or uh just renouncing simply I renounce that I was involved with witchcraft but you specific you have to
renounce the covenants it's not as simple as just a servant of God commanding the demon to go there are
different keys needed to unlock deliverance and for example these covenants were like
different chains around you like the the speaking the words of death was one
chain the blood covenant was another chain and then also the covenant that
was made by you making this um necklace yeah and also the um the
idol too the and making the idol so now we have that's like four different covenants right and then there was
another one too I remember where because they were so sneaky and crafty with
their decept um deceitfulness because I I had seen firsthand wow the devil's
really sneaky so they would tell me um because the familiar all of a sudden started
attacking more and um I was reading like the familiar is not supposed to do that
you know they're supposed to do what you want and so I was like okay so the idea that I got and it wasn't mine it was
demon once again influencing was that I had to write down now agreement so I
literally wrote down a covenant like literally it was such deceit where I was
saying oh um this this is our agreement this is how it's supposed to be and of
course you know I was not protected by that because it was just like they took that as like another like oh cool let's
just add it to our list of um of covenants that we have against you now kind of thing to hold you um hostage um
and so um but yeah um I ended up that LA that night basically where I realized I
was gone and what I what I mean by that is that um they took control over my
body so I remember I was actually thrown to the ground i was sitting in my chair
and I was physically like I was pushed onto the ground and I was felt like I
was being choked and I could see in the spirit that they were so many and they were um choking me but because they
could they could only do that because it was like they had me you know I had swn so much into the devil's
kingdom um so I just want to put that out there obviously you know when you're fully surrendered you're protected but
like at that point because all the witchcraft all the agreements they had against me um I was felt like I was
being choked on the ground and um I was like "Oh wow." I felt so powerless in
that moment and um and then yeah something happened and they they started speaking out of me and I was like
"What's going on?" And they were like "Wow you're channeling like you can channel spirits you should become a
psychic now you should start they were trying to lead me into a different way now wow but something was off and I knew
like no like something's really wrong and then in that moment
um I started seeing um like it was the visions became too frequent all of a
sudden where um so they're like speaking out of me and moving my body and I I
started seeing them and they were telling me like you need to renounce your your baptism when you were when you
were a child for some reason that was so important to them so you were baptized as a Christian when you were a child
yeah I was a Well my dad um he was actually Catholic but yeah I was baptized and they told me "I want you to
renounce that." Wow and I instantly felt something inside of me saying no
and that's when the battle started they knew something was
happening i started getting images of crosses in my head
wow jesus i started preachers started coming up to me on the street telling me
can I pray for you wow i started receiving mail about Jesus
um Jesus pursuing you and hallelujah people would come to my
door like just random neighbors like do you want to come to my church and at that point because they were like it was
like I felt their anger like they knew that Jesus was pursuing me wow and so
that's why they tried so like adamantly like renounce your baptism and I want they were telling me like um we're going
to do a ritual in the spirit and I we're going to do and they called it a hellfire baptism that's what they called
it and I could see the sword that they had and they were going to do something in the spirit realm and I said no I'm
not doing that and um and so because you said no they couldn't do it no they
could not they were trying to trick me they were saying "We're going to in your sleep you know we're going to find you." And the They were saying like all these
things to try and scare me and I demons cannot do anything unless
we give them authority and this is before you were a believer
in Jesus yeah so I So you were baptized but you didn't you weren't really a believer yeah i was um because I had
experienced oppression since I was a kid so um like I could just see how the enemy was trying to work through my mom
for example um my dad he's always loved Jesus he was the one who um taught me
how to pray as a child he taught me about Jesus he brought me to church but because I was
being tormented I would see them and I thought in my head as a kid how can how
can he allow me to get hurt like um doesn't he love me like I
didn't know his love at that time and um then my parents got divorced and um that
was like I was eight so I got really depressed and after that um and like now I see this was all oppression but um I
would go in my room and I would grab blankets and put them on all the windows so I was in complete
darkness and um so I walked away from from Jesus because I only knew him from
a religious perspective yes i I you know I saw religion as like oh you know the
Catholic church like oh so many rules and condemnation and
um you know and I I didn't know his love like his that revelation of his love
that happened when I lost you know control of my body and he I he like I
encountered him basically for the first time and those months because that was
the end of 2023 when I lost control of my body and they were just moving through me speaking through me i lost
some time because I felt like I was in and out of consciousness and I didn't
know what was happening during that time i just know that I would come back and
you know they were moving and like speaking through me and
um like just threatening me telling me that um that I had to die and that I
needed to do it you know it had to be me to do it so like they would for example take control of my body and they would
grab like a knife and say like come on just do it like really hard because my my body would get so stiff like it was
so stiff when they would take over and they all had different postures so they would make themselves my body in their
postures whatever it was like my hands would go like this or their backs some
of them were on all fours they would make me crawl and they would make the most inhumane sounds that I cannot make
and my expressions would get wrinkles that I cannot not make like it was all supernatural and
um so basically um my body would get so stiff and um they would grab the knife
yeah so they would grab the knife and say come on do it just like stab yourself with it and I would say no and
at that point because I knew that Jesus was pursuing me it was like this knowing that
um like that he was
there like he saw everything I was going through and like I knew that I did it to
myself and somehow he still didn't let me go
i felt his love and like like how I'd explained it
before i realized suddenly it was like he removed this blindfold that I had
on and I saw I never hated God i didn't know I was love and he is
love and it's the most beautiful thing
nothing in this world
it was like I suddenly felt something happening in my heart literally like it
was melting something like a layer that was on top oh I'm so glad I brought that praise
God it was like he was melting this layer that was over my heart of like
bitterness and pain from trauma all the lies were being like
plucked like all of a sudden it was like this question why do you hate God and all of a sudden the random stuff that I
that I had thought before you know the religion thing boom gone oh um you know
the wars and the all of just boom boom being plucked away and I my eyes opened
up and I was like I realized that he is the truth it was just like in a moment I
realized my whole life I like I was deceived and I was like I have to I have
to seek Jesus like it was just this knowing in my heart and the demons were like just like no like yelling through
me they fell oh they were just throwing this fit you know because my eyes opened up and they couldn't stop
it and so I was like I have to seek Jesus and that's when I was like okay
like I I didn't even know how to pray at that time because I hadn't prayed in so long and I prayed and I asked him for
help and I just felt you know at that time there was so much like guilt and shame because I knew
that I got myself in that mess and um it didn't matter like his love was there
and so I started feeling like the pool I need to read the Bible and little by little um because in the beginning when
I had first lost control it was like full body like you know like really
stiff like literally the people around me were like what's going on with you
you know um but um he started bringing me forward
like I started realizing all the lies were being exposed like it was almost like he was revealing it to me and
saying that's not you that's this demon and um so yeah I got my Bible my
first Bible and I started reading and I Oh I want to mention this too because this for me like was just Jesus i used
to listen to a lot of um secular music and like a lot of like sensual type
music um when I got into my car after I threw everything cuz I threw all the
altars away everything except um for those specific idols i couldn't even go near them until my deliverance sessions
for specific things but I threw everything away and I felt like he was there you know and I got in my car and
all of my radio stations like this is only Jesus were all worship stations
they were all Christian music they were all um if it wasn't Christian music it was um a preacher speaking or a pastor
and I was like "What is going on this is supernatural." I was like "What?" And I
remember I would listen to it because I felt like that guiding suddenly like I need to listen to this and then that
other I felt them like no you know like almost like trying to make me repelled kind of thing and I was like no I'm
going to listen to it so I started listening and I tried singing along and I began to encounter him in the
lyrics and it was like he was speaking through the music how much he
loved me
and like that he had never abandoned me actually
wow you just say I didn't know him and I walked away and I remembered when that
happened when I had said yes to the new age and you
quote and he just you know he didn't care he was there so little by little
and I had this feeling like it was just supernatural like like I'm going to help
you because I'm mean I thought I was going to
die when they were showing me where I was going i saw it i saw the demons the
serpents everything the fire hell the different beings i saw a cave of
fire and there was an enormous demon and he was made of fire and they were showing me that he had me in his hand
and he was like like this is candy holding me like look this is you and you're like candy in my hand like I have
you saw I could hear the music and the music would make my soul hurt the music
of hell it was like the worst music that gave
you a pain like that you can't describe it was like pure agony it felt like your
soul was something wrong wow and I would hear the the
cries so I and like this the dark stone you know
the brimstone i could see all types of demons and they were showing me like this is where you're going to go so for
me I thought how am I going to make it out alive what did I
do but Jesus gave me peace even
then and I would put on the praise music and I would sing to him even though they would take over my body they would make
my neck move so hard that it hurt they would abuse me and on
but I was still sick because I felt him say was going to be
okay only Jesus can do that anyone else I think they would have hurt
themselves and that's what they wanted but no he gave me strength he
gave me so much strength to survive
that and to throw everything that I had to throw because sometimes I would want to throw something they'd be like holding like no no no throw away the
demonic Yeah altars and objects everything yeah i remember I had I didn't realize I had I was collecting a
lot of stuff related to like death too like I had um bones I had artwork and I
had to rip them all up everything and it was like I would grab it and like supernaturally just my hands would go
like this wow like they did not want me like just boom really hard and I would
rip it up and they would just get so mad like sometimes they would stomp you know they would start
stomping they would curse at me they would take me to the mirror just to taunt me and just speak
through me um and I would just feel like a passenger in my own body watching as
they're speaking at me saying how much they enjoyed hurting me and how they were going to torture
me and I But Jesus gave me strength he was there and I began to encounter him
more and more and the more I encountered him the more my heart desired him so
much it was like I was in this prison and I could see him wow i would go to the park
and I would see the flowers growing and they were reaching for the sun and I felt like Jesus that's how I feel i want
to reach you but I can't grow fast enough and he was the warmth and love
that I had wanted my whole life with all the trouble and everything it was
you hallelujah hallelujah and then you started seeking deliverance
did you What happened next so after encountering him and um you know seeing
his love I um you know I had gone and I was looking for help but they I went to
two different deliverance ministers and and as soon as I went in it was this
feeling that they were just mocking the whole time they took over and they were like
intimidating they were laughing and because they were men they were saying such vulgar things because I was a woman
and just like making fun of them and trying to scare them and so when I left I felt the same exact way and they were
saying demons were saying vulgar things to the pastors trying to cast demons out
because you were a woman and they were men so they were doing this perverted sexual type thing like blasphemies all
types of just vulgar things and they would say like "Oh she's going to rot in hell." They would say like
um just all this stuff they would say and um so I would leave and I remember
leaving the the first one because I went to two um it was two different ones and
it was the same thing they were just making fun one of them was younger so they were like "Oh okay." And they were
like really just glaring just glaring through me like trying to scare him when
I left um because they saw I was serious about seeking help i remember one of them took because my at that point my
body was like fully possessed so I could see them like my eyes were flickering around and at that point it looked like
I was looking through like a long tunnel and I don't know if you've seen when it's really hot like there's like
heat waves like in the the far distance that's what it looked like like I was looking through a long tunnel and it was
almost like a dream and I could hear him like they were speaking like like do we
run into the street like for me to get hit by a car wow like they did so many
things like that but Jesus never let any of that happen always you know one time
I was driving on the freeway and my foot just went all the way down wow and same
thing like it didn't happen obviously you know Jesus was protecting me wow um so those were Yeah the two deliverance
ministers and then I um Did you find deliverance after going after those two
no I didn't go and I was like you know I was praying for help and then he led me to your page on Instagram and it just
popped up um it was probably a deliverance video i mean I don't remember which one it was and um they
were manifesting and I knew like just inside like this is where I need to go like this is where you need to go and I
thought you were going to be far away um but no you were right here in LA and you
know I live in Long Beach so super close but I didn't go in person for months
because it was this like it was my will against theirs and it was fighting it
was literally like I would get so much fear like my stomach didn't feel like it
was this horrible feeling of wanting to run away i would like start itching my neck um and like they would start
shaking my head like really hard like no like you're not going there and all of this but I remember I had an experience
um um it was actually in Topena this was the Saturday before the Sunday I went so
it was already November and um it just felt like more of them were like coming
in i went into a shop around there and I could feel that shop had a lot of like
demonic energy everywhere and I went into a specific room and my head went like boom wow and
then um they were speaking in tongues and I was just watching what's going on
and they're going like this with their hand like with my hand like So you started speaking demonic tongues they
demonstr you and they started doing this with your hands yeah they would always like speak in different like languages
sometimes like they would say like Latin words and other times it was like just like old languages that I could never
understand um or tongues things like that but in this specific instance um or
circumstance it was like it felt like a new one because suddenly he was looking at my hands like like oh wow like and he
was like speaking out loud like wow like like so excited that he was in my body and I was like this is too much like um
I was like that's I can't I can't like this is too much um because I was trying
to survive at that point i was I would um at home they would take over all the
time every day every day they would take over um if I would listen to certain
types of music they would instantly take over and start doing things like with my hands like they were acting like they
were opening stuff up in my home like literally like in the spirit realm but in the physical with my hands if that
makes sense it was really weird to to witness and they would speak in a tongue while while doing this so every day it
was like at home I would suffer and I would go out and I would try to hide the expressions so I would just try to act
normal um but their expressions would still come out if um someone was like
hurting or something they would see something that was evil they would just start laughing and their laughs would come out but um so yeah anyways that you
know that sun Saturday before Sunday um that's what happened i felt new ones were basically entering and I was like I
can't like I can't live like this this is too much and I I prayed and like
Jesus please give me strength because I need it like I I can't describe the
feeling it was like I like I wanted to go but like they were pulling me like no
it was such a fight to come where our power was it was such a fight and they
didn't want you to come yeah and they knew why so I I finally I was decided
okay I'm going tomorrow like I just I decided I'm going tomorrow and um as I'm going in the car I'm feeling everything
like I know what's going to that they're going to manifest because I if I see it at home then of course it's going to you
know um so yeah I went and like I mentioned as soon as I I got near the church you
know where the anointing is um the building where it was um my body started bouncing like in a
supernatural way and um but I felt his warmth with me it was like he was
holding my hand or like he was like hugging me with warmth like like I'm here it's okay and that gave me so much
courage to just keep going in i went in i didn't run away or anything and then like I mentioned everyone was
so kind they they saw me manifesting and they with such love you know they told me you know you're going to be set free
it's going to be okay you know and that just like like I needed that you know
because I was going in feeling my fear and then also feeling theirs so it was just a lot of fear at that time and then
yeah um like id mentioned it shows how important the whole body is that the the
body of Christ at 5F church were vessels of God to demolish fear in you yeah
perfect love yeah cast out fear yeah that's what it was yeah it was the love that was radiating through everyone and
their their faces just radiating um it gave me such comfort
so um even though my body was so uncomfortable you know and then I I sat down and that first deliverance session
I couldn't even listen to the sermon because of how bad they were manifesting that they knew um the power of God was
there and then worship started and I just I never forget that specific one
just falling to like his knees my knees fell you know on the ground and he was like "No." like like a scene out of a
movie basically like it was like no and I could feel that it was pain that they were experiencing like in the
presence of the anointing they were feeling like pain like it was like waves that would just hit and so it was like
the fire of God coming upon them yeah yeah and they that's why I was feeling
that but it was there it was like their pain and um then yeah when deliverance
came that um you know Tanya and Felicia they came and they were both next to me
you know thank you Jesus enough your time is up tormenting her
now i break every demonic covenant off her life now i break every generational
curse now every curse made upon her life curse of death I break it now in Jesus'

hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
hallelujah hallelujah praise God and um immediately boom I was out
like I could hear one of them was took over my tongue and was just speaking but then after that um I was I blacked out
until you would call me forward and then that's when I would come from wherever I was
and I I saw like I said at that time I was on my knees and I I looked into your
eyes and I I saw Jesus like I it was like this glow and I just knew it was
Jesus and that's why I said please help me Jesus because I knew Jesus was right
there and um and then yeah that that deliverance happened and so many of them were cast
out so I went home and I was able to throw away things and I remember when I finally grabbed that idol and I put it
in a box and I went to the garage and I went boom i threw it on the ground and I threw it
away it was like a huge chain like like I was like "Wow like I can throw this
away." Like it was like a layer of freedom that came because before I couldn't even go near it like it was
like they were like no like this fear that they had don't go near it you know
and so when I got home and I could do that it was beautiful like I was like
wow so I had testified that I was coming every weekend like I mentioned but then
the enemy came and was like no you know look at how you manifested and oh
everyone was looking at you and like just coming with all of this you know
lies basically that I shouldn't go back and even trying to work through people around me who are really close to me
saying "Oh you should tell them you should email them and tell them to remove your testimony." Yeah working
through people around me and I'm like "Why you weren't in it like why does it bother you?" But I knew that you know it
was the devil so um trying so hard and um I knew
like Jesus wanted me there it was this knowing of I need to be obedient and I need to go that's where he wants me and
um so at first I was only like I think it was maybe like 3 weeks that I didn't go back i was watching online i was
trying like well maybe if I just watch online you know and but no I knew I had to go so I came back and then that's
when I was just like all right you know like have your way and like however I manifest you know like have your way and
I went and then during the service that's when you were like you know Jesus is freeing you and I my body started
trembling like it was like trembling they were like "No." It was so
powerful because I had more awareness this time and I always I mentioned it before but it was like this cloud around
you and the cloud was tangible it was the presence of God so powerfully all
around you because I felt their their like strategy there was like okay we're
going to try to like intimidate her and like shake her faith or something like they were saying these vile things and I
could hear it and I was like wow like that's but then I saw the cloud and then
suddenly I was like everything's okay like Jesus is right there and you know
you were talking so the demons were saying they were like saying in your mind we're going to intimidate they It
was the feeling like I could feel their emotions they wanted to intimidate me you could feel they were like "Oh we're
going to try." Yeah they tried i could They're liars yeah they were trying so
hard and you know you were so But yeah so they didn't have a chance
but um renouncing was so important thank you Jesus enough she can enough

Jesus thank you Lord hallelujah hallelujah and the anointing
is going to continue to work in her like a spiritual surgery jesus is working in her like a spiritual surgery now taking
out everything thank you Jesus hallelujah
and immediately everything that I had to announce just started coming in my mind like a flood basically i'm just saying
everything you know even things where I was like oh wow you know um like one of
them was seducing spirits and I was like I in the in the cool I didn't work with
like seduc I didn't know it was something that probably came like from
abuse that I had had before something like that and I I renounced it so the Holy Spirit just gave you this is what
you need to announce in that moment yes yeah everything was just flooding out even as I'm falling on the ground boom
boom yoga everything you know can python you know divination everything was just
boom boom boom and it was like they had nothing to hold on you know and I renounced the fallen i had to say um
their specific names and I never forget when I said the the main one that I had
an altar for and when I said his name he it was like he finished his name for me as he was leaving yeah so it was like
well like I wasn't expecting that to happen and then um I just also want to
mention that I forgotten before but in the presence of the anointing when you were right in front of me and I saw the
cloud it also felt like ocean waves i always forgot to mention that that the anointing was so powerful that if you
even look back at my second deliverance as like they were making my body go like this like because it was so powerful it
was hitting like waves so I just wanted to bring that up that I could feel it like my body would get like weak in
certain points because the anointing was hitting like waves literally and it was too much like it was like they were
being tortured you know they were just trying to hold on um wow and so as I was
renouncing everything they had to go and then obviously you you released um the anointing and they were being burned
like I could hear I mean you could hear it in their yells you know it didn't sound like pleasant yells as they were leaving but also I could hear it in my
mind it burns it burns and they were like trying to back away in my body you can actually see it in deliverance where
they're like going like this and so they're leaving and then another one's in the front and then they're leaving and it was like that like literally boom
boom boom and they were all different yells just boom boom leaving leaving so so many left that day and
even as I got home I felt like I was feeling lighter now you know less manifestations and then finally that
last one it was so beautiful because I always had it in my heart i knew it was going to be in layers and I would always
say in God's perfect timing and it was um the last service of the the year that
I was like that was really beautiful that he did that because I got to start this new year with him you know can you
help her come help her come allow her to come thank you
Jesus thank you Jesus god's freeing you more right now hun do you want to
renounce anything more now hun you attack me when I read the Bible or pray they put perversion and vulgar things
about Jesus in my mind they're constantly attacking i detach you from that now and I declare every religious
spirit every spirit trying to keep you from God's love from spending time with him from reading the word must leave

peacefully from now in Jesus name thank you Lord hallelujah praise God praise
God for bringing more freedom to her praise God thank you Jesus thank you
Jesus hallelujah hallelujah so that last um service where I had my
deliverance you you mentioned the spirits that came in from trauma and that was really important because um
like I said there was so much trauma growing up and um not just with the local community but my teenage years
specific abuse and um you know as a kid too and um so um as soon as you said
that a loud pain yell came out of me it was like all of the the pain that was
inside was somehow leaving like I I just felt it
all and um then that's when you were like okay let her come to the front and um in that moment like I just never
forget because I knew Jesus was there you know I knew he was working through you that it felt like like I was
literally running to Jesus like if I could see him you like physically like I would run to
him and just and that's what it was like i was like if I touched his
feet you wanted to touch his feet yeah but I know you were his vessel so I was like I was running to you you know act
like I felt it was Jesus because you saw Jesus moving through me it was like you
you saw Jesus you weren't like releasing you but Jesus in the spirit i was like I
was running to Jesus like I wasn't seeing you i was seeing Jesus and I
wanted to get down just and I and I surrendered everything in that moment i
didn't care i ran i was like I don't care how I manifest nothing i ran and
everyone around disappeared i didn't It was like it was just me and Jesus in that moment and um you were on the stage
but I just got on my my knees and I put my hands up and um that was the
last deliverance that I had and I went back to my seat and I was receiving more
deliverance i was feeling his love and his mercy as this is all happening like that's why you know in
the photo he's like I'm crying and it's like I remember some people were like "Well you don't look happy." I'm like
"No I'm feeling his love and his mercy." It was overwhelming me it was so beautiful um I went back and I was still
being delivered as you were speaking um and then when the last one left literally like a pitch black scene just
left from my left side so vivid you saw it in my mind yeah in your mind you saw something black pitch black like this
like a shadow just boom and then I felt and then I was like just laying there
for a moment and you that's when you called like you even though I wasn't in front you didn't see me you know Jesus
knows everything it's perfect timing you called for baptism of the Holy Spirit and then I remembered when they talked
about the tongues of fire and like suddenly that verse came to my mind in that moment because it felt like it was
through here and then shot down through my whole body like electric fire and it
was so beautiful and I the like I could feel his love but it was the fear of God
that came over me that I will never it was so beautiful um like just like I
felt so tiny like I felt like a speck of sand and this is my God and so after that I I felt like I could
breathe it was like this I was cleaned from the inside i was completely cleaned like fresh cold water just cleaning
everything inside and um I stood up and I remember I was like just praising him
it was like I was just no longer in the physical anymore i was just praising him and I remember calling him my king and I
was just repeating his name over and over again just dancing and like in that moment I felt like I was in heaven for a
moment and um I knew I was free i remember screaming "I'm free." No one
could hear me cuz it was worship already and I know I was free joy i
came and then I remember I left that you know I left the service and I was like
just filled with the spirit and I remember I remember there was maybe it was a homeless person was out i just
remember going like Jesus is alive he's in there like I was so filled with this
i didn't care and I was like Jesus is alive he's in there you know and it was
so beautiful in that moment I knew I was free but then when I got home the enemy
tried to come with lies and you know this is why it was so like it is so important to be planted and the
teachings and everything like you know to maintain my freedom so important so
vital because the enemy tried to come with lies of oh you're not really free you know like what is that and
especially since I was I had lost control of my body for over a year so I was so used to if I looked in the mirror
I would see something so I would go and like I didn't want to look at myself in the mirror because I didn't want to like
have a you know them make an expression I wouldn't look at myself in the mirror if I felt felt like a sensation like um
sometimes I would feel a sensation that was similar to what I had when I was oppressed and I would be like oh no like one of them must be hiding and then you
mentioned like that's a lot like um the no longer slaves was wow you know no longer slaves message yeah like the the
fake manifestations things like that so you were experiencing fake manifestations you were exper which to explain to to those who are watching or
listening um when you were delivered from demons demons were once within in
they were once within lying to you and oppressing you and influencing you and
controlling you in certain areas when you were set free demons are no longer
inside of you who the sun sets free is free indeed but we are all in a spiritual war every single one of us is
has a war in the mind sometimes where the enemy comes and speaks thoughts and feelings that are not our own even when
you're spiritually mature there can be a time when the enemy plops a thought in your mind that's not yours or in your
dreams that's not yours this is part of being a spiritual being in a spiritual war it's not that you're oppressed by
demons but when people are so used to being oppressed by demons and having demons inwardly the devil can lie and
come in a similar way that seems like the same as when they were oppressed
from within but now it's simply just the devil lying because he's the father of lies so he can lie really well he can
really deceive and trick easily that's why our eyes must be opened up and we must have this equipping to know the
devil's schemes like what April was sharing that's why to maintain your deliverance you have to be planted in a
church that's teaching these things that's really equipping you that carries the anointing that's also why I highly
recommend you read my book The Unlock Your Deliverance because there I spend several chapters teaching you how to
maintain your deliverance revealing these exact schemes of the devil when you know the truth the truth will set
you free but you'll perish with lack of knowledge if you don't have this knowledge so the devil can come and
after you're free and say you're oppressed still and he even can lie and bring a fake
manifestation um because the mind is so powerful so he can literally it's hard to explain but he
can literally try to influence your body to even move in a jerking moment even like muscle memory because you were so
used to that like you said but what you need to do is to is to remember renew
your mind who the sense that's free is free indeed i saw that block thing leave me you know I totally felt that freedom
i know the difference in my life i know the fruits of my life i know that demons are no longer within they're just
outward and when they're outward it's weapons formed against you that cannot prosper if you resist the devil if you
reject his lies and as you do that those lies diminish the fake manifestations
stop because you're not giving him authority to make his allow his lies to
be your reality hallelujah so praise God you had that equipping at 5F Church to
know the devil's schemes or else you would probably still think you were in bondage and be like fake manifesting
today yeah and I I remember um that happened so I was like "Oh no there must
be one hiding." Even though I had literally felt in my spirit I'm free right so I was like um in that moment I
was praying and I remember um and also the maintaining your deliverance the the um playlist that helped so much i wrote
notes and everything like I had to take the equipping so seriously you know but I remember I went for one service and it
was like a fake manifestations and then I was I was convicted about it like no
you're free you know and then that moment I knew okay like that's it I'm free like and you just rejected the lies
reject you would speak aloud and then that would diminish the fake manifestations of lies saying you're not
really free yeah that and also the fake so sometimes I would get like sensation of fear or anxiety yeah and I was like
"Oh no there must be one hiding in my stomach." So I when I had that realization I would just I would like
declare you know that um by his stripes I am healed or like who the sun sets free is free indeed and I would reject
it out loud too like I reject that sensation you know or say it must go things like that and it would diminish
it would just leave and then the later on it's true submit to God resist the devil and he must flee this is a law in
the spiritual realm this is a principle of God if we will just do what the go what the word of God says look at the
life we can live a freedom true freedom an abundant life the devil has no power over us amen yes hallelujah yeah so that
was really important to keep rejecting because the the enemy would try to come in the mind a lot you know and so it was
intense spiritual warfare but your teaching the anointed teachings were like every time I would go it was like I
was you know um like I'd feel in my spirit like it was spiritual food you know that's what I needed for that week
the prophetic um ministry like he would always um there would be something for me like each time and then um even the
the lives during the week would get me through and you know the warfare was intense and I I was like I want to spiritually mature you know like even
though I was like completely new to everything like I like I was like I want to be spiritually mature and I I had to take it very seriously like I knew that
you know the deep bondage that I was in before and the devil was not happy that you know that I was free so I I took it
very seriously like every day watching the teachings staying planted um um and
then um also renewing my mind with the word you know and the the written and
spoken word and also um that we are in the spiritual word like I you know
before every time an attack would come I'm like oh no you know what's going on and then I remembered um you mentioned
in I think it was the maintain your deliverance um that don't be surprised at the fiery trial that has come upon
you And we are in a spiritual war you know nothing to fear nothing to be down about nothing to be confused about we
have the victory we got to be warriors yeah so constantly renewing the mind
constantly when something would come up and that that took effort you know to do that but it was something that I had to
do you know and you saw the fruit of it you saw transformation from putting this the effort this spiritual effort oh yes
finally that was like the the peace and the joy and then I realized like anytime I'm not in that it's the voice of the
enemy trying to come in so when the enemy would try to come in with confusion or um you know lies of shame
or um like anything that was not that peace joy and love that Jesus gives me I'm like "Oh the enemy is trying to
attack right now i have to reject that." And then I would like take it really seriously you know and then um same
thing i would um the enemy would try to a girl i'm proud of you
you are really my spiritual daughter i'm proud of you a real true disciple that
takes the word to heart and applies it hallelujah i'm so proud of you thank you
i want you to um share with share your before and after i know part of the
before we heard a lot about the torment is just them controlling you and bringing you you into so much darkness
and just trying to influence you to go deeper and deeper into darkness but can you just kind of share a list like of
what life was like before and after freedom through Christ and life with
Jesus yeah so before um I was oh like I
would have depression all the time like even my dad he's like you're a new person like you've literally been reborn
i don't recognize you um so I was I was depressed a lot you know um my outlook
on life was very gloomy um I would have like suicidal ideiations like just kind
of like it would come up you know like oh that would be nice um and um like a
lot of intrusive thought a lot of anxiety a lot of fear u paranoia i didn't like putting gas i didn't like
like people were looking at me I would be like are they do they want to hurt me kind of like that you know um the trauma
a lot of trauma um and that would like hold me back because the enemy would try to bring it constantly to my forefront
of the mind the trauma constantly repeating it over and over and over again and I had to um you know I was
freed from that and also when the enemy would try later reject it and then it's gone but um also um the sleep paralysis
um like um it's just it's wild because it's like like I've described it
before i was like I was in complete darkness so life before I wasn't looking around i wasn't enjoying the beautiful
creation that that God made you know um my mind was fixated on death it was
fixated on darkness or like oh feeling feeling bad wanting to be in bed all the
time there was no peace there was no joy i was trying to fill that void that only
Jesus can fill with um buying things i was in a lot of debt i would just buy
things trying to fill like feel a little bit of joy you know i would um hoard
things like I would just start collecting trying to fill something here that only Jesus could and um and yeah it
was um uh there was a lot of pride there too there was um manipulation like in my
um relationships and um I was set free from all of that you know when the the
spirits were leaving and I was like "Oh wow jesus like he revealed that to me that that's what that was that wasn't me it was the spirit." You know it wasn't
your personality it was oppression yeah like they would even smile like I would like get like a smirk that would come
when the manipulation would happen and I realized that's not me you know um like
all of that is gone like like I feel peace like even in the the midst of um
battles you know spiritual warfare you know we're in spiritual war he gives me peace he gives me confidence like all
like I'm testifying for Jesus he gives me such boldness because before I would just try to hide you know and like no
one look at me and like I wouldn't be in front of a camera jesus he gives me boldness and confidence he gives me
courage he strengthens me no matter what I'm going through like I know like with
him I can do anything and um like I feel love like sometimes I'll get little
glimpses where I'll see people and it's like he's almost showing me how he sees
them and I feel this deep love come suddenly and I'm like how
beautiful is your love for us Jesus like that's so
beautiful so my my whole life has changed it's all It's like yesterday I
had this when I was praying this came up where it was like I was a flower in the
dark that was being trampled and he took me out of there and he put me in the
most beautiful garden and he took such good care like just with such love and
tender care feeding me and watering speaking love over me and the garden
like all of his children all the flowers and I think of 5F church all my brothers
and sisters in Christ he saved all of us we all came from different backgrounds and we're in this beautiful
garden now and that's when I go to 5 it's like it's like his kingdom is here
like I feel like I'm a slice of heaven feels like I'm in heaven on earth
like it's in the spirit like I could just feel his presence with us like a cloud over us and it's the most
beautiful thing glory the enemy tried so hard to come with lies oh leave the
church all this stuff and I'm like that's not me i would never do that
wow this is where Jesus is wow it's like
when I see the anointing it's like when I saw the cloud around you I was remembered i was reminded of how um um
they would follow the Israelites would follow the cloud of you know Yes you know when you enter the room you can
you can feel it hallelujah hallelujah
it's so powerful it's like wow what did I do to deserve this that I get to be here for
his revival like what who am I so I just I feel joy now you know joy
excitement for the future that I did not have before before it was like before I wanted to
die and now I'm excited because I know he has beautiful plans for all of us you
know and I just want to be more and more transformed into his image this desire
for him that he's given me in my
heart so yeah hallelujah hallelujah thank you
Jesus hallelujah wow glory to God you know you remind me
so much of Mary Magdalene i always just think of her when I look at you like a modern-day Mary Magdalene
because she was really oppressed by demons by many by several
and she was set free jesus set her free and then she really became a
disciple she truly became a disciple she valued her deliverance she valued what Jesus did
for her she gave her life to him she fell in love with him and lived her life
in obedience to God that was her love to him is is her obedience that's how we
show our love to God the best way that's his love language is obedience and I I'm
so proud of you and I just I really see as a modern day Mary Magdalene because not only were you set free but you
valued your deliverance and you valued the love that Jesus showed you the grace he showed you and you decided to truly
follow him and obey him and truly be a disciple and because you've done that
I've I'm really in awe of the fruits in your life like it's been Was it mid
November when did you come in November which day or end maybe like the 29th or something maybe like like around mid
November yeah okay so that's about 5 months so it's only been 5 months and
from you being so oppressed by many demons only three times coming to 5F
Church and you were completely set free and now you are transformed you are even
spirit quite spiritually mature especially considering the time that you've been truly following Jesus and I
am just so proud of you and you are such a great example for others to follow specifically to value your freedom and
to value what God is releasing his anointing and the teachings the equipping because a lot of people
they're seeking after deliverance but they're not seeking after Jesus who
brings lasting freedommen as you follow his commands who brings abundant life as
you value his word which he is the word there's many people seeking after deliverance but then they get
deliverance and they don't seek after maintaining their deliverance they don't seek after pleasing god so I am proud of
you and this and I'm proud of you because this is an example for the world to see that it's not complicated or
difficult or hard to or or have to take a long time to receive complete
deliverance and even after receiving deliverance though you're in a battle you truly have victory if you will
choose to be a warrior and choose to take it seriously hallelujah i'm so proud of you thank you
Jesus hey you know there was something that I was thinking of as you were speaking something I was reminded of you
know the woman with the issue of blood the Bible says that she tried to be healed in so many different ways no one
could help her and you think about all the oppressed people you know they were Pharisees that were conducting exorcisms
but they wouldn't have had the power of Jesus that destroys the yoke and so they
wouldn't be that successful in casting out demons and um the I I saw the series
The Chosen where I don't know if you've seen it but there's a scene that just came to my mind that you know depicts
what it could have been like where there was this very possessed woman her name
is Mary Magdalene and um they didn't know what to do with her because she was
so possessed by demons and so they call on uh Nicodemus this isn't the chosen
they depict it this way um they call in Nicodemus to try to cast out the demons and he tries and he's unable
to and when when Jesus uh uh attempts to
cast the demons out he doesn't just attempt he's successful he he del he
delivers her from many demons and with ease and quickly and she becomes
completely free and so that is such a parallel to today to the church today
where there are so many people you are not alone there are so many people who are oppressed in this world there are so
many believers who are oppressed there are so many people coming to churches seeking deliverance seeking for help but
they're not receiving it not because love is missing from the ministers but
because the anointing not because theology is missing not because um you
know preachings are missing but the anointing is missing and that is the
only thing that destroys the yoke it's the difference of the ministers without the power of God before Jesus trying to
cast demons out and not being able to and then Jesus doing it with ease and so that literally happened in your life
yeah so I want you to just briefly share a message to leaders in the body of
Christ today and just anyone who feels a call to
ministry who currently does not have the anointing or maybe is not very open to
receiving the anointing what would a message be for them yes um before that I
also wanted to mention because you mentioned the chosen um I saw that first episode with Mary Magdalene and I
remember feeling his presence because um when he called her by name I also they
in the that first episode they had the demons had given her a different name and they had done the same for me so
when he he called her by name um it was so powerful that I related to it so much
because um you know and then you had the prophetic message about my my real name too you know yes so I just wanted to
bring that up that it was so powerful like I had felt his presence when that had happened um but yes um so the
message that I would give is to to really humble to be to humble yourself
that um that you know this is something like every church needs the anointing the
power of God there are so many people who are who are suffering and um what I've noticed because of course I kind of
jumped right in you know I didn't have experience with like religious Pharisees before anything like that you know and I
saw that there's a lot of pride there you know it it doesn't matter how old
you are or you know how much um like Bible knowledge you may have like the anointing is what destroys the yoke and
I am a living testimony of that because I went to other people and the anointing
was not there and the demons were just laughing and mocking you know if people would just come you know with humility
and see that there's something here so beautiful and powerful and um that they
want to receive that too and you know to come under and learn what you can um so that people can be set free like to just
put that aside you know and think of the people who who need help who are
oppressed um that would be my My message is on humility you know obviously I I'm
not in ministry or anything but that's what I see that what I've kind of experienced with like the Pharisees of
today is there's like a lot of pride you know um the anointing is for everybody
it's not to be hoarded it's not to look powerful and important and impressive
and my heart's desire is that ministers and those who desire to minister and
really every believer you we're all called to carry the anointing so my dream my prayer is
that you that leaders of all believers would see this truth that I'm sharing
that the anointing is for you and God has a main way of releasing anointing
and that's through impartation and so the anointing generally doesn't come just it won't come just doing it in
our own way just you know out of pride just wanting to receive it on your own
like crying out to God in your room or something the way to receive anointing
the main way is to humble yourself and learn from those God has poured the
anointing upon and receive impartation from there you know God anoints servants
today just like he anointed Elijah to then release his mantle release
impartation of anointing to Elisha just like Moses released the anointing to
Joshua just like Paul released the anointing to Timothy and his other disciples and so today there are
present- day Elijah's that God has anointed present day Moses's present day
Pauls and he's calling you to be like a Timothy like a Joshua like an Elisha
it's important for you to see these true servants of God that God has anointed with the right heart with pure hearts to
see that they want to release what they have they want you to carry this power
of God that is so precious because we are on one team and they want to see you
i want to see you cast out demons and help people and deliver people like
April in your part of the world or whoever comes to you that God is calling you to to deliver by his power it's so
important that we don't see each other with comparison or jealousy or see people see each other wrongly like as if
this anointing is to look powerful or something i say as one who who by by
God's grace and for his glory he has released the anointing to me and I just
want to give it the Bible says freely you have received freely give i want to give it i want God to be glorified
through your life you ministers out there i I want there to be such amazing
powerful fruit in your ministry i want people like April to come to your church and not have to keep seeking and and
search far and wide to find where is the anointing i want them to come one time and find freedom through you that's my
heart and that's the heart of other true anointed servants of God today and I
pray that if you're a minister out there or any believer that your eyes would open up to see this because God wants to
anoint you god wants to pour his anointing upon you but it will only come through humility through truly having a servant
heart becoming a disciple being open and childlike to be able to learn and
receive and and and know that you don't have all the answers and that you need more or you need more anointing and you
need more revelation hallelujah well April I just
have to push this back so I can shout praises to Jesus
hallelujah jesus hallelujah
praise God jesus God the butt the Bible has come
alive the I mean your testimony i'm just sitting here the whole time in awe i'm
sitting here prophetically seeing millions of people being touched because
they are seeing the Bible come alive we don't just have to watch TV shows to pick the Bible revival is now and we can
see the Bible come alive before us wake up church revival is now revival is now
hallelujah this power of God is available for you this freedom is available for you there's one thing
there's one there's a there's a lot that God has spoken through your testimony today that I know just revelation has
come and faith has been lifted one thing I want to share with with you watching
you know that what you sow you reap and I talk about in my book in my book Unlock Your Deliverance
I talk about how the more you sew into the devil's kingdom uh the more reaping
you have in the in the devil's kingdom and what I mean by that we can we can use your testimony as example you were
actively seeking witchcraft then you started doing witchcraft then you um made covenants that you you spoke things
aloud that the demons wanted you to so every time you were doing that you were sewing and the reaping looked like demon
upon demon upon demon the reaping looked like chain after chain after chain after chain so your case your case of
oppression became more complex didn't mean it was more difficult to be free it
just means that you need more keys it says it here keys to freedom from
demonic oppression you needed more keys for some people the key is simply coming
to where God's power is and that's it they're just a demon just goes they cannot stand the power of God
um but for you you needed to renounce for you you needed to throw away the
altars demonic objects objects that had demons attached to them for you um it
was layers god delivered you in layers sometimes God delivers in layers so he did deliver you it was kind of like he
had several chains and he took a bunch of chains off one time and then he took off a bunch of chains another time and
then he took a bunch of chains off another time he did that but also you partnered with him to use the keys that
he released the keys of the kingdom that I share in this book that I have shared at 5F church that you had received in
the teachings you you he released those keys meaning the revelation this is what you need to do to be free this is your
part you need to play and you use those keys so it's like when you use those keys it's like you're turning the the
lock on the lock that's on the chain and then now the anointing takes it off you
need both you need to do your your part you need to use the keys of the kingdom that God re releases as I've released in
this book as I've released revelation from the Bible what these keys are and you also need God's power
so there's many people out there who are like thinking it's so hard to be set free and and a lot of you honestly you
have already been free especially if you've been where God's power is either online or in person um you know if
you've experienced maybe you've experienced some deliverance but you feel like you have a long ways to go or you feel like there's just one stubborn
demon that might not be leaving honestly a lot of you if you've truly been where God's power is and if you are truly
doing your best to live in obedience to God and being surrendered you don't have to be perfect but that it's it's it's
it's that you are living a life of repentance you are living a life of surrender and obedience if that's what
you're doing then you are most likely completely free but the devil's been
lying to you just as April shared so I know there's going to be a lot of people today that are going to be free from the
devil's lies and be able to now walk in their freedom and walk in abundant life
hallelujah one other thing I want to mention that was um so powerful from your testimony is if you were out there
and you have friends and family members who are far from
God did you hear April's testimony did you hear how much God loved her that he
pursued her he pursued her in supernatural ways all of a sudden all of
a sudden when things when when you were hitting the pit the darkest deep darkest
the the rock bottom right that's when he showed up because you you were just so lost and so gone because the thing is is
he gives free will he gives us free will so when you are far from God he's giving
you free will he's not going overboard pursuing you but sometimes there comes a place where out of his love he rescues
you so there's a lot of people in your life that you are so discouraged that they are far from God and they're not
seeking God you need to trust God that he's going to rescue them that he's going to pursue them whether whether
it's he has to rescue them or they start seeking him and he pursues them pursues
them but he is going to pursue them god loves every single person on this earth he loves you he loves your family
members he loves your friends just as much as he loves April and it was God's amazing love that he pursued her in
these beautiful ways these supernatural ways people just coming up on the street praying for her um you seen crosses in
your your mind suddenly Christian music started playing all these beautiful Jesus hallelujah God you are amazing
this is great love for all of the people on this earth so oh thank you Lord
you've done a lot in this through this testimony Jesus h I'm so excited I'm so
excited I literally see prophetically so many miracles that God has done thank
you Jesus well if you need freedom right now I believe God is going to I know God
is going to come through that screen and deliver you right where you are because his anointing is truly here and no demon
can stay where the anointing is present so if there's something you feel called to renounce right now God may be
speaking to you something you need to renounce speak it now renounce it right
now i detach you from what you are renouncing what you have renounced i break every curse off your life and I
cancel every demonic covenant you have made and I break every word curse that
you've spoken every word of death you have spoken and I declare every spirit of witchcraft every spirit coming from
your past every spirit of trauma every demonic spirit sending lies to you in your mind every spirit of fear and
depression i declare all must go now in Jesus name every spirit of suicidal
thoughts every spirit of death must go now in Jesus' name hallelujah and I
declare to to those of you that have been that that God has just opened up your eyes right now that you truly have
been free but the devil was lying to you saying you were not free i say to you who the sun sets free is free indeed say
right now I am free who the sun sets free is free indeed thank you Jesus for
my freedom and reject the devil's lies right now say I reject this lie saying
that I'm not free yet that I have more demons i reject you devil every lie you
are speaking in my mind hallelujah thank you Jesus i speak
protection and peace over your mind now and that the devil will no longer be able to deceive you or win with his lies
ever again in Jesus' name thank you Jesus i release this anointing to your
friends and family members who are not saved yet and may may this anointing
locate them and may they start to be pulled be gravitated towards Jesus in
Jesus name i speak also to those people out there who desire to carry this
anointing to set others free i release this anointing upon your life may God
start to use you in power in Jesus name thank you Jesus hallelujah hallelujah
thank you Lord i thank you Jesus for what you have done today thank you Jesus

amazing hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus
