About the Author

### **Introduction**

TEN YEARS PRIOR to my writing this, never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined I would be writing a book to help people receive deliverance. A decade ago, I did not even know what deliverance was. I was a believer my whole life. My first memory dates back to age four, when I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior. In my mid-twenties my eyes were opened to the fact that God moves in power today, just as He did in the Gospels and the Acts church. I witnessed healings and demons being cast out of people, and I was baptized in the Holy Spirit.

With my eyes now open to God’s great love, I experienced Him tangibly by His power and was moved to surrender my whole life to Him. That surrender prepared me for the divine appointment in September 2016 that would change my life forever. Upon attending a prophetic healing conference, a prophet named Dr. GeorDavie prophesied that I was called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ; I was called to reach the nations and be a vessel of God’s power, walking in miracles. Hearing this prophecy, I felt inadequate and unqualified. I never had a desire to preach, and public speaking was my biggest fear and weakness. I felt like Moses did when he said to the Lord, “Please, Lord, I have never been a skilled speaker” (Exod. 4:10, Exp). Nevertheless, all I wanted was to be in God’s will, so I simply obeyed and put aside my aspiration at that time of being a Christian singer/songwriter.

I started a church (now 5F Church in Los Angeles; 5F is short for Five-Fold) nine months after receiving the prophecy, and for the first four years the church was small and actually shrank in size. All the while, I kept remembering the prophecy and trusting in God to fulfill His promise. On December 30, 2020, I posted a one-minute video on TikTok that was made up of moments where God’s power moved at 5F Church. At the end of the video, I also prayed for the oppressed. This video reached one million views by my thirtieth birthday on January 1. Even more shocking, thousands of people commented about miracles they received while watching it (pain, sickness, and oppression left them).

From thereon, more of my videos went viral and miracles happened on every live stream, with a rapidly growing audience. By mid-March the church grew from a couple of people to about twenty people. On March 21, 2021, a demon manifested in a woman who traveled across the United States to attend the church. By God’s grace and power, as I commanded the demon to leave the woman, it left her. This was the first demon that manifested in my ministry and the first time a demon was cast out in my ministry. A video of her deliverance went viral, and from there word spread rapidly about the deliverance taking place at 5F Church. Deliverances continued to take place each week, and by May 30 the church grew to three hundred people and revival broke out beyond our dreams.

Ever since that eventful day, people have traveled from all over the United States and all ends of the world weekly just to experience revival and encounter God’s power at 5F Church in Los Angeles. This revival has expanded all around the world as I have ministered in many nations and more than one million people have watched online. Over the past few years, I have seen mass deliverance and healing take place at every event, with thousands in attendance. I’m left in awe of how massive and unlimited God’s power is, as the miracles taking place at church, revival events, conferences, and online are uncountable and occur on a weekly basis. I give all glory to God and am truly shocked by what He has done in my life. I am humbled daily to be a part of His work on the earth and to serve Him.

We are living in the days our ancestors prayed for! God has brought revival to the world. He has poured out His anointing (His power) and begun the process of restoring aspects of the Acts church that have been lost by and large in the body of Christ. He has released precious “new wine” revelation that was previously replaced with “old wine” religion and churches filled with lukewarm, oppressed children of God. *Unlock Your Deliverance* is a piece of His revival. God has entrusted me with secrets of the anointing and keys of the kingdom of God that unlock deliverance for the oppressed. These precious keys are released in this book so that you may be delivered too and help others be set free.

If you are not experiencing total freedom and perhaps are even oppressed with addiction, depression, anxiety, insomnia, sickness, PTSD, effects from trauma, suicidal thoughts, stagnancy, or other issues, your time for freedom is now! If you want to help others be set free but haven’t known how to help them, God is about to open your spiritual eyes and equip you to help deliver the oppressed. I am so excited for what God is going to do through these pages. I believe your life is about to change forever.

### Chapter 1
## WHAT IS DELIVERANCE?

WHEN YOU LOOK at the ministry of Jesus, three main components stand out: He preached about His kingdom, healed the sick, and cast out demons. In the Gospels we find Jesus constantly releasing His power to destroy the works of the devil. While sometimes that included raising the dead, it regularly involved casting out demons. Mark 1:39 describes His ministry like this: “So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.”
He was not just preaching. He was *also* casting out demons.
Sometimes a demon spoke through a person as Jesus was preaching in a synagogue. At other times, when a demon-possessed person came near Jesus, the demons would manifest and Jesus would cast them out. In another instance a father brought his troubled child to Jesus; Jesus delivered the child from a mute demonic spirit, and the child could then speak.
Deliverance was a crucial part of Jesus’ ministry. And He has called His followers—us—to do the *same works* He did (John 14:12). He commissioned His original disciples to do these works, and He is commissioning us today to do the same. “He called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction” (Matt. 10:1, ESV).
Jesus even promised that “these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover” (Mark 16:17–18, ESV).
In the Book of Acts we find the disciples carrying out these words of Jesus—this Great Commission. In addition to preaching the gospel, they were constantly casting out demons, healing the sick, and at times raising the dead. The casting out of demons wasn’t a minor aspect; it was just as integral to their ministry as it was to Jesus’.
There is no scripture that says, “Demons need to be cast out only in the first-century church, and then there will no longer be a need.” We need deliverance today just as much as people needed it two thousand years ago in the time of Jesus and the Acts church.

Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Heb. 13:8), and He cares about freeing the captives just as much in our day as He did when He walked the earth.

> The Spirit of the LORD is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed.
> —LUKE 4:1-8, NKJV

**WHAT ARE DEMONS, AND WHO IS THE DEVIL?**

A demon is a fallen angel. Demons are also known as “unclean spirits,” “demonic spirits,” and “spirits,” and they are responsible for what is often called “demonic oppression.” The devil, also a fallen angel, used to be the leader of worship in heaven. His leadership position there resulted in a corrupted hierarchy with his demise. In other words, he carries the most demonic supernatural power; his demons serve him and carry lesser supernatural evil powers. Still, their demonic powers can be strong on those who are not equipped and empowered to combat the devil’s schemes. The power of Jesus is far higher than any power the devil or his demons have. But if believers do not access the power of Jesus, demonic power can succeed in bringing oppression in their lives. Deliverance is the casting out of a demon or demons from a person who is undergoing such satanic oppression.

The devil twists the principles of God, using them for evil. He knows that God’s principles work. They are spiritual laws. For example, the principle of “Whatever one sows, that will he also reap” (Gal. 6:7, ESV) can be used for good or bad. The devil wants people to sow into evil, and in turn they will be his agents to do evil in this world. If individuals fill themselves with darkness, they will release darkness to others. This could come in many forms, such as cursing and speaking death over people or doing evil actions toward them like stealing or abusing. If one hangs around people who do evil things, that evil and demonic way of life will enter the person and they will then do evil to others.

The devil has a kingdom, just as God has a kingdom. God's kingdom brings life, but the devils kingdom brings death. God uses angels and human vessels to carry out His works. The devil uses demons and human vessels to carry out his works. God entrusts His anointing (His power) to vessels who are surrendered to Him and have committed to serving Him. Then His vessels do as He commands, releasing the anointing to others to cast out demons, heal the sick, and preach the gospel.

The devil also uses people who are willing to serve him—usually for what they can get out of it: power, fame, money. The devil can give these things to a person for he does indeed have supernatural power. However, these “gifts” from the devil always come with sorrow, whereas gifts from God always come without sorrow.

> The blessing of the LORD makes one rich, and He adds no sorrow with it.
> —PROVERBS 10:22, NKJV

The devil's “gifts” don’t come with protection; they can be taken at any moment. And they can come with demons—making the recipient unable to enjoy these “gifts” because of the torment. The devil may also demand an evil sacrifice from a person who receives his “gifts.”

When the devil uses people as vessels or agents, they become witches and warlocks. The terms witch and warlock describe those who use demonic powers to accomplish the devils agenda. Witches and warlocks indeed exist today; they’re not just make-believe characters we see in movies and books. They are undercover for the most part because the truth of what they do would not be enticing to society at large.

The devil wins only through lies and deception. Witches and warlocks deceive others, making it seem as though what they’re doing is good when really they are releasing demons. For example, a psychic is actually a witch using demonic supernatural powers to access secrets about a person’s life. A demon can follow a person around and learn their habits and details about their life. Then that demon will report to the psychic as the person is sitting there getting their “reading.” When anyone goes to a psychic, they are technically giving demonic powers access to speak into their life. In the spiritual realm that action opens the door and gives the enemy authority to bring demonic oppression. So, some demons come to people through psychics. A psychic never helps a person but actually releases a demon to them.

The devil's kingdom is made up of demons and agents of demons (witches and warlocks) who carry out his works. His agenda is the opposite of God’s. The devil’s kingdom brings death and seeks to steal, kill, and destroy (John 10:10).

The biggest work of the devil—where he’s the most successful—is when demons enter people. For instance, when a demon of addiction enters a person, that person has now become oppressed, and it’s as if a demonic chain is wrapped around them. If they have just one demon of addiction, they will find that in that area (drugs, drinking, masturbation, sex, food, watching porn, and so forth) they absolutely cannot control themselves. Most people who have demonic spirits of addiction want to stop doing the addictive behaviors, but no matter how hard they try, they cannot quit. The same goes for other areas of demonic oppression. For example, when a demon of depression enters a person, the demon has control of the person’s thoughts, sometimes leading to lack of energy, various forms of self-harm, thoughts of suicide, a desire to “check out” of life, and so forth.

The lives of many successful people have taken a turn for the worse because addiction overtook them. Most of these people truly loved their careers and blessings and didn’t want to ruin them with drugs, alcohol, and so on. Others gave into suicidal thoughts or were constantly depressed, no matter how many good things happened to them. Most of them would have preferred to stop the suicidal thoughts rather than end their lives. But they had absolutely no control. These are all results of demonic oppression. This is why the devil works day and night to oppress anyone he can. This is where he has power over people.

Isaiah 10:27 says, “The yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing” (KJV). And Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:8). On the cross Jesus destroyed the curse that gave the devil power over humanity. Now whoever believes that Jesus is Lord receives eternal life and an abundant life here and now (John 10:10). This includes an inheritance from God.

> If [we are His] children, [then we are His] heirs also: heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ [sharing His spiritual blessing and inheritance, if indeed we share in His suffering so that we may also share in His glory.
> —ROMANS 8:17, AMP

Jesus has healing. Jesus has freedom. Jesus has abundant life. Jesus has supernatural resources from heaven. We therefore receive the same as coheirs with Christ. God made this even clearer in another scripture:

> He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed.
> —ISAIAH 53:5, NKJV

Before Jesus went to the cross, He began to shed blood for our healing through the scourging He endured. Scourging involved being whipped with a brutal instrument made of leather straps with sharp objects on the ends that pulled the flesh out. Though this is graphic to read, it’s necessary for you to understand the price Jesus paid so you could be healed today. We should take seriously what Jesus has done for us and never take our inheritance from God lightly but rather treat it with reverence and honor. Today as Christians we believe that healing—which includes freedom—is our right as children of God. It’s as if this “inheritance clause” is in a contract that God has signed. This inheritance belongs to us!

When a person becomes a believer in Jesus, in the spiritual realm they receive this inheritance. Now they can receive healing and freedom. The demons have to leave them. However, demons don’t generally leave the moment a person is saved, although that can happen. Usually demons leave as the person accesses their inheritance from God according to His principles. Delivering His people from demons is one of God’s principles, and He uses His anointed vessels to accomplish this. These men and women of God walk in the authority He has given them and command the demons to leave individuals.

We see this principle first in Jesus’ ministry. As we noted earlier, Scripture says He would preach and cast out demons. Jesus didn’t just preach and do an altar call, and then the people repented and demons automatically left. In addition to preaching repentance, Jesus also executed His authority over the demons, and they would flee.

We also see this principle in the Acts church. Jesus told the disciples/apostles to preach that the kingdom of heaven was at hand and to cast out demons (Matt. 10:7-8). He never told people to cast demons out of themselves; He told them to cast demons out of others. This shows us that God’s principle is for people to seek deliverance by positioning themselves where the anointing is flowing so that the yoke in their lives may be destroyed. When they do as God commanded and meet together as believers (Heb. 10:25), whether physically, online, or in revival meetings and services, they will encounter the anointing that flows through vessels and destroys yokes. And they will be set free! So, today Jesus is still destroying the works of the devil as He moves through anointed vessels, setting the captives free.

In the next chapter we will discuss why deliverance is so needed today.

### **Chapter 2**
## **WHY DELIVERANCE IS NEEDED TODAY**

SO MANY ISSUES that people face today are demonic, and many do not realize it. The devil has worked hard to push a false narrative that deliverance is not necessary and that it is “weird,” “scary,” and only for rare circumstances such as the extremely possessed people portrayed in horror movies that show exor- [text cut off, likely "exorcisms"].

It is in the presence of God’s anointing and through ministers who walk in their authority in Christ that demons are exposed and have to leave.

During Jesus’ earthly ministry, when He was present, demons would expose themselves, speaking out or physically manifesting in people. Demons also manifested in the presence of the apostles and other fivefold ministers in the Acts church. Jesus and the ministers in the Acts church all carried true anointing and walked in authority, boldly and unashamedly confronting demons. When ministers do not embrace the anointing and the ministry of deliverance, the anointing will not come. God does not force Himself. When ministers reject the anointing, demons will hide in people. People in the church may lift their hands in worship, say “Hallelujah,” and never miss a Sunday while demons sit comfortably inside them. It is the anointing that destroys the yoke, not attending any church, listening to a message, or singing worship songs.

### **CAN CHRISTIANS HAVE DEMONS?**

Yes, Christians can have demons. When you give your life to Jesus, your spirit comes alive and is inhabited by the Holy Spirit. You are “born again” because your spirit is co-resurrected with Christ. You are literally a new creation, but you don’t automatically become a completely new person. You don’t get a new body and a new soul.

You are made up of three parts: spirit, soul, and body. Your soul comprises your mind, will, and emotions. Your memories, ways of thinking, desires, and natural feelings don’t get wiped away when you give your life to Jesus. Your soul doesn’t become new upon salvation. Your soul has to be transformed, and that transformation takes place as you continually surrender to God and obey Him, which includes following the principles in His Word. Here is an example of how your mind will transform as you follow His principles.

> Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.
> —ROMANS 12:2

When your mind is thinking carnally (how it always has in the past), be intentional about renewing your mind by reading the Word and meditating on it. As you make meditating on the Word of God a regular part of your life, your mind will be transformed. You will start automatically thinking like Christ and seeing circumstances through His perspective. But this doesn’t happen on day one of becoming a believer.

When you first become a believer, your soul needs a deep cleaning. You may have wrong, carnal ways of thinking. Bad emotions may be flowing regularly from your soul: anger, hatred, bitterness, unforgiveness, jealousy, lust. And there may also be demons that need to be evicted.

Please understand: Demons cannot live in your spirit, where the Holy Spirit dwells. However, demons can live in your soul. It’s like the Holy Spirit lives with your spirit in the bedroom of the house. The bedroom is immaculate, perfectly clean. Yet the kitchen and bathroom are dirty. You may need to clean the other “rooms” in your soul regarding your thoughts and behavior. You may need to stop swearing. You may need to stop meditating on things of darkness—such as lusting after people, thinking hateful thoughts toward another, and always focusing on the negative. You may need to stop doing drugs, sleeping around, or gambling. And an even deeper cleaning may need to take place: evicting demons. It may not only be “trash and dust bunnies” you need to get rid of. There may also be “cockroaches” that need exterminating.

Once you accept Jesus as Lord, the Holy Spirit is your helper, and as you allow Him, He will help you in every area. So, a demon cannot control you as a person—meaning a demon cannot totally possess you as if you're a robot. However, if you are oppressed by a demon in an area of addiction, the demon controls that area until you receive deliverance.

A man who came to my church testified that he had a porn addiction as a believer for decades. He read his Bible often, prayed, fasted, had accountability partners, and did just about everything possible to get rid of this addiction. But the addiction remained. Many people made him feel as if he were the issue—his heart wasn’t good enough, or he wasn’t doing enough. One day he watched a video from my church, 5F Church (Five-Fold Church), and the power of God came through the screen and delivered him. The addiction was totally gone. Years have passed since then, and he hasn’t struggled with pornography at all. Prior to the deliverance, he was a true believer and was filled with the Holy Spirit, yet this one area of his life was controlled by the demonic spirit. But as he sought the Holy Spirit for help, the Holy Spirit led him to where the anointing—the power of God—was being released, and the man was set free!

Rather than get hung up on the arguments of “Can a believer have demons?” or “Is it oppressed or possessed?” why don’t we focus on the depraved state of the people who need freedom? While theological debates rage about this topic, the devil is laughing at the religious debaters, who are allowing the oppressed to stay in bondage by not embracing the anointing and the ministry of deliverance. The current state of the body of Christ is very simple and urgent: God’s people must be free!

### **HOW TO KNOW IF I HAVE A DEMON**

When it seems as if a force is controlling you in a certain area, that is an indication of demonic oppression. Most addicted people don’t want to continue in their addictions, but there is a force that controls them. Have you ever known a Christian who had an addiction and genuinely did everything in their power to stop it, seeking God earnestly, but could not? That Christian most likely had a spirit of addiction. Yes, addiction is a demon.

Depression is a demonic spirit also. Have you ever known a Christian who couldn't shake depression no matter how many times they did all that God said to do, renewing their mind with the Word and declaring “Jesus has given me perfect peace”? That Christian probably had a spirit of depression.

Have you ever known a Christian who was overtaken by anxiety attacks, even though they were truly surrendered to God and meditated on His Word, quoting “God did not give me a spirit of fear” over and over? That Christian most likely had a spirit of anxiety.

There’s a difference between needing to be delivered and needing to crucify your flesh. Feeling anxious at times is not a demon. However, anxiety is a demonic spirit. Feeling sad and down sometimes is not a demon. However, depression is a demonic spirit. Having cravings that you could control if you wanted to is not a demon. However, addiction is a demonic spirit. Allowing your flesh to dominate is not the same as having a yoke that can be destroyed only by the anointing. Still, demons have hidden in people for so long because the devil has tricked us into thinking that nothing is a demon and that instead we ‘just need to stop sinning.”

There are yokes on God’s people that need to be destroyed, and this can be done only by the anointing. Yes, crucifying your flesh is vital. It’s by renewing your mind with God’s Word and choosing God’s will over the devil’s that you keep doors shut to the devil and stay free. But when a demon is already there, deliverance is needed.

The doctrine that says Christians cannot have demons is wrong. The true doctrine is this: Christians cannot have demons when they have followed God’s principles to clean their souls (which, for many, includes receiving deliverance) and live lives surrendered to Jesus, closing all doors to the devil. When you do this, a demon cannot enter you. You are completely protected! Yet prior to encountering the anointing and receiving proper spiritual equipping through the fivefold ministry, believers may be oppressed by demons—as many are today due to a lack of these essentials in the body of Christ.

### **INSTANCES WHERE CHRISTIANS MAY HAVE DEMONS**

Demons enter a person when the person gives them authority. The devil did not have power until Adam and Eve handed over their God-given authority by obeying him rather than God. As soon as they handed their authority to the devil, he gained access and power over their lives.

God gives us free will. We can do the same thing Adam and Eve did if we choose. Jesus has given us authority over the enemy, but we can choose to hand it over to the enemy if we want. Going against God’s commands is the action of following the enemy’s voice instead of God's; it is the action of giving authority to the devil rather than to God. When you do what God says, it’s as if you're saying, “I give You authority over my life. Your will be done. You are my master and leader.” When you do what the enemy says, it’s like saying, “I’m choosing to do what you want; therefore, I’m giving you authority to be my leader.”

So, in the spiritual realm, simply by disobeying God, a person opens a door to the devil, giving him access and permission to do what he wants. And what he wants is to fill the person with demons, as that is how he then imprisons and controls them.

Before salvation, people may have opened the “doors” of their souls to spirits of addiction by indulging in drugs, pornography, gambling, and so on. They might have allowed spirits of rage to enter because they followed their emotions and lashed out at anyone they felt anger toward. Sometimes a person may experience deliverance immediately upon being saved. Jesus can deliver a person however He wants, and we should never put Him in a box by saying, “He can deliver someone only this way.” However, most testimonies I’ve heard sound like this: “Upon salvation my life changed as I fell in love with Jesus and His Spirit entered my life. Loneliness went away as I found a friend in Jesus, and I experienced peace, joy, hope, and contentment for the first time in my life. But the addiction (or anxiety, rage, nightmares, insomnia, etc.) remained.” Can you relate?

Many of these struggles persist after a person’s salvation because deliverance is still needed. Salvation and deliverance are two separate things. Jesus is our Savior, Healer, Deliverer, and giver of abundant life. You receive the gift of Jesus and what He provides by faith in Him. The problem is that many people have faith in Jesus the Savior but not in Jesus the Deliverer. A big reason for this is that, by and large, the news hasn’t gotten out that Jesus can deliver—that Jesus can and wants to deliver you from every kind of oppression.

> So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
> —ROMANS 10:17, NKJV

People need to hear from Christian leaders and all believers that Jesus is their Savior and Deliverer and Healer so they can then have faith to receive the deliverance and healing. Some of God’s people are being destroyed by demons oppressing them because they lack the knowledge about Jesus the Deliverer.

> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
> —HOSEA 4:6, NKJV

Christians can have demons as the result of two things: (1) they had demons prior to salvation, and since being saved, they have yet to experience deliverance, many times because they have not encountered the anointing that destroys the yoke; and (2) after salvation they opened doors to demons.

As I said previously, all of us are given free will. When you follow God’s commands in His Word (with the proper revelation from the Holy Spirit) and truly live surrendered to God, you will not open doors to demons, and therefore demons cannot enter you. No Christian should be afraid that a demon will enter them, but instead they should have the fear of God, remembering that the rewards of freedom and protection from demons come from living surrendered to Him. In short, if you surrender to God and obey Him, demons cannot enter you! But if you choose, out of your own free will, to open a door through disobedience, a demon could enter you, even if you call yourself a Christian and the Holy Spirit lives in you.

Most people who think that Christians can’t have demons probably don’t understand what demons truly are and how common they are. Addiction is a demonic stronghold; it is not a person's lack of self-control. All drugs can have an addictive nature, which is actually mobilized by a demonic influence. Many a person whose drug addiction is destroying their life strongly desires to stop doing drugs. Yet how many examples have you seen or heard where no matter how hard a person tried to quit, they couldn’t? When this is the case, it is absolutely a spirit of addiction.

If a person—whether nonbeliever or believer—takes drugs every day, they will get addicted. Being addicted means having a spirit of addiction. A Christian isn’t immune from getting a demon of addiction just because they’re a Christian. It’s up to them to obey God or not. That is one of the simplest explanations of how a believer can have a demon—and of why it is so common today for Christians to be oppressed by demons.

Many believers open doors to demons by disobeying God in certain areas. Some choose to be lukewarm. For others, the reason is the lack of anointing in the church today that is necessary to release God’s kingdom on believers. Paul said, “My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power, so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God’s power” (1 Cor. 2:4-5). Some people are living lukewarm lives, disobeying God and opening doors to the devil, not because they have a bad heart but because they have yet to encounter God’s power, which opens spiritual eyes and builds a true faith in Him.

## **FREE OF DEMONIC OPPRESSION AND STEP INTO YOUR CALLING?**

A s a young woman, Kathryn Krick left her home in upstate New York for Los Angeles to pursue her dreams in acting and music—until a prophetic conference changed her life forever. Encountering God’s power, she heard His call to be an apostle and started a small church on a hillside off Mulholland Drive that has grown to a global congregation across more than 150 nations. Today, 5f Church and Krick’s online ministry have become epicenters of signs and wonders, including undeniable deliverance and healing.

Apostle Kathryn believes God is calling believers to restore the lost principles of the Acts church—including the anointing to be healed and delivered. In *Unlock Your Deliverance*, she reveals that Jesus Christ is the answer to the struggles we face. This powerful book will guide you to:

*   **UNDERSTAND** what deliverance is and why it’s essential for believers today
*   **RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS** of demonic oppression in your life
*   **RECEIVE DELIVERANCE** through surrender, faith, and the anointing
*   **BREAK FREE** from stress, addiction, depression, and more
