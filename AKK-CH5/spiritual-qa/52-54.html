how does one achieve purity how does one achieve Purity so
0:09
God is pure God is pure he is completely good there is no
0:17
impurity in him there's no bad in him and he's called us to be like him he's called us to be transformed into his
0:23
image and that happens by seeking him that happens by following his word
0:31
and his principles and being surrendered and being so
0:36
serious about seeking him every day and so when you do those things
0:41
the result is you will become more like him you will become more pure
0:47
so that's the first part right there and then you also have to know that the devil's
0:55
uh big attack that he brings upon Believers is bringing lies in your mind and trying to
1:02
speak against your purity whether he's coming with condemnation or
1:07
whether he's bringing you impure desires and thoughts that you don't want to have but they just enter
1:14
your mind or your heart and what happens is um the devil can bring these impure
1:22
desires and thoughts and this can look like sexual lustful this can look like
1:28
um uh uh jealousy this can look like uh this obsession with having a platform
1:37
obsession with having success obsession with having money obsession with
1:43
um just your own selfish motives obsession with how people see you so the
1:50
devil can bring these impure thoughts in your in your head in your heart and you're you know you're having these
1:56
feelings like I want this ah these jealous feelings lustful feelings
2:01
ambitious selfish ambitious you know and and what the devil wants you to think is
2:07
that that's you that you are impure because these thoughts are happening in
2:13
your head these feelings are happening in your heart but when you give your life to Jesus
2:19
God calls you pure he calls you the righteousness of God that's who you are in the spirit but your soul has to be
2:25
transformed so really the the answer is your soul has to be transformed and it will be
2:32
transformed as you continually seek God as you continually reject the devil as
2:37
you continually obey his commands obey his word written and
2:43
present tense word Rhema word the word that's coming through your teachers through your spiritual mother for
2:48
example me these words that are these instructions these teachings these teachings like on here these teachings
2:55
on Sundays these teachings on lives you know you really take them to heart and you apply them in your life and you
3:01
meditate them and again again and again you take it seriously there will automatically be transformation that comes to you
3:09
and so um what if you're having impure thoughts and feelings you need to renew your mind
3:15
this isn't me I don't want these there's a difference some people they they have them and they
3:21
they don't have that moment of being like I don't want this but they just accept them and then maybe
3:28
they act on them or they let them stew and that's where you're not going to be
3:33
transformed so you can keep on coming to church you can keep on listening to the word you can keep you know doing all the
3:39
right things but transformation is not going to come and that's when you're not being pure
3:44
you're you're you're accepting impurity you're accepting the devil's lies of impurity
3:49
but when those thoughts and feelings of impurity come you need to step back and say
3:58
no I don't want this I don't want this lust I don't want to lust after this
4:05
person no I don't want to feel jealousy of this person no I don't want this I
4:11
don't want this obsession with how people see me I don't want this obsession with wealth I don't want this
4:16
obsession with this with with with this dream that's just really a selfish
4:22
ambition I don't want that I don't want that and and and maybe your feelings
4:27
feel strong like you do want it but like your heart of hearts like deep down your
4:33
heart of hearts that wants to please God more than anything
4:38
wants doesn't want it wants Purity that's what counts not your feelings
4:45
right right because even like with lust or something the body can be like aroused but like your heart doesn't want
4:52
that so that and that can be other things like you're feeling you want
4:57
success money people it's you want someone else to go down you're jealous whatever you feel that but
5:04
above all of that your heart of hearts wants God's will which means doesn't
5:12
want these things so you have to understand that difference and not feel guilty or condemned that you know just
5:19
even if you're feeling these things it doesn't mean it's you so if you think it's you if you and these
5:25
feelings are strong then you'll be in this pattern you're being you'll be in this cycle where you won't be transformed because you're not actually
5:31
rejecting those lies of the devil you really need to be more spiritual and
5:36
understand that so many of your thoughts and your emotions aren't you you can be hunted by the
5:44
devil with a wrong motive you can be hunted by the Devil with the
5:51
wrong motive and this is a big thing we see in ministries where the anointing is
5:57
actually uh because because like
6:03
the closer you come it's like the the more of it like there's this is the area
6:10
where the devil can try to why don't want to try to pierce in to try to really get in and attack the anointing
6:15
attack the leader of of that the ministry with the anointing the
6:22
devil's looking for um how to get close because he can't come on the outside he
6:28
won't be very successful coming on the outside and this can be in just a bunch of different schemes you know this could
6:33
be um with like lustful schemes this could be
6:39
with just um religious lies of the devil with like
6:45
false accusations all sorts of things wrong motivations like um sometimes a
6:51
person starts serving in the ministry serving the anointing with a pure heart um and but maybe before they really were
7:00
struggling with being with acceptance like they felt like they they needed to succeed
7:07
for people to like them or something maybe they hadn't really fully dealt with that or something you know been
7:12
freed of that you know maybe they had these big selfish Ambitions before where it really
7:20
mattered to them to have success and how they looked and to have money or something
7:25
so then if that's not dealt with let's say and then you come close to the anointing
7:31
you're serving in the anointing and so many times there can be that like envy
7:38
that comes kind of like Saul towards David like Saul wanted to be exactly what David Saul just wanted to do
7:44
exactly what David was doing but Saul couldn't do what David was doing David was his own person everyone has their
7:49
own callings and so that can happen many times uh when a person gets closer to the
7:55
anointing they can start out with a good heart but then the devil can specifically hunt them with a certain
8:01
impure motivation like um
8:06
you want to be like that you want to be like that but not in a good way not in a good not a good imitation but like in a
8:14
in a weird ambition way you know um and so that's what I'm saying like
8:19
the devil will many times can hunt people so this is just a prophetic
8:25
word for those of you um serving in the anointing serving closer
8:31
that the the Purity is what's most important because when you're the closer you are
8:37
in the anointing like you're kind of like a lot you're like Elisha to Elijah or Timothy to Paul so
8:44
God's calling is for you to carry a lot of responsibility carry more
8:50
anointing do more important works of God like the like the most important works
8:57
of God that's God's calling for you and the devil knows that but Purity is
9:02
what's required for that the pure in heart is what's the most important thing so the devil then tries to attack that
9:10
Purity he doesn't want that to happen he doesn't want there to be this strong Army of pure hearts so he strategically
9:18
attacks with impurity like um like thoughts and lies of impurity so he can
9:23
specifically bring lustful um like maybe a person doesn't struggle with lust that much but all of a sudden
9:29
out of nowhere they're haunted by the enemy with lustful thoughts and desires
9:35
they're they they didn't have such selfish Ambitions before but all of a sudden they are going crazy with this
9:42
impure hunger in them with these selfish Ambitions they are being hunted by the enemy uh so I say
9:49
this as a prophetic warning and also um for you to be aware for you to not get down but for you to know what's
9:56
going on that you're being hunted you know what I mean like like the devil's strategically sending these thoughts and
10:01
emotions they are not you but you have to be aware of that because if you accept them because you you're not being spiritual you're being like carnal where
10:09
you think your thoughts and feelings are just your thoughts they're just yours but if you're being if you're being carnal you'll accept them
10:16
but if you are spiritual you'll know oh this is what's going on the devil is coming with this specific attack
10:22
attacking attacking my Purity my Purity hasn't changed I haven't become more impure because all of a sudden I'm
10:27
having these thoughts and emotions that are impure but it's that the devil is strategically coming in this way
10:33
so I reject them I reject them you specifically speak them out loud if it's if you're being hunted like this like an
10:39
attack of the devil like all of a sudden you find this go to war in the spirit by
10:45
never letting a thought linger never letting a feeling linger but consistently reject reject reject reject
10:52
reject reject and declare the truth declare the opposite you know God's truth Purity uh the opposite of what the
10:59
devil's speaking so um those are just some those are some
11:05
keys of seeing the Purity come to you now what's going to happen is your soul will be transformed so at first
11:13
the devil is really able to send a lot of lies and thoughts in your soul but as you grow as you keep seeking God
11:20
keeps surrendering keep soaking yourself in the anointing and continually go to war in the spirit and reject the devil's
11:26
lies constantly the Bible says that you submit to God so you soak yourself in him and his anointing submit to God
11:33
resist the devil and he must flee so that's that's really what happens so
11:38
over time you literally stop having those feelings and thoughts and so you
11:43
get to the place where you actually feel pure but but don't be discouraged if you
11:49
don't feel completely pure yet it doesn't mean you're not pure it just means that your soul is being transformed but that doesn't mean like
11:55
you're this impure person who hasn't reached the Purity destination yet no it's just that the soul is being
12:01
transformed to match the truth of you the real you your spirit so you can really enjoy the the
12:09
not having the nonsense of the enemy trying to bring in Purity but you're thinking pure you're feeling pure
12:15
how do you keep your heart pure so that's pretty much what I answered but I just want to add something on to this too of like really really keeping your
12:22
heart pure uh be just be on the lookout anytime you're having a thought that
12:28
isn't pure don't let it stay but reject it and talk to God about it and confess
12:33
the truth um it can you know I Surrender Lord I want your will
12:39
um I want your timing if you're having all these like anxious thoughts like oh I want this to happen for example you
12:46
know and like impatient and maybe feeling entitled and taking for granted
12:52
what God's blessed you with and feeling like just want more like that kind of feeling
12:59
you know be real with yourself with the thoughts you're having and don't condemn yourself just be real
13:04
with yourself and say renew your mind no Lord I'm Grateful I
13:10
want your will I want your timing that's what I want above all else so that that that that that that that keeps you pure
13:16
so you are staying focused and not diverting to this impure
13:21
place the devil wants to take you why did Jesus come to save our souls and not our Spirits if the spirits are the real
13:26
us so some things sometimes the language can
13:31
make things confusing um like possessed versus oppressed
13:38
like there's I mean we don't a lot of words we don't like fully understand or the dictionary
13:44
doesn't even fully describe the proper meaning and you know what I mean so a lot of things like
13:50
um if someone says oh that person was possessed by the demon and they were Christian they'll be like no they
13:55
weren't possessed but then another person can say like no they weren't possessed because Christians have the
14:01
Holy Spirit so they can't be possessed but another person can say well when the anointing hit them their whole
14:07
entire body was taken over by the spirit so their whole body was possessed by a demon doesn't mean that like the Holy
14:13
Spirit wasn't there you know it doesn't mean that every day the the spirit was possessing them but at that moment the
14:20
spirit did possess them was making them unconscious words were coming out
14:25
of them their body couldn't move or their body's flailing whatever you know what I mean so like and so so so if people if
14:33
someone's if someone says to me like and this person was possessed by a demon I don't feel like I need to correct them
14:39
do you know what I mean because they kind of mean the same thing and we're getting too much into semantics and in the language and just do you know what
14:46
I'm trying to say so that's kind of how it is with like Soul and Spirit so like
14:52
I mean yeah don't think so like technical if that
14:59
makes sense so when we say when we say when I'm when I'm talking
15:04
about Spirit soul and body and how your soul is your mind and your role in your emotions I'm talking about
15:09
um I'm trying to help you understand that there's different parts in your mind and your will and your emotions but
15:16
you can say Jesus came to save our souls and Jesus came to save our spirits that means like the same thing if that makes
15:22
sense so just don't get hung up on like technicalities you know what I mean but understand that a lot of words there's
15:29
like crossovers with their meanings and it's more of like a language thing
15:34
if that makes sense logos and Rhema so logos simply means
15:40
the written word of God the Bible Rhema means spoken word of God present tense
15:45
word of God prophecy so it can mean prophecy and like true prophecy and also
15:53
the the prophetic word of teaching like
15:58
today you're receiving Rhema word you're receiving Revelation from the word of
16:04
God being brought to you today so it's it's true word of God coming at you
16:10
do we have to repent every morning before saying our prayers no repent when you need to it should not be a religious
16:17
tradition or else that holds no weight to it if you say I Repent of all my sins you're not really repenting from the
16:23
heart you're just doing it out of tradition so that when you really do need to repent there's no weight to it
16:28
you know what I mean but when you repent it should be really from the heart like
16:33
I've done something wrong I've made a mistake I feel sorry I need to I need to
16:40
come to God and say I'm sorry it should be really from the heart
16:46
because that's what will bring the true lasting repentance a true change
16:53
in you in your heart how about how much time we need to pray this is going to look different for
16:59
every single person because it's a relationship it's it should be relationship so it's like this there
17:05
isn't a um rule when you go to marriage counseling before you get married there
17:11
will not be an exact number of minutes spent per day that you need
17:17
to be talking with your spouse that the marriage counselor will give you and you say I know yes I commit to
17:24
spent spending this amount of time communicating you know and so when we get thinking
17:32
about like how much that that's where we go into religion that's where we lean into performance and we make it not
17:38
about relationship it becomes like robotic if you were thinking to yourself I have to spend 50 minutes per day
17:44
talking with my spouse you set a timer and you're like okay we have to keep
17:49
talking we can't I better make sure I go to the bathroom first and like
17:55
it becomes like so robotic right so that's how it is with God you don't want it to be robotic you don't want to be
18:01
religious you don't want it to be so ritualistic but you want it to be real relationship because that's when God's
18:07
able to really get in your heart and really mold your heart and where real intimacy is happening where real where
18:14
you're really able to experience his experience his love it's his love that brings this transformation in you
18:21
your real love for him that leads you to seek him that leads you to follow him
18:27
follow his instructions it's love that leads to all of that so you need to
18:32
experience his love be continually experience continue to experiences love being in relationship with him for you
18:39
to even be transformed into His Image into being his will so important so uh
18:45
that can't give you a time you're supposed to pray but the Bible does say pray continually pray at all times
18:51
and so you should be including god without you it
18:57
including God in your whole day throughout your whole day like renew your what's really
19:04
important is to renew your mind that he's always with you because when we start to be thinking about I need to set aside this time of
19:11
prayer many times we get thinking of like God is hidden in a room he's hidden
19:16
in the the prayer closet and he's sitting right there and he's waiting for you and he's nowhere else and so you
19:22
forget about him the rest of the day you won't communicate with him the rest of the day you won't do what the Bible says pray at all times you will include him
19:30
you won't open your ears to listen for to him and you're just living about your day
19:35
separated from him and then you come in the prayer closet and then when you're doing it with that kind of intention
19:41
you're just doing it I gotta do this so then it's not even real relationship it's not even real intimacy you're not
19:46
even able to really hear God so it's good to set aside time to talk with God to pray with God but
19:53
um I mean you should be renewing your mind that this is really a relationship like um don't make it so cold and um rigid
20:02
but he's your best friend so um this should be exciting this should
20:08
be uh exciting to to set to have this set aside time but this shouldn't really
20:14
even be the meat of your prayer time I mean the the meat should be continually throughout the whole day you know like I
20:21
mean sometimes it can be the meat but I mean that's just the the set aside time is just extra with
20:28
the continual communal time with him and it doesn't always have to mean like
20:34
you're talking to him it can sometimes mean just you're Renewing Your Mind that he's with you and just
20:42
um putting your eyes on him like looking at him right and that's intimacy like if
20:47
you have um like someone you really love maybe it's a parent maybe it's a spouse but like
20:54
you just look at each other and you give this look of just love um and you don't even say anything but
21:00
that's intimacy so throughout your day you can just look in God's eyes with
21:06
love and that's relationship that's intimacy that's a part a kind of Prayer
21:12
can we reject the lies in our minds instead of speaking out loud uh somewhat but the the the the power of
21:20
life and death is in your tongue so the power to destroy these lies to get them out of your mind
21:27
the way to reject the big way is to speak uh but uh you do need to turn your mind Focus your
21:35
mind differently that's a part of rejecting because the Bible says we fix
21:40
our eyes on the Unseen not the scene you you fix you you turn your mind and also
21:46
the the Bible says whatever is pure admirable worthy of
21:51
Praise think of such things so there does need to be a turning of your mind
21:57
as well like a mind shift like stop thinking of this and think and intentionally think of something
22:03
different think of God think of Godly things think of pure things put your mind there
22:09
and also use your mouth and speak aloud and reject but yeah if you're like in a
22:14
public place or something where you can't really like be speaking too much doing in your mind fix your mind on on
22:22
what is good sometimes though you can just whisper you can whisper something Whispering can count counts just the same as screaming as
22:29
yelling it works just the same is it true that the enemy can't hear
22:35
your thoughts he can only hear what you say out loud so the enemy yeah the enemy
22:41
cannot hear your thoughts the enemy is not Omni present like God
22:48
is so a lot of the
22:54
things that you're speaking it's not necessarily like the devil hearing because he's not omnipresent but it's he
23:00
has a lot of demons working for him so familiar spirits demons can be
23:06
hearing what you're saying and report to the devil so the devil in
23:12
his kingdom knows what you're saying and then knows the ammunition to send against you knows your weak spots and
23:18
knows that there's an Open Door there oh have you heard the news this person speaking these words of death so we have
23:25
an open door here let's go the door is left unlocked let's go tonight
23:31
um but so yeah the devil can't hear your your thoughts why it's that's why it's so
23:38
important that you realize like whenever if you're having negative thoughts don't let the devil
23:43
when like don't let him don't let him think he's more powerful than he is you
23:48
know don't get frustrated and speak out loud about your thoughts you know be
23:54
confident and just just simply speak I reject those thoughts instead of like
24:00
whining oh
24:05
so then when you start speaking that because the devil can then hear your
24:12
words the devil knows oh it worked so like these lies I'm sending this
24:18
strategy this Ambush I'm saying in their mind they're believing these lies and they are not being strong in the spirit
24:24
they're not being spiritual to uh do what the word of God says and
24:32
take every thought captive to Christ they're not tearing down these
24:38
imaginations that are sent from the devil they're not doing that so I I know them like the devil can get
24:45
to know you and get to know how you think based on you how you act so
24:52
when you act and speak very spiritual the devil knows that he has no game on
24:58
your mind that's part of why the Bible says resist the devil and he'll flee it's like he gives up kind of in that
25:05
area and at the same time he just there's no game there you you've won so
25:11
he puts his game elsewhere and at the same time it's like a reward that the
25:16
devil doesn't get to keep going in your mind because you are passing the test spiritually
25:24
it's like both you're getting the reward where he's not allowed to come anymore and at the same time he's like not even
25:30
wanting to come anymore because it's a waste of his ammo because the devil isn't God he can't be
25:38
doing millions of things at one time like attacking wise you know
25:43
um he's intentional he's strategic if you think about in the kingdom of God
25:49
how like I'm being strategic right now by God I I I I'm
25:56
I'm doing this live right now to 82 people here live presently
26:02
84 now 84 who are serious about going to the next level and I'm going to make
26:08
this public for those who couldn't join the live and so that people can get to know and seeds
26:15
are planted maybe they want to come join the live the subscriber live and just so more people can be blessed right but
26:22
during this time of one hour one and a half hours or whatever that I'm doing this I can only do this
26:28
God can only do this through me right now God can't also send me to help orphans and widows right
26:36
at the second he can't also send me to minister in Japan at a Revival event
26:42
right at this second he can't use me to edit videos right at this second he
26:48
can't use me to prepare Sunday's message at this second you know what I mean like
26:53
I can only do this God can only do this one thing through me at this moment that's why
26:59
imagine how powerful the army of God will be when everyone Rises up like all believers rise up God will be
27:06
able to do so much more because God chooses to use people so that's how it is in the devil's Kingdom these demons that are sent around
27:12
they're sent by witches they're sent by human vessels of the devil so the devil's kingdom is a counterfeit
27:18
of God's Kingdom so the devil's limited the devil that's why the Bible says the
27:24
devil is roaring around like a lion seeking whom he can devour he's not trying to devour everyone at one time he
27:30
goes and tries over here then he goes and then he leaves you alone he goes and tries over here he leaves you alone and you don't see him for a while and then
27:36
he comes back he's being strategic he's being like a lion he's roaring around looking
27:42
um coming with strategy so that's why you know you need to be more spiritual and
27:48
outsmart the devil like you have the power to overcome him and
27:55
get him to leave you alone and conquer him and say you can't come in my mind anymore you've lost that battle devil
28:02
you can't come here anymore your lies have no effect on me so
28:08
see ya you know right I mean this is powerful right
28:13
Hallelujah so um so the devil can't like straight out
28:19
hear your thoughts but the devil's been around for a long time and the devil's a spirit so he's like
28:26
smarter than most Christians in the in terms of like spiritually like so many Christians are carnal
28:33
um but his Spirit his demons are Spirit so they can figure out the demons can
28:40
figure out things and report to the devil like the demons can figure out how a person's Thinking by how they act by how they speak so in a way your thoughts
28:46
can be read in a way it's like they can be interpreted based on what you will give what information you will give
28:53
so if you choose to not give that information then the devil can't read your thoughts
28:59
and sometimes he can read your thoughts in a good way like seeing I mean he can imagine interpret your thoughts like
29:06
you know if you're living so Godly and you're um constantly only speaking words of life for example uh
29:13
the devil can see their their mind is a sound mind and
29:20
they are focused on God and so they the devil can even like like interpret
29:26
your mind in that way that's not a bad thing that's showing like he sees you're too powerful for him God
29:34
in you is too powerful Hallelujah
29:41
that's why um you should be that's why you shouldn't complain to God I mean complaining to God doesn't make
29:46
any sense it's rude to God it's disrespectful it's whiny it's being like a brat you know what I mean it's like if
29:53
your your father's the the king of the whole world but like let's pretend it's a king
29:59
um pretend there's a king of the world that's physical or something and you're the son or daughter and it's like you're like the only son and daughter you're
30:05
like the top son or daughter or something right you're that favored and you're
30:11
complaining that you're not going to have the kind of
30:17
um you you you you're complaining about the food you're eating you're complaining
30:22
about the clothes you have and you're not you don't see what you really have and it just it's like being a brat you
30:29
know how would it we should have that fear of God like even though our mind can't comprehend all the riches all the
30:36
Glorious riches that we have in Christ even though it's hard for us to comprehend I know we're not there yet all the way it's hard for us to comprehend really
30:42
what we have access to what God has already given us um but even though we can't comprehend
30:48
it we should have the fear of God right we should have the fear of God like even though I can't really comprehend
30:55
how blessed I am and the Glorious riches I have I know
31:00
that I have glorious riches and complete Abundant Life and I shall not want for anything and there's nothing that I'm
31:06
lacking I believe that spiritual truth and I do not want to complain to God
31:11
that's so embarrassing that's so disrespectful that's so gross you know
31:16
and so like when you think in that proper way spiritually that'll help you
31:21
to not complain that'll help you to not complain so what happens for me when I'm
31:27
feeling like uh if I go through a period where I'm feeling like the waiting is
31:33
hard um and
31:38
if I go through a period where I feel like man I've had to sacrifice a
31:46
lot and not not no one really sees and I'm still having to sacrifice or something you know something like that
31:53
usually you just feel like those types of things if I feel those types of things
31:59
you can go one way and you can start crying and feeling like bad for yourself
32:05
and start maybe even complaining a little bit whining to God
32:10
I've done this for you God I've done this for you Lord can you please bring this like
32:16
don't I deserve this yet you can go that way or you can go the spiritual way which is
32:21
what I choose to do and though I'm feeling those things I just renew my mind I renew my mind you
32:29
know that it doesn't matter the biggest sacrifice I've made it's it it it
32:36
it pales in comparison to what God has given me and
32:42
um the reward that's coming from the sacrifice it renew my mind that
32:48
God sees it all and he doesn't take it lightly but um it's worth it and
32:56
we don't even need a reward because he's given us so much that what is any kind
33:01
of sacrifice compared to what he's given us but he will reward though at the same
33:06
time so you just renew your mind with that renew your mind that he's faithful
33:12
renew your mind that the promises will come to pass renew your mind that his timing is so perfect and the reason that
33:18
he hasn't brought the promise to pass yet is that it's not the right timing which means
33:24
that if it came in the wrong timing the blessings they would fall or the calling
33:30
on your life that wouldn't you would fall it wouldn't hold um the devil would somehow come and tear
33:38
down this calling and everything the promise you know you you knew your mind about
33:45
how God's timing is just perfect his ways are just perfect we don't understand them we want things to come
33:51
earlier lots of times but that's not his timing but thank God that's not his timing you just renew your mind with
33:56
those truths and then so what I do in those moments I renew my mind and then I just
34:02
choose to thank God for his perfect timing and thank God that if he's faithful and and thank God that he's a
34:10
God who rewards and and recommit that surrender to him recommit I surrender to you Lord I
34:17
Surrender my whenever you're feeling those things that you re-surrender recommit I Surrender your timing
34:25
to your timing and I just want your ways Lord I trust you
34:30
so that's the better way to pray that's a spiritual way to pray rather than like
34:36
the complaining a lot of people think you should just like tell all your emotions to God but
34:42
sometimes your emotions are just carnal they're just sent from the enemy and they're not meant to be kept they're
34:48
meant to be rejected like in the situation I'm talking about right now and so even when you're praying to God
34:54
and you're praying all these emotions that you think is this great intimacy you're experiencing because you're
35:00
venting actually it's you being carnal and accepting these
35:07
emotions and thoughts sent from the devil and now you've revealed to the devil that you're believing is
35:14
lies you're accepting his lies now he like knows your thoughts just even in your prayer time with God
35:21
when I pray that way I I always renew my mind that God is proud of me I always it's like
35:29
we're we're soldiers and it's not that
35:34
we can't be like soft in God's arms but to be spiritual the truth is is to be a
35:40
warrior To Be A Champion you know and Paul talks about it lots of times be a
35:45
good soldier so you know it's okay to cry it's okay
35:51
to feel upset it's okay when things get hard be soft in that way cry in God's
35:56
arms sometimes but don't go too much that way don't
36:01
lose your Warrior uh your Warrior strength
36:07
and Mission that God's called you to because that's what faith is Faith is is what faith is is
36:15
doing hard things it's believing the Unseen and not the scene it's constantly
36:22
rejecting the devil's lies it's not something it's not something you can be lazy in but it's something
36:29
you have to be steady in and strong in and God but God gives you the strength
36:34
God gives you the strength it's not like this is something that's just
36:40
um so difficult like can't we just have a break God gives you the strength you
36:46
know can't we just have a break where I can just be lazy and cry and vent but
36:52
God gives you the strength it's not the human way where we take let's take a mental health day and I just want to cry
36:58
in bed all day because I feel like we don't we don't get to do that in the kingdom of God but this life is
37:06
much better choosing the Jesus way choosing the truth choosing to be a warrior this is where the peace and joy
37:11
comes the perfect peace all the time some people are rejecting God's perfect peace and I don't want the peace and joy
37:17
I want the I want to just be a baby today and whine and complain
37:22
but God has given us perfect peace that never leaves through every circumstance
37:30
um so I I always like to see what really strengthens me is when if I feel like venting or
37:36
weeping or something or it's hard if I feel like being that way to God
37:42
um I will instead see him being proud of me and I will
37:48
Cry tears of Joy instead of tears of like pain and sadness and this is hard
37:54
but I will I will see God being proud of me that I'm choosing the faith way that I'm choosing not to complain that I'm
38:01
choosing to just speak words of life I see that and it immediately makes all
38:06
of that other stuff go and gives me strength and gives me
38:11
motivation I've always wondered how will God how will church leaders come to know
38:17
the revelation of how God moves without religious Traditions like the same
38:23
anointing at 5f every church is supposed to look the same this is a mystery to us
38:29
all but God is going to do it the Bible says in the word and this is this word
38:34
of God is a is a this logos word of God in the Bible is a Rhema word of God for today
38:41
I will once again Astound my people with Wonder upon Wonder
38:47
it's in Isaiah he's doing a new thing I will confound the wisdom of the world the wisdom of
38:54
the wise will perish so this is really a word for today
39:00
that's what's going to happen that's how God's going to do it he's simply going to confound he's simply going to confound the religious know what alls the religious
39:06
know-it-alls in the church he's simply going to confound them with Wonder upon Wonder
39:12
you look at you I mean just expect wonders
39:18
the story of Moses I mean how impossible was that for Pharaoh with his heart
39:24
hardened and all to let millions of slaves go
39:32
if you think about how ridiculous that sounds like how on Earth is God gonna do
39:39
that how Wonder with Wonder upon Wonder
39:45
with Wonder upon wonder and so God we haven't seen nothing yet
39:53
I'm telling you we haven't seen nothing yet God will shock us
40:00
shock all of us he will shock the whole world he will shock Many religious
40:06
people with Wonder upon Wonder only by his power it can't be by just like teaching
40:12
it can only be by power his power it can only be by Miracles God will prove I
40:19
love the story of Moses Moses keeps saying like how will they know that you're with me God
40:25
how how will they believe me how will they really really know that you sent me and God's like
40:31
I'm gonna do wonders through you and they'll believe and that's actually what happened like that that really happened
40:38
so um that's like how we are today like how will eyes opened up this is the end time
40:44
Revival God needs to transform his whole bride and it's only like a very small
40:50
percentage right now that's saying yes to this transformation how is God going to do it well I'll tell
40:57
you one thing it probably won't be tomorrow that he returns prom we don't know the time but I will say we do have
41:03
work to do we do have work to do to get everyone on board to get the whole body of Christ on board but um
41:11
uh we're like What will God do he will do Wonder upon Wonder he is gonna show up in Mighty signs
41:18
wonders and miracles Way Beyond what we have seen so far and it's gonna get the attention of the
41:24
whole world it's gonna get the attention of all religious people and many people
41:29
will not be able to deny it they just won't be able to nine to deny just as they weren't they weren't able
41:35
to deny God was with Moses they tried they tried at first they tried it first
41:43
Moses turned the the Nile into blood and um
41:49
and God was having him do this to try to open up pharah's eyes that God was with him that this was God
41:56
and uh he he finds magicians and they do the same counterfeit miracle and so he
42:02
like doesn't even really believe so there's that struggle there's that struggle where we can feel like man
42:10
there's been Miracle upon miracle there's been testimony after testimony what will it take but God keeps going he
42:17
keeps going with Moses until the day comes and he's going to keep going in this
42:23
revival doing Wonder upon wonder where people just won't be able to deny there will be some Pharisees that stay
42:29
Pharisees they will they absolutely will but there will be a greater amount that whose eyes will open up so that the
42:36
whole body of Christ really can be transformed and there will be anointing all over the world in churches all over
42:43
not just one church not not just one church but all churches all over this will happen we will see this happen we
42:50
will see God confound many many people Hallelujah
42:56
that's why if your eyes have seen um if your eyes have seen
43:02
you are very blessed and um you know you should see like this
43:08
antonym Revival right now it's very much like Moses in the beginning it is just like some some people could see but not
43:15
everyone and then eventually more would see so you are we are blessed we are blessed
43:22
for our eyes to be opened up first many more eyes will open up so value
43:28
the place God has brought you in the beginning the beginning times of this end time Revival value this place don't
43:36
take it lightly don't wait for it to be in stadiums to take it more seriously
43:42
it's the same Jesus moving in power purifying his bride
43:49
as it will be in stadiums same Jesus moving in power now so value him value his anointing now
43:58
don't wait so that God can use you more powerfully so you so he can entrust you with more
44:04
anointing and entrust you with more responsibility now because that's what he's calling you to now
44:12
don't stand on the outer courts come into the the holy of holies
44:20
don't stand on the outer courts looking and waiting for more signs for
44:26
stadiums to come step into the inner courts
44:32
step into the holy of holies so God can use you holy of holy level use you
44:37
in the anointing with the responsibility for give you more responsibility in his
44:42
work in his kingdom a lot of people judge like the value of the work of God
44:50
based on size and numbers um and they they wait they wait you know
44:58
and they're just they're missing out they're missing out does this mean every five-fold office
45:04
should operate in the same anointing but different functions yes yes
45:10
every five-fold Minister should carry the anointing
45:16
the anointing that destroys Yokes so that they can fulfill the Great
45:22
Commission so that they can do what Jesus said to preach that the kingdom of God is at hand to heal the sick
45:30
to cast out demons to raise the Dead this is the commission for every
45:36
believer and especially it better be for the faithful ministers they're showing the example
45:42
they are releasing the impartation yeah so what I was speaking about was
45:48
how I mean this is really a commission that God has given everybody that we should
45:56
tell that the kingdom of God is at hand preach of the kingdom of God is at hand and in lay hands on the sick and they
46:01
shall be healed and cast out demons raise the dead
46:07
um and so if that's really the calling for everybody then that's definitely the calling for faithful ministers for every
46:14
faithful Minister this is just simple simple Christianity that has been lost
46:20
but this should be the basics that we carry the anointing the power of God
46:25
every one of us and the faithful ministers better carry it because they're the ones that are called to
46:31
equip the Believers to do these things to to preach to heal the sick and to
46:37
cast out demons they're the ones supposed to be equipping them and releasing impartation of anointing
46:43
so yeah this truly is everyone's calling and everyone will have a different callings like some will will have
46:50
different giftings of the Holy Spirit different gifts of the Spirit so some people have a bigger calling to
46:58
cast out principalities demons you know they'll be different Graces but at the end of the day it is God's calling for
47:05
everyone to carry a measure of the anointing so that if someone has demons that you
47:11
can cast them out by God's power when they come to your ministry when they come to your church
47:16
sometimes I don't pray for people because I know it will just
47:21
I will just cry will I grow out of that feels like it takes the attention from the person
47:28
um don't worry about that because if if the crying that you're feeling is is
47:33
really like compassion it sounds like it's compassion compassion you have for the person
47:40
and that's beautiful and and God uses compassion however it manifests
47:46
sometimes when sometimes when I see a person cry there's different kinds of tears people can be crying fake tears
47:53
people can be crying real tears and real tears real tears like compassion tears are
48:01
beautiful they are absolutely beautiful and you
48:06
never should be ashamed of them um compassion tears empathy tears
48:12
are absolutely beautiful tears of of of love and awe of God and
48:18
joy of God these are beautiful these are beautiful now God will give you strength to still
48:24
be mature you know and not to to to cry so much that it's
48:30
uh a distraction or you know God will help you give you the strength
48:36
but first of all don't feel bad about tears and I don't feel
48:42
bad about tears especially when they come with come with love you never know how someone's tears will touch you I've
48:48
seen people's tears have really touched me touched my heart some people's tears have really really touched my heart
48:55
um so don't worry about that just pray for people and if tears come that's okay
49:01
and sometimes God will use that to show his love even to the person that you love them with the love of God so much
49:07
that the compassion is so strong that there's Tears In This Moment and at the same time it doesn't mean
49:13
that without if there's no tears it doesn't mean there's not compassion so for those of you that don't cry easily
49:19
or something but you feel really deeply um don't don't feel insecure because we're
49:26
just we're just different we're made different you know and we also have different seasons in our life we have
49:31
different seasons of where we're just crying a lot and it's a good and beautiful thing it's not a bad
49:37
thing it's a very tender time you know and then maybe there's Seasons where God is
49:42
really calling us to be walking in that Authority and be mature and strong and you were not
49:51
crying as much we have different seasons and they're all beautiful the the more crying or heavy heavier seasons are
49:57
beautiful and you know but it the the tears that come from Joy and compassion
50:03
and love are just beautiful period amen Isaiah 54 17 says no weapon formed
50:09
against us will prosper and every tongue that rises against us in judgment we shall condemn what does this mean
50:16
because Jesus tells us to bless our enemies things are different from the Old Testament and New Testament so New
50:22
Testament we are under the grace and there's just it went with Jesus coming with a New Covenant he's coming with
50:29
this new message you know we're no longer doing eye for eye anymore he comes with this new message of Grace I'm
50:34
having Grace on all of you I'm forgiving all of you this new Grace that wasn't there before but it's also a new Grace
50:40
that you also must give to others you also must give to your enemies you also must forgive your enemies and so
50:48
um there's principles that remain still what you sow you will reap what people
50:53
sow they will reap that's a principle that just stands
50:58
um and when it comes to talking against your anointed Servants of God
51:04
it is a very severe reaping like if you're speaking
51:09
against anointed Servants of God I mean God bringing his God moving on
51:16
this Earth because he chooses to use vessels so his movement on his on this Earth his
51:23
his way of saving his people and healing his people and delivering his people it's done primarily through people
51:29
through vessels so therefore this is why it is so
51:35
extremely serious to talk against Servants of God and I really it's a shame that more people
51:42
don't have this Revelation because they don't understand how much harm it brings upon themselves
51:47
you know many people don't have this revelation of that you shouldn't speak against anointed Servants of God because there
51:55
will be so much harm that comes upon you simply just the reaping that comes with that
52:00
um when you really have this Revelation you
52:05
will you'll never talk bad about anybody you definitely will not talk bad about any anointed servant of God
52:12
um you maybe you think you've seen funky things maybe you've seen fishy things
52:17
maybe you've seen bad fruits but you still won't say anything because
52:24
you don't need to say anything you know God hasn't called you to be the um
52:30
uh exposure and the one to speak and show the people what does good fruit and
52:35
what is bad fruit uh it is each believer's job to discern fruits and make their own decision of where they
52:42
will receive from it's our job to teach
52:47
people the truth to teach people this is what good fruits are this is what bad fruits are this is what true Doctrine is
52:54
this is false Doctrine it's our job it's it's fiful Minister's
53:00
job and just believer's job in general Accord depending on what God has called you to to share these truths to teach
53:06
these truths and then allow people to make their own decisions so it's not anybody's calling to be
53:15
speaking this this minister is is false in speaking
53:22
against because I mean you you don't want to mess with that you do not want to mess with that
53:28
you see how David would not even speak against Saul so you have solves today you have saws today that
53:36
are doing horrible things like how Saul did right trying to attack
53:41
um an anointed David right anointed Davids of today truly doing horrible things but
53:47
you see David still would not speak against him he says I will not speak against an anointed
53:54
servant of God he if anyone should be able to speak
53:59
against an anointed a former anointed because he he was formerly but still it was seen as
54:06
like I don't want to mess formerly it still like counts I don't even want to go there uh so it would be David but but
54:14
he didn't even do that so uh that just shows us if you have that
54:19
Revelation you will have the fear of God because just purely for the fact of you don't want to reap you do not want to
54:27
reap what comes with speaking against the servant of God so
54:33
so yeah um the the sewing and reaping is a real principle
54:39
so but but but it's not our job to
54:44
curse somebody it's not our job to induce reaping on somebody
54:50
that does harm to us so if someone does harm to you someone does bad things to
54:57
you speaks against you your job is to love them your job is to bless them and
55:02
you let the spiritual principles play their part in terms of bringing
55:08
Justice and you let God be the one to bring Justice
55:14
and like reveal the truth and fight the battle for you you let God do that
55:21
and I want to declare over all of you I declare
55:26
that you would be strengthened in the spirit you would be strong to be a warrior of
55:32
God that you wouldn't be lazy or wimpy or feel sorry for yourself but you would
55:40
be a strong warrior in the spirit I release this anointing upon you for
55:46
strength to come upon you for strength in the spirit that you would be this is what God is calling you to be mature
55:52
spiritually he is calling you Warriors to be mature spiritually to raise the
55:58
bar to go to the next level because of the work at hand because the work he's calling you to he needs you to be strong
56:06
to be more mature to push yourself in the spirit you know
56:13
be intentional be more intentional to be more mature to walk in maturity in the
56:19
spirit and reject those emotions reject from the devil reject those lies from the devil renew your mind of
56:27
the value of the anointing so God can use you more do more in your life for
56:33
his glory for his kingdom amen and I declare every demonic
56:38
oppression that is here right now I declare it all must be broken it all must go every
56:45
spiritual spouse must go every Spirit attacking your motives attacking your
56:50
heart your emotions attacking your feelings every impure sexual demon Every
56:56
Lie of the devil coming with impure thoughts and pure motivations impure
57:02

57:09
devil's attacks to discern the difference between the devil attacking and that it's not you that difference of
57:15
this is not me this is the dental attacking and I have Victory so may you walk in confidence may you walk never
57:22
feeling bad about yourself condemned but walk in confidence of who you are of
57:29
your identity and that you are victorious that you are a champion in Jesus name
