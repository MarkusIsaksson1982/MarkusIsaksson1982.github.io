do people receive a measure of power after they receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit how are there some miracles
0:07
happening when there hasn't been impartation so when it comes
0:14
to why miracles are happening through this person why are they happening through this person um it doesn't look
0:21
like this person has really received impartation how come miracles are happening through this person when we
0:27
come to this question this is a complex question this isn't um a a simple answer
0:33
there can be a lot of different reasons there can be a lot of different factors
0:38
um but I do want to answer it in just one like a a simple answer for now firs
0:44
of all it's important to understand that there are some topics where it it's just
0:49
it's mysteries of God it's it's it's beyond our understanding [Music]
0:55
um that's what you should know first of all so but what I how I want to share with you understanding of this
1:02
is God can do whatever he wants and God he cares about his people to be healed
1:08
to be freed more than anything and to be saved and to know his love that's what's most important to him and so he can
1:17
sometimes move in out of the box ways he can move in ways that are outside of his
1:23
principles um for example the when we see how people were healed and delivered
1:29
the most in the Bible pretty much I mean every example of someone receiving a miracle it's happening through a vessel
1:37
for the most part it's happening as a vessel of God is anointed and it's not just any vessel but it's a servant of
1:43
God it's one who has been anointed releases the power of God and
1:49
the miracles take place the example we have of apostle Peter um and apostle
1:55
Paul in the axe church this is where we are seeing many people be healed and
2:00
delivered so it's like if you want to see okay where where is their effectiveness in in in in believers
2:08
lives to see the kingdom of heaven released and people will be healed and delivered if you want to see that we
2:14
look in the Bible and we find these examples of Paul and Peter we find these examples you know in Acts 19:11 it said
2:20
God was doing such extraordinary miracles through the hands of Apostle Peter or Paul that that they
2:27
were bringing handkerchiefs and aprons to his skin and he was releasing the handkerchiefs and aprons to people touch
2:32
they would touch them and then the demons would go and the sickness would go so we see extraordinary and miracles
2:38
happening so quickly and easily we see the example of uh Peter and we see how people came underneath his shadow and
2:45
they were just all were healed and delivered simple there wasn't this struggle there wasn't this like long
2:52
one-on-one prayer line or something you know with with both of these examples we see it very simple and quickly and
2:58
effective and then what we see of both of these servants is that both of these
3:03
servants of God is that they were apostles they were um true leaders
3:08
appointed by God anointed by God they were vessels of God who truly carried
3:14
anointing and were truly called by God in this area of leadership and so we we
3:20
see now our example okay positioning people who are oppressed and sick under
3:28
where God's power is being released at the church where ministry is taking place this is the most effective time of
3:35
miracles taking place like this is where the highest level of anointing is released to make sure that even
3:40
principalities have to obey and the the toughest demonic cases have to go you
3:46
know and um this is where also the impartation of anointing is released to
3:51
the believers so that they may carry this same anointing and the level of anointing according to their calling and
3:59
according to their season in serving God so okay that's our biblical example
4:06
right so and and and and and that principle that we see of a God anointing
4:11
a servant anointing a servant and a leader and them releasing the power and miracles taking place very easily the
4:17
dead even being raised like in the Old Testament we see with Elijah and Elisha these mighty signs and wonders this
4:23
principle remains the same from Old Testament to New Testament this principle that I've just explained of
4:30
God anointing servants with putting powerful anointing in them that they then release to others that we see in
4:36
Peter and Paul in the New Testament it remains the same in the Old Testament as well so we can see this is God's
4:43
principle God's main way of releasing miracles to people is by having his kingdom of
4:51
kingdom government structure his church structure leadership structure putting
4:57
the highest level anointing there to then impart to others and to do the
5:02
greatest signs wonders and miracles like to do the most amount of miracles like we see Acts 19:11 extraordinary miracles
5:08
we see Peter's example it was specifically Peter we see where the most amount of miracles were taking place
5:13
where where the miracles were happening so effortlessly and easily okay so we see that's that's God's way that's his
5:21
principle that we can we can realize now this is his main we can see that this is his main way of releasing miracles um
5:29
okay so now we come to the point where sometimes we see miracles taking place
5:35
outside of that principle so the question is why is that happening how is that taking place so God can do whatever
5:42
he wants and um I you know he's not limited to that way but this is the main
5:49
way that he wants to move this is the way that he wants all of his people to adopt but because he loves his people so
5:56
much he he he can do whatever he wants he can move outside of that principle at
6:02
times but it doesn't change the fact that that's this is the main way he wants to do it um and like in a time of
6:10
where we are in where we've been in recently where many people do many people their eyes have not been opened
6:16
up to this these principles that I'm sharing many people's eyes in the body of Christ for many generations their
6:22
eyes have not been opened up to this way of God to this principle of God and
6:28
that's why by and large we see we don't we see miracles rare in the church today
6:34
but we don't see them absolute but we see them rare Um because God doesn't want to stray
6:42
from his word and be and like be manipulated and just like okay you want to have miracles h happen a different
6:48
way okay we'll do it your way because this is what you want that's not God so that's why by and large we don't see um
6:58
miracles taking place outside of God's principle but there is like outlier
7:05
situations and that's the the mis that's the mysterious part and that's also what
7:11
basically how we can summarize it as this is God's love this is God's love
7:16
and patience and mercy and grace for his people amen and so you know sometimes
7:22
people cry out in their room and they received a miracle there's many there's some people who um upon salvation they
7:31
were delivered from demons just like in their room like that testimony has taken place but that testimony is rare but God
7:38
we don't know but God knows the reason why he moved outside his main principle
7:44
main way of moving for that person maybe maybe he just knew that it had to take
7:49
place that that way or they would be lost you know maybe that in their
7:56
geographic location there or back then when there wasn't videos
8:02
um so easily at our fingertips to see God's power moving revival happening
8:08
maybe he knew that they wouldn't be exposed to his true ways and principles
8:15
they wouldn't be taught that and in order for their purpose in their life to
8:21
um go forward how it's supposed to be he needed them to be healed delivered in
8:27
that moment you see it's it's things like that that it's a mystery that it's like it's not like we know the exact
8:33
answer but we know God knows and it's for a purpose and I remember
8:40
like when I was set on fire for Jesus and was baptized in the Holy Spirit and I and I was so on fire for God and this
8:47
was like I think this was um this was like a little bit before I
8:52
met my spiritual father and I received the prophecy yeah it was a little bit
8:59
before and this is when my eyes opened up to how we should be praying with
9:06
authority and how we shouldn't be like saying God heal this person we should be saying be healed my eyes opened up to
9:14
that shortly before I met my spiritual father and received the prophecy over my life and I
9:21
was nanning a boy who was 12 years old and he was in a
9:27
his mother was was Jewish and was not open to Christianity at all um and it
9:34
didn't seem like he had any Christian influences in his life at all i do I don't believe and um I was his nanny and
9:41
I was working part-time as a nanny every day during the week and um I would spend
9:48
a lot of time with him i would pick him up from school i would drive him to um sports practices and things like this
9:55
and um so I would just talk with him sometimes
10:01
about God and one time all of a sudden he just got this pain in his mouth and
10:09
he was like all of a sudden out of nowhere he's in the car with me and I think it was like I don't know if it was his tongue or something but it was just
10:15
this sharp pain and he was like ow ow ow ow ow ow ow and I said what is like I
10:22
think his tongue I think hurts so bad and I said I just said something like be
10:27
healed this pain must go something like that in Jesus name and it immediately left the pain left him and all of a
10:33
sudden he had this shock look on his face like he was so shocked and um he he he
10:43
had faith since then like he it was shortly after then that I think it I
10:49
might have even been that day I forget but I um told him the gospel shared the
10:55
gospel with him and he he gave his life to Jesus um in word i I don't I mean I
11:03
don't know about his surrender from now but it it started out that way um back
11:10
then uh and um hallelujah and so uh anyways um that was
11:18
before I received impartation of anointing and that was I think pretty much I think that was the only miracle
11:24
I've seen God do through me of course that was I hadn't prayed for many people back then um I mean it was a short span
11:31
of time before um knowing how to pray you know and and then
11:37
um meeting my spiritual father and receiving the prophecy over my life but that was just like one example I give
11:43
for you and I and I you can see how like in that moment God really wanted to
11:49
touch him so you know he could use me in that way but in that moment it wasn't
11:55
really uh the anointing in me at that moment
12:01
really but it was just God and faith and you know um and
12:08
so miracles like this can take place but it's it's really outside of this
12:16
principle of of the anointing because when when you have received impartation
12:21
from anointing of anointing um it's it's like God has given you
12:27
power and he's given you a higher level of authority we all have different measures of authority uh different
12:34
levels of we all have a measure of authority when you give your life to Jesus and the main um authority that we
12:41
have is authority over our own spiritual life so like when the enemy comes attacking us in the mind or something we
12:48
can reject these lies and he has to obey that authority but then as we surrender
12:54
to Jesus and receive impartation of anointing that authority increases in us so then we can pray for people and the
13:01
demons it's the authority increases and the anointing increases which are the same the anointing is the power but the
13:08
power also carries authority just like and I share this this example in my book if you haven't read it yet i go more in
13:14
depth on this for your understanding but um it's like the president when the president becomes president he he has
13:20
the he's given the power of the president and so he has authority and
13:26
power they're like two in one and so he has the authority to you know say "I'm
13:32
going to send the National Guard to this um uh n uh national emergency that's
13:39
taking place you know um uh a natural disaster that has taken place and so he
13:45
has the authority to do that and then he has he has the the powers so he has an
13:52
he has he has an army that can that can enforce th this like the help that's
13:59
needed and or if it's war if it was a war or something a battle you send the army so you have the the weapons the
14:06
power to enforce what you have the authority to do you know so it's like
14:13
two in one power and authority so it's anointing and authority anointing carries authority in it but they're also
14:20
like two things right so um so when when God releases impartation of anointing to
14:27
you your authority also increases and so at that point you are
14:32
really walking in dominion on this earth like we were called to be like we were called to and so it's like it's like you
14:41
can have this assurance that like I pray for this and this must take place you know like this mountain must move jesus
14:49
says this specifically to the to the believers i mean to the disciples who were anoint who carried anointing and
14:54
authority he says when you speak to the mountains and you believe what you speak will happen the mountain will move it's
15:02
like why because you've given you've been given power and authority and so um
15:09
when you really carry this anointing and authority like like for me like when I pray it's like I I I don't have this
15:16
wondering like I wonder like if it happened or not like I I know God did a
15:21
miracle that's why when every time I um am praying on a like the live stream or
15:30
a service I'm like receive this like these miracles
15:35
happened you you didn't feel anything maybe but I know they happened now it's up to you to receive it so like I know
15:42
that when I pray I know that God really is doing miracles and will the miracles
15:49
manifest or not that's up to the person to have faith to really accept and grab
15:54
and value what has been released but it's a matter of pr it's a matter of
16:01
like spiritual of spiritual laws you know it's very like it's very simple
16:06
it's like it's like how Jesus h you know this demon the some of the the the
16:13
apostles they couldn't cast out this demon out of some kid some boy and
16:19
um but Jesus was able to but Jesus actually kind of reprimands a little
16:25
kind of reprimands or corrects um the disciples saying you know you need to have faith more faith and you need to
16:31
pray and fast but I also shared this more in depth in my book but the real meaning of praying and fasting wasn't
16:37
this like ritual to achieve anointing but he really to summarize praying and
16:44
fasting simply means to be less carnal and more spiritual the main the main
16:50
definition meaning of fasting is to
16:55
um abstain from an area in your life where your flesh is strong so that means
17:02
that like once you grow spiritually it might it once you once you have grown
17:07
spiritually so much and the flesh has been pushed down so much you aren't
17:13
going to have to be like constantly fasting actually um in this kind of way okay i mean God
17:20
can God calls sometimes a time of fasting food but that should just be spiritled not to achieve something or
17:26
not something out of ritual or not something like I really want this to happen and it hasn't happened yet i'm
17:32
going to fast so I can manipulate God that's like what people do without
17:38
knowing it when they fast many times um but so anyways when it comes to the main
17:43
way of fasting that God is talking about um his ma like the main definition of
17:49
fasting spiritually is to abstain from an an area of the flesh that is strong
17:56
so what happens when you're transformed more into the image of Christ is that the flesh dies like you're literally
18:02
transformed the flesh dies like you you don't that's when you all of a sudden
18:08
don't have an appetite of things that you used to have an appetite for and if you keep seeking Jesus every day and you
18:15
are diligent to keep every door shut and you are diligent to keep being after the father's heart every
18:24
day you aren't going to go backwards you're going to remain changed you know
18:29
it's not like um you know you used to have to fast something you used to have
18:35
to fast like maybe social media or something you used to have to fast that but then God transformed you and now you
18:41
don't have an appetite for social media anymore um but you are on social media
18:46
but in a good way like it's not like you got rid of it completely but you're you're on social media in a good way
18:52
like to be the light of the world um it's not like you're like "Okay I have
18:57
to fast this once a month once a year and not be on it at all." It It's not
19:03
like that like once you've really been transformed you don't have to be in this
19:08
repeating cycle of it's not like "Oh the flesh is going to come back by the end of the month now got to fast now." Like
19:15
once you're transformed you are transformed hallelujah and so um that's
19:21
the main meaning of fasting and many people think it's like this ritual this performance this
19:28
um proving to God how you can sacrifice for him you know is out of performance
19:37
you know not being led by the Holy Spirit not with a purpose but out of performance
19:44
and then God puts anointing on because you've abstained from eating and you're
19:50
so amazing spiritually that you make this sacrifice you know like many times people are caught up with that but yet
19:56
they're not sacrificing financially to the kingdom which is where God actually wants them to be sacrificing in and
20:02
there's a great purpose for that sacrifice you know like for his kingdom to advance number one and number two so
20:08
that money can have absolutely no hold on you anymore but yet people are fasting their food and that that's a
20:16
meaning of obedience is better than sacrifice so sometimes God is wanting you to
20:22
sacrifice something else but to be obedient in sacrificing this rather than just making this um performance
20:29
sacrifice you know like for Saul Saul um he he when we see the scripture
20:38
obedience is better than sacrifice it's because it it's when Saul was you know
20:45
he was leading a battle leading his army into battle and they would always um you
20:54
know it was in the word to make sacrifices sacrifice animals the best
21:00
animals sac make a sacrifice to the Lord like after the battle like uh if there's
21:05
animals that you've gotten I forget the word but as uh I'm forgetting the word now but
21:11
the the you defeated the enemies and you get to take their animals and stuff you
21:16
you make a sacrifice of like the best animals to the Lord like this is this was this law
21:23
this was this ritual that God commanded and they would do it like in rituals and
21:31
um and because like it was looked good upon you to do these rituals
21:41
um by people uh what happened was God commanded Saul through prophet
21:51
Samuel actually for this battle I want you to kill everything i don't want you to leave anything alive to make a
21:57
sacrifice like you usually do kill every person and every animal everything i'm just he was testing him he was just
22:04
simply commanding him i want you to obey me in this you don't understand it but I just want you to obey me i want to see
22:09
if you are really after my heart um but you know the the people in battle with
22:16
Saul wouldn't understand that and to them it looked like he was being like
22:22
not godly if he were to go against this law and tradition and ritual of making
22:29
this sacrifice and so he chose to obey
22:35
or obey i mean he chose to please people instead of please God in this moment and
22:41
so he disobeyed God he did not do what God asked him to do through prophet Sam Samuel and he kept these um animals
22:48
alive to make sacrifices to God and he lost the anointing because of that he
22:56
lost his calling he lost his position of king as king of Israel because of this
23:04
because he did the the thing that people looked good upon as being
23:12
godly he made a sacrifice that wasn't pleasing to God a godly looking
23:18
sacrifice um instead of obeying God so
23:25
um you know that's that's the meaning obedience is better than sacrifice and
23:30
so God wanted him to actually still make a sacrifice but to make the sacrifice of
23:36
uh his ego to make a sacrifice of people not understanding him
23:45
and not being pleased with him and looking down upon him god was asking him to make that
23:52
sacrifice in obedience but instead he made the ritual sacrifice so that's the
23:58
meaning of that scripture your ritual sacrifices obedience is better than your ritual sacrifices that look godly but
24:07
actually are are just ritual sacrifices so when Jesus said um you need to fast
24:14
and pray to cast out this demon he wasn't talking about doing this religious ritual sacrifice to perform
24:21
something to then obtain anointing he was talking about they still had areas
24:28
of their flesh that were high still they needed to be fasting these things so that they could be transformed
24:35
more into the image of God and so that they could live more surrendered so that God could then entrust them with more
24:42
anointing with a higher level anointing to deal with higher level demons like we're in this boy
24:49
so he wasn't talking about like in order to cast out high level demons you got to be continually doing this religious um
24:59
fasting thing he was saying you need to deny your flesh and and the part of
25:05
prayer is the real meaning of prayer is intimacy with God and being after God's heart every day being naked before God
25:14
rather than because you know it's so funny people can read this scripture completely wrong way like prayer and
25:21
fasting they can take it as meaning you need to pray for two hours in your closet and or in your room and um fast
25:30
food in a religious manner in a in a in a ritual
25:36
manner when okay so there's people out there that are doing these things and they're thinking they're so spiritual
25:41
and they're thinking they're going to obtain they're going to receive anointing but this is the reality of their of their life this is the reality
25:47
of their prayer life they pray for two hours in their rooms but they are
25:53
hypocrites just just like Jesus talks about the Pharisees how they are hypocrites how outwardly they look
25:59
beautiful but on the in inwardly they are ugly they are dirty um so outwardly
26:07
they're saying "Praise you Lord i praise you Jesus i praise you." And God do praying
26:13
praying all these these things for two hours and um these religious prayers and then and
26:22
then they're fasting but the reality of their prayer life is for two hours they're in their their room praying
26:28
appearing so godly um wow they pray for two hours every day wow but throughout
26:36
their days they're living another life they are being judgmental they are being
26:42
prideful and they are sinning in other areas maybe and um they are doing things
26:50
with impure motives and they are leaving God in their room and and not taking God
26:59
with them throughout their days they are not being naked before God and allowing
27:05
God to look in their heart and judge their heart and clean their heart throughout their days this is the state
27:11
of many Christians this is the state of every Pharisee this is the state of these Christians who
27:19
um don't carry the fruits of Christ you know this is why it's because they're
27:25
living a double life they're um they are doing these outward great things godly
27:33
things but inwardly their prayer life is is is is fake and their prayer life
27:42
is an hour or two hours with God but it's not even real it's like lofty
27:48
religious fake prayers that aren't genuine um and in a ritual manner and
27:53
then they're going about their days and they're not they're like leaving God there instead of bringing God with them
27:58
and that's how they they they're able to even live this way without a conscience
28:05
you know what I mean because when you bring God with you like when you want God to see you and you know like you
28:10
know like you're like you know you have this awareness like God can see me and I want to please him and I want to be in his will and I I don't want to do
28:17
anything to ever displease him when you live that way you're you're in intimacy with God that's the action of you
28:24
inviting him in inviting him to be with you every second inviting him in the
28:30
inside of you in the in your heart to judge you like to judge i mean to like
28:36
um like look and like Lord is there like anything impure help me i don't want it
28:41
here i don't want it here so like see it convict me help me don't let me miss
28:47
this you know um so yeah that's the real meaning of
28:53
prayer is intimacy with God and not fake prayer but bringing God with you everywhere and living every day with
29:01
this awareness that he's with you he sees everything and you want him to see everything and you're inviting him to
29:07
help you live Christlike every day so sometimes that's even just in like your
29:12
thoughts and just your awareness that can be like a form of prayer because you're you are you're wanting him there
29:21
you know it's like you're it's intimacy it's like it's like God's in the room
29:26
right now like acknowledging God in the room right like looking at him and smiling at him rather than like um
29:35
ignoring him like if he's sitting in the corner and you're just like it's like
29:41
he's it's like you are choosing to believe he's not there kind of thing and you're just like going around the room
29:47
not not acknowledging him even one time um you see how it's like intimacy versus
29:53
not intimacy and that's just in the form of thoughts right so anyways that's the
29:59
meaning of what so Jesus says of so prayer and fasting and faith are what was missing from the disciples at that
30:05
point and really what was missing was full surrender they were growing it's
30:11
not like um it's just that in this point in the scripture they were just in a point of
30:17
growing they were not in that point of full maturity at the time that they were
30:23
when the book of Acts happens and the church begins and they receive the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit to help them so
30:30
um at this time they needed to be more surrendered to Jesus be more obedient deny their flesh more which included
30:37
fasting be more intimate with God including God everywhere in their lives being more intimate and also having more
30:45
faith those were the things that were missing why they couldn't cast out the demon but the reason they couldn't cast
30:51
out the demon was because God wasn't going to release a higher level anointing until they did these things until they um live more surrendered and
30:59
lifted their faith so anyways um so
31:05
like once you carry this anointing and authority you know it's like Jesus is
31:11
like I know this will go and he wants this he wants it to be this way for us he as like I know this demon will go
31:16
it's not like will the father c cast a demon out through me there's no question
31:22
you know Jesus was like kind of reprimanding them saying like you need to have more faith you should have been
31:27
able to do this so it's it's very simple like the works of the devil must be destroyed god
31:33
wants to destroy the works of the devil through his servants who carry anointing when you carry anointing the works of the devil have to be destroyed
31:41
that's why we have so much expectancy and excitement um and faith for every time we have a
31:49
service at 5F church we have a conference especially we have a live
31:55
stream that's why because it's not like this like I wonder if God will show up i
32:02
wonder if he will do miracles it's that it's the Bible come
32:08
alive where all who came under the shadow of Peter who were sick and oppressed all
32:15
were healed why because God just decided that day to heal all no because this is
32:21
God's principle this is God's ways when you carry true anointing and authority the works of the devil have to
32:29
be destroyed the devil can't stay demons can't stay sickness can't stay
32:34
hallelujah so when you this is a this is like a whole sermon that answer this question so when you receive impartation
32:42
when you receive anointing and authority you're going to be walking well depending on your calling but if you are
32:49
anointed to be like an apostle like how uh Peter and Paul was if your calling is
32:54
similar to that your ministry will look like Peter and Paul's it will be like this effective it will be like so many
33:02
miracles taking place okay so that's the difference between
33:07
that person and a person who who does not carry the anointing and authority
33:14
miracles may happen sometimes but it is not the effectiveness like this that we are
33:21
talking so that is the difference that is the difference and the miracles happening from time to time
33:28
is having to do with God just wanting to heal this person and God just wanting to touch this person for God's purposes for
33:34
his love he just needs to touch this person right now and this person has faith and he he does it right
33:41
there you know so that's why Hallelujah how do we know if we have
33:47
been baptized in the Holy Spirit or not is it possible to not feel anything in the moment yes um for any miracle to take
33:55
place there there's never a requirement of a feeling in the Bible the Bible
34:00
never speaks on for healing for deliverance for baptism of the Holy Spirit to take
34:07
place um there has to be this physical feeling
34:13
it it never speaks of that and I've seen just huge drastic miracles
34:20
take place in people's lives without any kind of physical feeling so it is
34:27
important to really separate the physical feelings with trying to figure out if you have
34:35
received a miracle have received the baptism of the Holy Spirit it's very important to just like get that out of
34:40
the way when you what's important when it comes to the baptism of the Holy Spirit the the biblical examples we have
34:46
this is this goes along with receiving miracles like what I was just sharing the main way that God releases the
34:51
baptism of the Holy Spirit is through servants of God that's what we see um in the book of Acts there's a couple
34:57
different examples of uh Peter was preaching to the crowd one time he was just preaching and as he was preaching
35:02
the Holy Spirit fell on people they started speaking in tongues they were baptized in the Holy Spirit just in the middle of the sermon another time the
35:08
apostles were laying hands on people more than once they were laying hands on the people and then they were baptized
35:14
in the Holy Spirit and they began speaking in tongues so um people can be baptized in the Holy Spirit without a
35:19
servant of God but this is the biblical example we see this is like this is the main principal way that it takes place
35:25
so if you are not sure if you're baptiz Holy Spirit before
35:30
um I would what what we should do is have this desire and faith and
35:37
expectancy to receive the fire of the Holy Spirit more of God instead of like
35:43
trying to figure out or not just have that heart and faith and expectancy god I want more of you and maybe you've seen
35:49
other people that seem to maybe you don't have the maybe you've never spoken in tongues but you see people speaking
35:55
in tonesues you know have that faith and desire i want more it looks like they have more i want more i I want more i
36:03
believe there's more that I don't have yet and I want more and I believe you will release it to me God and it's
36:09
important you have that faith of the power of God the anointing so when you come in person to where God's power is
36:15
or when you're on a live stream like this and the anointing's being released anything can happen at that time it
36:21
doesn't have to be like I it it's not like I for example have to say I baptize you in the Holy Spirit i've released the
36:28
fire of the Holy Spirit and then you will bapti be baptized no when the anointing is truly present and it's
36:35
being released any miracle can take place and God knows what his people need
36:41
god knows what you need so um and I mean like this happens sometimes a lot like
36:47
when sometimes when I um when when I'm praying for someone and
36:52
commanding a demon to leave them a demon will leave them and sometimes they'll immediately just start speaking in tongues like the baptism of the Holy
36:58
Spirit just came upon them without me having to say specifically I baptizing Holy Spirit fire of the Holy Spirit come
37:05
and start speaking in tongues or something to try to get the the fire to come no like when the anointing is
37:11
present it is so powerful and God is just releasing miracles he's just releasing his fire he's just doing what
37:17
he wants to do uh so you know what's what's the most important thing to do is
37:24
to when when you position yourself where God's power is being released have faith
37:30
and expectancy to receive more and maybe you're specifically desiring hungering i
37:36
want more fire i want the gift of tongues i want that activated in me maybe you've been baptized in the Holy
37:42
Spirit but you haven't spoken in tongues yet i want that activated in me so come with that faith and then God
37:49
sees that faith faith is the currency of heaven like faith there there's a transaction with
37:56
faith like if you have faith you will receive more like it's very important
38:03
faith is very very very very very important um so you you need but faith
38:08
is a choice you know it's not a feeling that's why I'm saying like decide like I want more and I believe in your
38:14
anointing and I believe I will receive more as I position myself where the anointing is um you know at last year's
38:23
flourish conference there was something great
38:28
that God did where he just instilled faith through prophetic words that he
38:34
spoke uh about the conference coming up he he
38:39
instilled faith through the power of the prophetic he increased faith um and so a
38:48
big reason why the power of God moves so mightily it was two parts number one at
38:54
last year's flourish conference number one it was because this was this divine
38:59
appointment that God had orchestrated and planned to do this
39:05
but what people received wasn't based fully on this divine appointment it was
39:11
based also on their faith
39:16
and there could be some people that didn't come with faith and maybe they didn't receive much because of their
39:23
choice but there were so many people who and I don't know i'm just saying that
39:28
like that could be but there were so many people who came with such faith and
39:35
once again faith is a choice like it's God has spoken this i believe in the
39:40
prophets i believe in the prophetic word spoken i believe in his servants his servants have spoken this word from him
39:47
and this is God really speaking and God is going to show up like never before and so I am excited i am expectant god
39:56
is going to move like that's all a choice that's nothing to do with a feeling you know like that's choosing to
40:02
believe the word and choosing to believe God that he does what he says he's going
40:08
to do is nothing to do with feelings sometimes you know feelings can impact
40:16
people and so sometimes they're really feeling it and they do have more faith but it doesn't you don't you're not
40:21
supposed to let the feelings dictate you know so
40:26
anyways there was so many people at last year's Flourish Conference at last year's LA conference flourish that came
40:33
with a higher faith than ever and so this was the second reason the second
40:39
part of the reason why God moved so extraordinarily last year
40:46
um because there was that partnership with God the the the the part bringing
40:51
the faith meeting God with faith with his prophetic word and appointment
40:58
and desire and intention to release so it it's meeting God like
41:04
halfway you know um and and so that's that's the reason that's that's the
41:10
reason so um it's so much in our hands it's so
41:16
much in our hands a lot of people are like "How do I receive this like I don't I don't know how come I'm seeing other
41:22
people receive this and I'm not It's so much more simple it It's so
41:28
I mean it's simp it's like stop all of this stop all of this and just be a child just be like a child and say "I
41:36
want what they have god loves me like they love like God loves them i'm going to receive like they've
41:42
received because I'm going to do what they did i'm going to go where God's power is i'm going to use apply the
41:48
principles that they have applied i'm going to choose to believe and I'm going to receive like very simple ch
41:56
that you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven unless you become like a child that's what the Bible says this is
42:04
a revelation of that so um yeah it a lot of people are trying to figure out do I
42:10
have this am I fully delivered do I have the baptism of the Holy Spirit do I need to do something else to get tongues like
42:16
it's it's over complicating things forget all of it be like a child choose
42:22
to believe lift your faith and God can touch you any time like God God can
42:27
touch you any like revival is revival is now events too
42:33
like it it's like it's so powerful how God moves revival but it's not it's not like God's
42:39
like "Okay I'm only going to move the most powerfully at events." You know
42:46
it's the faith that meets God there so we have the we have such we have the
42:52
power to make God be glorified more to make
42:58
his spirit rest upon us greater like to do more miracles like God is ready to
43:03
raise the dead he's ready to do creative miracles he's ready to do open up blind
43:09
eyes open up deaf ears like God is ready to do it now like really right it's not
43:14
a matter of we need more anointing that's sometimes the case but that like prophetically prophetically like in this
43:20
move of God in this revival that's not the case we don't need to pray for more anointing we don't need to God is ready
43:28
he is waiting for his people to lift their faith to to to come to a higher
43:34
standard of faith and expectancy and hunger for him i think
43:39
that I need to preach more on Sunday on this because I see this coming this
43:49
coming weekend God's God's intention and and plan to move mightily but we have to
43:57
do our part you have to do your part you know individually for yourself upon upon what you will receive and
44:04
collectively for everyone like because it's a domino effect that's what's so exciting about um the power of of of
44:11
faith is that like just just your faith your faith
44:17
can instantly inspire others to have more faith your faith that leads to a miracle is the testimony the testimony
44:23
of Jesus is a spirit of prophecy so the testimony of the miracle happening in your life because you
44:29
believed is prophesying of that miracle to another person because now they have faith
44:35
because they have faith because what God did in your life but also because the faith you had that's power that's so
44:41
exciting what this should in inspire us all inspire you all to choose to lift
44:49
your faith more hallelujah
44:55
this is why the Bible says you cannot please God without faith you cannot please God without
45:00
faith because this is needed this is what is needed for God to do exactly
45:06
what he wants and I
45:13
have in my new book Unlock Your Deliverance I have two chapters on faith
45:20
describing what faith is because a lot of people don't understand what faith is i've talked a lot a lot about right now and also how to actually obtain faith i
45:28
see someone asking a question what is your um what is your advice to help others have
45:34
faith chapter six how to activate faith how to activate I have I I speak
45:41
so in depth on this and I'm so excited about these chapters i believe these chapters alone are going to help every
45:47
believer to be able to receive more from God because they they've wanted to have faith but they haven't been able to have
45:53
faith because they didn't have the revelation of what faith is and how to actually have faith and more
46:00
faith what is the best way to remember the
46:10
teachings so well the first thing I would say is to take inventory on your
46:17
life look around and is there anything in your life that
46:23
is that you're filling yourself with that's making it so there's not enough room for the word of
46:30
God because you if you're putting the word
46:38
of God in and then you're putting other things in it's it's not going to let the
46:44
word of God stay and grow and so what we want to do is to be pure vessels and
46:49
keep every door shut to the enemy and not allow any negative word any
46:56
um any darkness from the enemy come in
47:04
and stay in our minds and stay in our hearts because that's replacing the word
47:10
of God because you know you can't be thinking at two of two things at the
47:16
same time right so you can be thinking about God you can think be thinking about his word and as you're thinking of
47:23
that you cannot be thinking about anything else and as you think about it it
47:29
becomes more deeper in you and it you retain it and you remember it and it
47:35
transforms you so the Bible talks about meditating on the word of God day and
47:41
night it's very important to be to be keeping this word in you meditating on
47:46
it um making the intention to meditate on it so when you hear a teaching you should write notes you can
47:54
do it different ways maybe the first time you just want to listen like because if you're writing notes maybe you can't really hear the next thing
47:59
that's being said so maybe the first time I'm not saying like everybody do it this way do it however it works for you
48:04
you can do it different ways you can you know but maybe the first time just listen without taking notes or jot down
48:10
something here and there slightly maybe but then the second time listen and take down notes you know and then return to
48:17
the notes and return to the teaching listen to the teaching again um make a note of maybe there's a teaching that
48:24
you really needed like maybe a teaching was more of a strength for you maybe um
48:30
like as you heard it it it was more of just like a good
48:36
reminder but then maybe there's other teachings that like spoke upon your weakness it
48:44
brought conviction it led you to repentance it really opened your eyes in
48:49
a new way it really like it was a desperate need this teaching maybe make sure you really
48:56
write that down and highlight it so you can grow because if you just listen to it one time it might not do too much i
49:03
mean it it can it'll do a little bit but like if it's a weakness in your life if something's a weakness in your life it's
49:10
like you don't go to the gym one day for a weakness like for a tiny muscle to get
49:17
a bigger muscle right so if there's a weakness in your life um you got to
49:23
focus on that more right so you got to renew your mind with that more especially because if it's a lie of the
49:29
enemy he's like he know he he he studies people and he knows oh this is a weakness you know
49:35
so he can try attacking more in that area so you got to combat that attacking
49:41
with that word more with the word that combats what the enemy is saying more
49:48
often so um like whenever something whenever you
49:54
if you ever have a weakness in your life or you know you hear something you're like I need this really take note of
50:03
that return to it often um and return to all the teachings but I'm just saying
50:09
like make sure you you you take this as food that you need like it's like medicine like I can't forget this
50:16
medicine you know um and oh I have this certain weakness in my body i really
50:21
can't forget this type of medicine but I also need to take these vitamins here too right so you you have to
50:29
um you know value all of the teachings but just like have that shift in your
50:37
mind of seeing them as so like so serious so precious so valuable that you
50:43
need them that you don't want to forget them that you don't want to ever get in a routine of just
50:48
um listening to the message and that's it like just listen to the message and then go about life like be a student be
50:54
a disciple disciple means student so be a student of the teachings don't be a listener don't just don't just be a
51:00
listener listen but don't just be a listener don't just be an attendee of church don't just be an attendee of a
51:06
live be a student amen and um also just don't you
51:14
don't don't don't feel over don't you don't feel like you need to be overwhelmed because um the Bible says to meditate on the
51:21
word of God day and night so whenever you're hearing teachings you're meditating on the word of God day and
51:27
night you know it can feel that scripture could be daunting meditate on the word of God day and
51:33
night but it's not daunting it just means continually putting your eyes and
51:39
your ears to God's word to his written word and to his spoken word teachings
51:46
so never feel overwhelmed because this constant hearing the word is what you're
51:52
supposed to be doing so you don't need to feel like you need to memorize every single word or something um but do
52:01
memorize the ones that really you know is important too you know you need this
52:06
to grow you know you need this to have victory over the enemy when we unknowingly open a door
52:13
does that give the the enemy legal right to come with a repetitive bombarding lie
52:18
until we repent yeah i mean it's not like
52:23
a it's not like a one-sizefits-all answer for this one um for one God has
52:30
so much grace and so we'll see our gra his grace operate in so many areas of our lives like when you are surrendered
52:38
to God and you are really doing your best and you really are after his heart
52:44
like he has such grace and understanding when um maybe you you unknowingly open up a
52:52
door you know he has such grace and he has such mercy hallelujah
52:59
but um at the same time there are spiritual laws and principles and so
53:05
sometimes um you know it's it's important to like
53:11
realize oh I open this door I have to close this door have to make the take the steps necessary to really close the
53:19
store to repent um and just to do everything God is asking make sacrifice to him perhaps you
53:27
know um so you know the Bible says my people
53:32
perish because of lack of knowledge but you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free so this also applies
53:39
to this circumstance so maybe you you you you had a lack of knowledge in an
53:45
area and because of that an open door happened and the enemy
53:52
had access then but now but God in his mercy and his grace revealed to you this
53:59
was actually opening up a door so you know the truth and now the truth shall set you free so now you can repent you
54:06
can renounce you can close the door and do anything God is asking you to to
54:13
um be protected from the
54:19
enemy how do I know when public repentance is necessary like making a video of myself repenting and saying
54:25
sorry to those who I might have hurt in the past um generally generally it is
54:35
mostly private repentance that these should things should be taking place like if you did wrong to a
54:43
person you would just go to them in person and apologize um that's generally the main
54:51
way uh it does not need to be public um
54:56
there's just not a need for it it's just something that should be between the two of you unless there unless you have done
55:05
unless a person has done something if a person has done something um wrongly to
55:11
another that that caused like if a person said a false accusation about
55:17
another person if a person did something to cause people to think wrongly about a
55:26
person then it is not true
55:32
repentance unless you the person repents
55:37
publicly and the person apologizes publicly and the person sets the record
55:43
straight and um you know this happens in two ministers so often this hap because
55:49
of jealousy because of competition um selfish motives
55:56
pride ego because of all this that takes place in um the body of Christ today
56:03
unfortunately just as it did in the times of Jesus with the Pharisees there are ministers there are
56:11
people with platforms that make up things that lie against another servant
56:16
of God that just quickly take um lies and and and don't hear the other
56:24
person's side of the story and just re regurgitate them there are people that
56:31
make videos like this there are people that say things that cause people to to
56:38
look skeptically and bad towards another even if it's
56:44
something cryptic that someone writes or speaks but that influence causes people
56:51
to look badly towards another uh minister um and what this person spoke I
57:00
is is is is judgmental is not their place and is wrong
57:08
that repentance has to be public to be counted as true repentance or else that
57:13
is not real repentance and we are accounted for everything that we do the
57:21
words that we speak i mean when we actually repent God wipes away the sins
57:26
god forgives us when we don't actually repent that's not taking place so that's a really serious matter and we don't see
57:33
this happening a lot this this this true repentance that needs to be public
57:40
because when when when damage has been caused towards a person
57:46
unjustly especially if it's a if it's a minister that's a lot of people not
57:52
coming and receiving what God wanted them to receive at that ministry that is
57:58
that is lasting damage until the person apologize
58:05
apologizes so it's like if you if you let that stay it's
58:11
like it's like you were being a person was being used by the enemy to harm
58:17
God's people to prevent people from receiving from God what he wanted them to receive to receive freedom to receive
58:23
the new wine to receive anointing and those works of the devil are just
58:29
like remaining and it's up to that person to somewhat
58:37
fix their contribution to the enemy to to the enemy's kingdom the contribution
58:43
to um hurting God's kingdom it's up to that person and that's the only way that
58:51
damage can be um uh uh restored
58:59
removed somewhat uh is is in that
59:08
way i mean that's the only way that like it's counted as true repentance where
59:16
that sin is wiped away it that's how it is um and so you know it's rare to see
59:23
that but I pray that people would have the fear of God and would do what is
59:29
right and would truly
59:37
repent it's wisdom to share testimony in a way where you don't have to share all
59:42
the details i mean there can be a time where it's okay it's with wisdom and sharing details is okay but with this
59:48
complexity there's a way to still give God glory and um share fully what he
59:55
did in a way that's more obscure in the areas of the exact details and names of
1:00:03
people and the exact things they did you know what I mean there's a way to say there was immense evil done to me
1:00:10
towards a person from a person who had done crimes and like you can say it in a
1:00:16
way like that that's without like revealing the actual person that would
1:00:22
be a wise way to sh an example of a wise way to share a testimony a lot of people wonder about this like can I share my
1:00:29
full testimony you can there's a way to share like totally what God did without
1:00:35
having to say the exact specific details that specifically may
1:00:43
bring judgment towards another person type thing or the enemy could use to um
1:00:50
bring unnecessary attacks towards you from that person you know there's a way to still give God glory and really even
1:00:57
explain the the deliverance the healing the miracles that God did um without having to share like every
1:01:04
little detail does that make sense so that's how you should be all sharing your testimonies where you don't have to feel like you oh I'm withholding some of
1:01:12
the truth because I'm not saying the name of the person or the title or you you see what I'm saying um no you it's
1:01:19
important you share testimonies with with wisdom to not be afraid but to just
1:01:24
simply invite Holy Spirit in to help you share with wisdom like even in my testimonies if I
1:01:31
share about how I received persecution if a person attacked me I'm like sensitive to not like reveal all these I
1:01:38
don't want to like paint this picture like so everyone could look down upon the person even if they like deserve it
1:01:45
you know like I am careful to just like
1:01:50
truthfully share my testimony but not having to disclose every detail to that
1:01:55
would then make people know exactly who I'm talking about so that they could
1:02:01
think badly about the person you see what I'm saying um I it's with wisdom so
1:02:08
that you you aren't unnecessarily causing people to
1:02:17
um judge another person and think bad about another person um even if the person's like guilty you know but the
1:02:25
point of a testimony should be glory to God and increase in faith a point of testimony there shouldn't be residuals
1:02:31
in the testimony that make a person um hateful and judgmental about another
1:02:38
person so if things are like inevitable like that it's not like you have to be like I just can't share my testimony
1:02:44
then because people will probably figure out who I'm talking about like like even for me like if I share my testimony like
1:02:50
when I'm talking about like persecution I've gone through like people probably know like the story probably you know
1:02:55
the details it doesn't mean I just oh I can't ever talk about the testimony because possibly a person may think like
1:03:02
oh that person attacked her Apostle Katherine wrongly like I I I I I can't
1:03:08
be thinking like that or else I'm not going to be sharing my testimony and encouraging people it's just like doing
1:03:14
our best to you know
1:03:19
not to speak in wisdom so that it's nothing but love and peacefulness and
1:03:26
grace poured out um rather than unnecessarily having
1:03:31
people look towards someone in a in a negative like judgmental hateful
1:03:38
way god has moved so powerfully on this live today hasn't he thank you Jesus for your presence i want to pray over all of
