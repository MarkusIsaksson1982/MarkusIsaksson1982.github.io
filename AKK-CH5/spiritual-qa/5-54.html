if you don't sense an addiction then you don't need to really worry about it
0:05
because sometimes we can get so religious like
0:11
like being so so hyper sensitive like about perfection and
0:19
about like we're we're living on this world and we are called to bring heaven on
0:25
this earth but sometimes we can forget that we are human um and it's okay that
0:32
we live in this world you know like sometimes we can forget you know it's if
0:39
you don't have seven eight nine hours of sleep you may feel tired and even when you have the Holy Spirit in you like
0:46
that's not some that's not like something's wrong with you but what I found is like if I have something to do
0:53
for God if I have a task to do and I haven't gotten much sleep because of I wasn't able to for whatever reason but I
1:00
have a task to do I have to minister or something I find that the Holy Spirit gives me energy to do that task I find
1:08
that he always comes through and gives me supernatural strength um but like if
1:14
I don't have a specific task like ministry like where where where it's very important for me to like be very
1:22
energetic you know maybe even it's doing the work of God that doesn't require like preaching but it's just like
1:29
something with maybe social media or if it was like editing for example um those
1:34
types of things like you don't have to feel really energetic to do and to still do and to still do with excellence
1:42
you know so like you can feel tired but still be able to do things with excellence and that's okay and um
1:49
sometimes we can just like forget that we're living on this in this world and
1:54
we can be so focused on like perfectionism um when like you know we are humans that
2:01
live on this body so to like experience like tiredness sometimes because of like not getting enough sleep is just like a
2:08
normal thing you know but the the the the powerful thing is that when we need to do something for God that requires
2:14
energy we can believe that God will give us the strength and energy and we can trust that he will come through and
2:20
empower us and fill us with the with with that energy um but that's about it
2:26
like we don't need to be thinking about it so much like
2:32
um you know like expecting to be full of energy all the time and get down on
2:38
ourselves if we're not feeling that way due to lack of sleep for example um so
2:44
yeah I mean things like things like sugar and coffee
2:50
um and like other types of food that aren't very nutritional that's all fine
2:55
to do in moderation and like like okay like dessert you will you can eat
3:01
dessert and you can feel like wow that tastes good like that has a certain effect on you and that's fine and like
3:07
God gave us taste buds so that's not something to feel guilty about like that's it's a fine thing it's not like
3:16
this it's like this it's not a bad thing it's not an amazing thing it's just like a fine thing you know um but it's where
3:23
it becomes a drug sugar be sugar becomes a drug that it's a problem that God
3:28
doesn't want god doesn't want it to become this drug to you so moderation is fine now like caffeine coffee that will
3:36
have an effect too like a sugar can even sugar like sugar can give energy for some people so like a sugar high or
3:43
whatever they call you know so but that's not something to feel bad about that you have um like energy because
3:50
sugar gave you the energy for a little bit you don't need to feel like oh no I didn't get the the energy I'm feeling
3:56
right now from the Holy Spirit as long as you're not going to it constantly like I need this for this energy and so
4:05
for coffee and caffeine like you can have it because you enjoy it in
4:11
moderation um and even like to the fact that it caffeine has an effect of energy
4:17
of energizing you um that's not a bad thing it's not like something to feel like it's different like um alcohol is
4:24
something different alcohol and drugs is something different because it it like
4:30
dulls your senses and makes you and can like kind of change you not in a good
4:36
way to keep you from um to keep you from being able to hear from the Holy Spirit and be led by the Holy Spirit so even if
4:43
it's like a buzz you know it it is that drug is like
4:50
taking over and like changing you not necessarily in the good way um and
4:56
dulling your sensitivity to the sensitivity to the Holy Spirit whereas
5:01
like caffeine is not that way it's literally just bringing more energy it doesn't um uh like make you a different
5:10
person in a bad way just giving more energy um so to feel that effect of
5:16
energy that is not a bad thing that's a fine thing
5:21
um and to be like so like oh I feel energy after I had the coffee but oh is
5:27
that bad that's being religious you know um but it's all about moderation and so
5:35
if you know if you have the coffee and you feel the energy that's that's fine but if you're like going to it so much
5:43
and thinking like "Oh okay i need more i need more i need more." That's when it you're relying on it more than the Holy
5:49
Spirit's power and also like you're needing more because um you don't like
5:56
it takes more to like feel the effect type thing like that's a that's a sign that there is like this dependency
6:02
there's this um too much too much dependency on it you know so above all just in moderation
6:11
it is okay just everything in moderation so get to a place of moderation when you
6:17
are totally free of religion this is where you will shine the most because religiousness tries to dim your light
6:24
tries to keep you from walking in abundant light life um and tries to take
6:29
the joy away joy out of life away um and so it is for you to shine
6:36
brightly and and walk in your calling it is so important that you are fully free from
6:44
religion um and I mean that is honestly such a big key of why I have so much joy
6:50
in my life glory to God i have so much joy every day i have so much joy but
6:55
honestly one of the biggest reasons I have so much joy
7:00
is God has opened up my eyes of what walking in the new wine with the Holy
7:07
Spirit really is and opened up my eyes of religious lies and so now I'm able to
7:14
be free of those religious lies completely and completely walk in the the new wine and the Holy
7:19
Spirit hallelujah is religion and the angel of
7:25
light the same so um for the most part yeah so basically
7:31
the angel of light is referring to a scripture in the Bible where it says the devil masquerades himself as an angel of
7:37
light and the meaning of that is the devil will strategically come sounding
7:43
like God uh and so the main way that the
7:49
enemy sounds like God is through religion yes is through so well two ways
7:58
sounding like God through religion um and the other way
8:04
is like if someone is prideful like prideful about hearing
8:10
God's voice or maybe their eyes haven't opened up to hearing God's voice in the main ways that God speaks um and they're
8:19
just like listening to any thought that comes in their mind and so whenever they sounds whenever they hear something that
8:27
sounds like God whether it's God or like God the devil masquerade himself as an
8:34
angel of light they listen to it there's a lot of believers living this way a lot
8:40
of believers listen this way so so sometimes they're really following God but really hearing God's voice but other
8:46
times they're they're they're following the devil's voice when he comes masquerading himself as an angel of
8:52
light i have in-depth teachings on this i I know there's like three or four
8:57
messages I feel like in the past couple years where I taught very much in depth about
9:03
um like the devil coming with the voice of religion and the devil coming masquerade himself as an angel of light
9:08
but yeah back to the question is religion the angel of light so yeah the main way the devil comes is speaking is
9:16
that is religious doctrine is old wine doctrine um and that looks like
9:21
performance and perfectionism and rigidness and overboard like I was
9:27
talking about um on the live on Wednesday like so extreme like
9:33
um many times it's like God telling someone to do like like a really really
9:39
really long fast for example and um and just like sacrifice to such an
9:46
extreme but not really like with like doing things in an extreme way like without a purpose um
9:54
and like sometimes and here's another one like
10:00
sometimes like a person may may have such a passion to serve God like this is
10:05
where they find so much joy like but they don't they're they haven't found a
10:11
passion in working a job yet like different jobs they work they're not passionate about so
10:16
sometimes like a person will think I'm just supposed to quit my job and
10:22
um you know have like hardly any money or no money and spend my time like
10:29
serving God and like that for examp like this kind of like
10:34
extreme this kind of like extreme voice is many times the the voice of the the
10:41
the angel of light so it's like the enemy's tr the enemy knows that you will
10:47
you won't like do other sinful things that he would try to tempt you with so he doesn't even try he doesn't even try
10:54
so he instead tries to chip away at your abundant life trying to bring you in lack and many times that's financially
11:00
other times that can be just um chipping away at your I mean trying to distance
11:06
you from the love of God because like as I shared in my live this week I shared
11:12
with you how when God like when God has called me to sacrifice when God has called me to make sacrifice and
11:18
surrender um I've seen so much purpose in it not just in the purpose of refining me but
11:24
whenever there's a purpose in refining me it also directly correlates to his
11:29
kingdom um to advancing his kingdom for the good of his kingdom and um so it's like every
11:38
time I've seen God call me to make sacrifices
11:43
um I I've really been able in like pretty much real time oftent times I've
11:49
been able to see the reason why the purpose why how it greatly benefits the kingdom
11:55
that he's not just asking me to sacrifice something just for the heck of it or something like for no reason or
12:02
just like to test me type thing i'm not saying he never does that though i mean there are times he can test you just to
12:08
test you you know i'm not saying that but what I am saying is like if you're
12:14
if like a big way the devil comes is getting people to like sacrifice in
12:21
areas that God is not asking in a really extreme way that really the purpose is
12:27
the enemy wants you to not see God's love rightly um and make you like bitter
12:34
towards God and make you see God as being like mean
12:40
um and also to dim your light so that you're not walking in this revelation of
12:46
God's love and you're also not walking in abundant life in every area and so you're not shining as much people see
12:52
you and they don't want what you have right so um yeah yeah yeah yeah so like
13:00
whenever God has called me to sacrifice and surrender it's never affected my ability to shine from inside to outside
13:07
so like knowing that really helps you to discern the the voice of the angel of
13:13
light versus God's voice so anyways back to um the question yeah so most of the
13:20
time the devil masquering himself as the angel of light is like that Pharisee voice is speaking like how the Pharisees
13:27
would speak um and and so the other way it comes which
13:33
is still this religious way but many times it's like leading you into pride like God
13:40
told me this God told me this God told me this but actually God didn't it was
13:45
the angel of light um and so that's how you become
13:51
more susceptible to to be deceived by the angel of light is when you're
13:56
prideful in hearing God's voice god told me this god told me this god told me this
14:02
um that's that's usually the the the time and and and and I think you know
14:08
you know what I mean by that like God always speaks to us so it's not wrong to say the words "God told me this." But
14:14
every time I've seen someone use it like that so often and also in like ways
14:24
that aren't in align with God's principles and it's just kind
14:30
of like this person's like an anomaly god's telling them to do something completely different that's like outside
14:35
of his principles and really extreme um
14:41
that's it it's you you can tell like the um deceit of the angel of light there
14:47
when you're a frightful minister you say God told me you know um when it comes to
14:55
God speak but but but like when it the other times you should you could say God told me is
15:01
like when you're hearing the word of God through your spiritual leader where
15:07
you're planted [Music] um and so this word is coming forth and
15:14
you know God is really speaking to you but it's there's there's this assurance that indeed this is God's voice and so
15:21
when it comes to like sharing it with others that's an okay time to say God told me you have to be careful about
15:26
saying God told me to other people because if somebody said if you if one is to say God told me but it was
15:33
actually the angel of light then that can influence another person to think to receive that kind of
15:40
doctrine for themselves and and for like the angel of light to speak the same thing to that person and that person to
15:46
be like confident that this must be God's voice because this person to that
15:51
you know had said God told me to do this and so all of a sudden maybe the next day or next week or next month they start to hear that same voice and so
15:58
it's like well if God told them to do this that's that's confirmation you see what I'm saying that's why that's why I
16:03
say it's important to not like use it so like hastily um that
16:13
those words and so even if you say God told me like through hearing the word through your spiritual leader the more
16:19
wise way to say it would be like God spoke to me through my spiritual leader
16:25
through this teaching when she said this when she spoke this like God spoke to me
16:31
like you can confidently say it in that way because you you know there's you know there's safety there you know you
16:37
you know like because that's how God works god appoints the five-fold ministry to for that to for him to speak
16:45
through to equip others but other believers are growing and they haven't been necessarily equipped and anointed
16:52
and appointed to be the voice of God for other people they can encourage they can
16:59
um prophesy encouragement but not really thus says the Lord type things and so
17:05
even if you're saying it for your own personal life you have to really tread lightly tread carefully just just
17:10
knowing how you know there's a lot of people that are unsure about how to hear God's voice and so they can I I know
17:17
this happened to me in my life before um I came into this new wine and and my
17:23
eyes opened up i would hear other people say "God told me this god told me this god told me this." And they became teachers to me i looked up to them
17:29
because I wasn't confident in hearing God's voice i wasn't hearing the audible voice i wasn't having the audible voice
17:34
of God i wasn't having vivid visions vivid dreams or something and I wasn't so confident to say "God told me this
17:40
god told me this." And so this person saying "God told me this god told me this." So I automatically see them like
17:46
"Oh they can hear God's voice more than me." So like looking up to them as a teacher it's almost like that place of
17:51
like don't put yourself as a teacher you know you know like if you if you speak like as a teacher in a way you know not
18:00
even maybe you're not meaning to teach people but if you put yourself that way or how you're speaking even people can
18:08
um start to see you in that way and so that's why I'm saying it's important to just be careful about it um to not lead
18:16
others astray um yeah so so yeah like if
18:22
if if in other cases if you if Holy Spirit is leading you to do something and he's
18:27
made it very clear and you're confident in it like that will happen obviously obviously the Holy Spirit's speaking to
18:33
you through his word and confirming it through messages for example but um it's it's better to say I
18:42
believe the Holy Spirit is leading me to do this for example um just as other
18:48
people hear that so that they're not um seeing it as thus says the Lord type
18:55
thing also like you can also say God is saying this right now when it comes to like repeating the prophetic words
19:01
repeating the prophetic words that are released at the church where you're planted for example so like God is
19:07
saying that this is the year of acceptance like you can say that boldly but you should give context too you know
19:14
you shouldn't lead people to believe like God just revealed that to you you know you should share where you received
19:19
it from but you can say God is saying this now like you can you you should
19:24
boldly say that you know you're carrying the message this is part of spreading the gospel and I just share that just so
19:30
you you know don't go to don't don't go to the extreme like I'm saying like
19:36
religious like oh no I can't ever say God said this you know that's why I I
19:41
clarify that most times like you can share
19:46
podcast i mean you can share your testimonies all of you when you're not talking about the per when you don't say the person's name like if a person if
19:53
you talk about your testimony you know you experienced abuse from a person you don't like if you don't say the person's
20:00
name and at the same time you're speaking you know like gentle and with kindness and with love um you know
20:08
rather than like this person did this to me you know if you're speaking just like
20:14
just simply sharing like this was my past this is what happened and God freed me if you're sharing like that which
20:20
from what I see I think that's pretty much all I've seen from testimonies I've seen from you all um then it's okay
20:26
because you're not speaking in um you're not pointing any direction negative d
20:32
negative attention towards that person um you're just kind of sharing like this is what I went through and God freed me
20:40
so does that mean that people will hear it that way well the enemy wants to
20:46
plant lies many times you know trying to twist words but we can't be afraid of
20:52
that you know but it's really just with wisdom it's really just with wisdom um
20:58
based on like your relationship with them and based on like um if you've
21:04
talked with them about things like "Hey you know there was hurtful things that
21:10
happened in the past but I forgive you i love you." you know if you've like had conversations like that then the person
21:16
knows like you know this is in the past this is just part of your testimony now type thing and that's a way even showing
21:24
God's love and forgiveness and the kindness of God that leads to repentance is
21:30
is like how you share things not with with a grudge or condemning
21:39
i wonder if it's okay to direct a person to come to 5F who is a member of another church but they have oppression of
21:46
anxiety of driving is it okay to direct them to encounter God's power at 5F yes
21:52
that's what you're supposed to do yes oh my gosh yes yes yes yes this
21:57
is how we're the light of the world oh my gosh yes i mean um so many churches do not have God's
22:06
power um and we don't know where God wants
22:11
everybody planted and it's not our job to say you must be planted here you must
22:16
uproot yourself from where you are and plant yourself here that's not our job and we don't know where God's calling is
22:24
for people to be planted for what church it is for God's people to be planted i know all of a lot
22:31
of people a lot of people including myself have been planted at the wrong place or were planted at a seasonal
22:38
place well that's the case of a lot of people out there so how will those
22:43
people hear the good news and be directed to where God's calling them to be planted how through you testifying
22:51
being the light inviting them so you need to have that heart and understanding that there are a lot of pe
22:58
first of all every single child of God is supposed to be planted in a church where God's power is
23:06
moving where if they need freedom they can come and be set free because God's power is actually moving
23:14
there where they can be equipped and walk in their calling they can receive impartation of anointing they can
23:20
receive equipping that will reveal the schemes of the devil in their lives and they'll be able to have victory over the
23:26
devil so many churches do not have this equipping you need the anointing to have
23:32
this anointed teaching so there's so many believers out there that aren't experiencing the
23:37
power of God to deliver them but also aren't experiencing the power of God to teach them to open up their spiritual
23:42
eyes to equip them of the devil's scheme so that they can walk in victory over the devil this is a really sad reality
23:50
and we need to see the millions of believers with those eyes that this is really sad and 911 in serious because a
23:58
lot of those peoples don't they don't want to they they don't know any better they just haven't heard the good news yet they just haven't heard the the full
24:05
gospel yet they just don't know and so we need to really have this heart for
24:11
these people you were once those people i was once those people not living an abundant life in
24:18
bondage but now our eyes have seen we are called to be the light so people's
24:24
eyes can see hallelujah and so that's number one but number two um man the the anointing is
24:32
so rare and so I believe everybody should be invited to 5F Church or if there's
24:39
other churches where God's power is moving out there that people are a part of invite them to that church but like
24:44
if you found the power of God somewhere you got to invite everybody i mean you got to understand that like chances are
24:51
probably 99% chance that or more it could be 99.9 I don't know but there's
24:57
that much of a chance that the people you encounter the people that are planted at other churches the people
25:03
everywhere that you encounter are not planted where God has called them to be planted and are not experiencing the
25:09
power of God and are not walking in abundant life and are living in bondage you got to realize that that reality and
25:17
have a heart for those people so it's like we got to have a big time heart for like everybody in this world i mean
25:22
that's our calling as believers of course but like for our brothers and sisters like the church you're planted
25:28
like Five of Church like a lot of them are are they're walking an abundant life you
25:35
know that so but it's like we we as an army need to like look outward we need
25:40
to look outward for the people that are not walking abundant life we need to have a heart for all those people
25:45
outside who have not come in you know and so it's very important that we are
25:51
not just like enjoying abundant life with our brothers and sisters you know you know and and
25:57
feeling safe where we're understood and stuff you know and and we can't be the light among the light we have to go be
26:04
the light in the darkness you know you know like so so but that's what I'm saying like
26:10
like you know you can't just like look around and just be like "Okay these are just all the only people that God wants
26:17
here." Like no there's so many people that God wants to bring to 5F Church for
26:22
example or other churches where God's power is if you're watching from a
26:27
different church that has the God's power but there's so many people God wants to bring there to deliver them
26:34
there's so many people God wants to bring there for them to be planted there so and this is how the seeds are planted
26:40
like if a person's supposed to be planted at the different church that they currently are the way God brings
26:46
them there is by the seeds planted like God delivering them God touching them in power you know
26:53
hallelujah hallelujah so yeah just be just be the light and plant seeds you don't have to be like say like you need
27:00
to be planting where God's power is like you don't need to say that on day one
27:05
start with like oh they have anxiety you need to come to my church because God's power is moving there and delivers everybody come visit one Sunday like
27:13
start just planting a seed and then go from there you know like maybe they start you know being more and more open
27:20
being more and more open being more and more open and maybe they're coming to the place where it's like okay like like
27:25
you have a different kind of abundant life than I do or I'm not seeing everybody i I found deliverance from anxiety but I'm still not experiencing
27:31
abundant life this is the time you say are you following all God's principles you got to be planted the right place you got to be planted where God's power
27:37
is this is important you know that's the time you can drop that that word that seed you know in God's
27:44
timing what is the new wine revelation for intercession i believe I teach this i taught this more in depth on the
27:51
praying the Jesus way playlist i feel like it was maybe towards one of the
27:57
later messages I believe in that series yeah but
28:08
um how it looks like is taking the intention regularly to pray for your
28:16
leaders pray for the revival to spread and pray for people to come into the
28:22
kingdom and pray for um like when there's events and conferences when like
28:29
for example if I go to minister like in Toronto or London to be praying for the
28:35
field to be praying for the field to be praying for nothing to hinder people from coming because it's kind of like
28:41
your job as an intercessor is like to the my spiritual father shared this to
28:47
me he said sheep sheep produce more
28:52
sheep that's their job it's not the job of the shepherd to produce the sheep
28:57
it's the job of the shepherd to care for the sheep and minister to the sheep so we have this great this this the the
29:06
believers coming to into the church are called to go out and be the light in the world and bring people in birth bring
29:13
people to be birthed to be sheep to be fellow sheep to come into the church
29:19
they're the ones that are be supposed to be going out because like the shepherd their focus their anointing their
29:25
assignment like they're spending so much of their time and and focus and
29:30
concentration in feeding the sheep in ministering to the sheep
29:36
um in in in every door that God opens too like whether that's through media
29:41
and everything like it's all about feeding ministering releasing the power of God to the sheep that have
29:50
come not just to anybody to the sheep that have come so it's not the
29:56
shepherd's job to go out and get the sheep to come they can't they can't do it all
30:02
so where it's it's the believer's job like those who aren't the five-fold ministers or the shepherd of the church
30:09
it's a believer's big job to go out into the world to be the light in the darkness to shine brightly and to
30:15
attract people to Jesus invite them to church invite them to encounter God's
30:21
power invi like bring them to where they are called to be planted to where God's
30:28
will is for their life to bring them to their encounter to lead them to encounter their encounter and sometimes
30:34
they start to have encounters through you that lead them to the the bigger encounter that opens up their eyes to
30:41
where they're supposed to be planted and sets them in their path to be in God's will hallelujah so that's so important
30:49
you take that job so seriously to to birth more sheep um and so
30:58
like anyways so like the the the job of the minister is to cast out the demons
31:05
heal the sick like by and large i mean we all these signs shall follow us but like in terms of like the biggest call
31:12
like the work of the ministry at the church for example which is is is the most amount highest level anointing
31:19
taking place at events at the conferences and everything it's the minister's job to be releasing that
31:25
anointing to cast out the demons to heal the sick to preach the gospel to equip the people um so like their
31:33
prayers their prayers that's their prayer time i mean that's their that's their role of prayer i should say their
31:40
big role of prayer um and I as I taught in that series of
31:46
praying the Jesus way uh I taught about how I don't the minister does not need to pray Lord give me more anointing so
31:53
that I can like before you go to minister you don't you don't you don't have to pray may more anointing come on
31:59
me now so that I can be able to heal the sick and cast out demons lord heal the sick and cast out demons like you don't
32:05
need to pray that because God is already with you he's already anointed you he's already called you for this and so now
32:10
it's about walking in that kind of faith like thank you Lord for I know as I go and minister you will move you will
32:16
touch people you will heal people you will deliver me lord have your way i am your vessel i'm your servant have your
32:23
way lord thank you for moving in power today i know you were going to come and
32:29
move mightily like it's a prayer of faith rather than a place of
32:34
um God has to come and and like bring anointing and and begging for God to do
32:40
miracles you see that's different and so anyways for the minister that the
32:45
shepherd fal minister that's the role great role of prayer and so the believers have the pearl of intercession
32:51
in terms of preparing the field in terms of um like praying for hearts to be open
32:59
like they're they're they're supposed to be preparing that field to receive what
33:04
is going to be released um so I mean and this intercession looks like also just
33:10
like your heart for the people which is an action too like being the light in the world like making that action and
33:16
intention to be the light and to prepare the field to bring the field in and prepare the field but then also the
33:23
prayer part is praying that these people would receive that they would have open hearts to receive what God is going to
33:33
release and that's a big part of like this unity in the body this unity in the body that we're having this united heart
33:41
that we want God's kingdom to advance that we want more people to experience his power his love and step into revival
33:47
and so this intercession is is a big part of that is like renewing your mind to get your heart right to get your your
33:55
heart at the right place like not selffocused but that's a big part of prayer is that it's it's like we're
34:01
coming united in the spiritual realm with this way with this prayer this intercession
34:07
um for people to encounter God's power revival to spread in God
34:14
to have his way and be glorified side and also praying for your leaders just
34:20
just praying for them to have this heart um just just pray for them why does a
34:26
repeatedly open door through generations lead to a curse why are generational curses a thing instead of each
34:33
generation getting a fresh start to avoid that sin i I do believe I talk about that in depth like I explain that
34:41
in my book so I would read that again because
34:46
I'm going to be going a little more in depth in that than I will with this question with this answer but I'll answer it a little bit now but there's a
34:52
part I talk about generational curses and I really explain like why generational curses are a thing like why
34:59
this happens but um I mean above all above
35:05
all we're living in God's world so it's not like we don't have like why
35:15
did why when Adam and Eve um made that mistake
35:21
why why did God like allow the curse to
35:28
come upon all of us like why are we all blamed for that right i don't know like there's just
35:35
things that like there's things that don't really it's hard for our minds to
35:40
comprehend but we know God is good god is so good and he uses everything for
35:48
good and honestly like just right now as I share this like Adam and Eve they
35:54
didn't value God's presence they It's like they only knew beauty in heaven and
36:01
perfection and like now like if if if if maybe maybe God saw
36:08
that if he kept bringing a new Adam and Eve that the same exact pattern would
36:14
happen why did God allow the the devil to be on this earth um why didn't he
36:20
just like destroy him completely you know like these are mysteries you know
36:25
that it's not for us to like think about in a prideful way like
36:31
why would God do that not like that but it's just kind of there's these questions where it's not meant to like
36:39
for us to like fully figure out and and understand because we're not God and there's so many things that um there's
36:46
so many things that I mean you we we've experienced so many things in our lives i know you you
36:52
and me both have experienced so many things in our lives where we didn't get why God allowed something but then he
36:58
used it for good and then we saw that we we we end up thanking God for allowing
37:03
like a hard thing to happen that in the time we didn't understand and we it
37:10
didn't seem like God was good in that moment but then after we see that God is good and so that's like kind of how it
37:17
is with these things like maybe God saw that we would just
37:22
keep if he just created another Adam and Eve and just did like a restart a restart a restart that they would keep
37:29
choosing the devil's voice and not valuing what God had given them what they had with God and now that we see
37:36
like that we needed Jesus and we needed this sacrifice that he that he made for
37:41
us and we see like what our life was before Jesus and we see how much we need
37:47
him and we see we it like this creates so much value so so what God allowed
37:54
like in history what God allowed with Adam and Eve and the curse and the devil existing
38:00
um like the devil existing on this earth um all of this is causing us to see what
38:07
we have and value God and really love him instead of being like spoiled children robots spoiled children or
38:14
robots who don't have free will but just like live as like really entitled spoiled children um if you were born in
38:23
a bubble of like royalty and you never saw like poverty and you never saw how other people lived in this world you had
38:29
no clue would you really value the royalty life you're living in as much as
38:35
you would as if you at first at least saw how other people were living um
38:41
would you there's no way we could value it like that there's there's no way so this is getting kind of deep now
38:48
but that's the biggest answer I can give you in addition to what I wrote in my book i mean that's the biggest answer I
38:53
can give you is that there's things that it's not meant
38:59
for us to like have logic about to like fully comprehend in this moment but just to know that so there's things in
39:04
spiritual realm like okay generational curses happen because it's simply this when you open up a door to the enemy
39:12
you're you're choosing to give him access and you even the seeds the seeds
39:18
in your you are a man you carry seeds you're a woman you carry eggs like that's you you have to choose to take
39:25
care of your body you have to choose to take care like those eggs aren't separate from
39:31
your body those seeds in the man are not separate from his body and and if if if the bo if the man or
39:38
woman abuses their body guess what that affects the eggs that affects the seeds
39:43
does that make God um not care about or absent uh you know in that future
39:50
child's life this is we're connected to our family like it's we're connected and
39:56
the Bible talks about this importance that like we have dominion on this earth we have dominion to either make the
40:03
world a beautiful place and bring light to this world or not we have dominion to to raise up our children to serve the
40:10
Lord we have do we have that dominion like we have power over our children we
40:15
have power over how our children if our children will be blessed or cursed god has given us that dominion and authority
40:22
so like when a when a person has a baby this baby isn't like isolated from the
40:28
parent all right and then but then like once a child is of age to um to seek God
40:34
on their own now they become this this like separate entity where they can be
40:40
separate from their parent and but like a child you know you can't just be like
40:46
a 2-year-old and just on your own in the world you're connected to your your parents at that point that's just how it
40:53
is and those parents have dominion over you have authority over you and so so
41:00
that's that's what it's about like so people opening up doors they're giving the enemy access to their own personal
41:06
life but they're also giving the enemy access to their their eggs their seeds and God redeems everything god saves God
41:13
breaks the curse but you got to go about it God's ways you got to seek God for that and you got to do things God's principles it doesn't just automatically
41:20
happen so um it's that kind of complexity thing that I'm talking you
41:25
see what I'm saying it's something deep but it's true it's like understanding the world we live in the spiritual realm
41:31
the kingdom of God and how why did God create us to have dominion and authority
41:36
i don't know if he didn't do that then this wouldn't be a thing what I'm talking about but God is so good and he
41:43
saw that he was going to give us dominion and authority and it's his purposes are beautiful but he could have
41:48
just created us a different way and just we're just robots without free will
41:54
but you you see what I'm saying and so um that's how it is that that's why
42:02
generational curses happen is because we're we're connected the person before
42:07
you use that the per your your your parent or your grandparent use your
42:12
authority their authority the wrong way this is this is and this is getting deep but this is like why we need revival so
42:18
much this is why it's 911 emergency oh because like there's so there's so many
42:24
children and there's so many adult children who have generational curses that God is ready to free them is
42:32
deliver them break these curses but they got to know the truth they got to come into God's power and he'll break the
42:37
curses immediately so it's like you can understand God's goodness more when you
42:42
see how God intended the church to be and how the church dropped the ball the church missed some things the church
42:47
diverted away by and large and that caused people to stay in bondage and to
42:52
stay in generational curses but if if the Axe church just stayed how it was it just kept going how it was like from
42:59
generation to generation it was the Axe church everything was done right god's power was always there then the world
43:04
would look a lot different there would be a lot less generational curses there wouldn't be all these c all Christians wouldn't even have generational curses
43:11
or or or or or you know children that could or young adults that came to Jesus
43:17
would immediately get get delivered from a generational curse that they had from a parent that was in the world or something um because they would come to
43:24
church and the church would carry the power of God that's how it's supposed to be god is so good but h humanity has diverted
43:31
away from God it's like by and large the humanity of the church and it's like what we read in the in the in the like
43:37
the Old Testament we see like people in their own free will decide to go away from God and it affects all of the
43:45
people not just the people that diverted away so it's
43:51
like and then it that's how it is you know it it we're connected you know and
43:57
and we carry this responsibility having dominion we got to use our dominion rightly and if people have used it wrong
44:02
in the past that's not God's fault um if we can seek him he can take away
44:07
everything all of the hurt all of the abuse all the generational curses all the junk all the religion that came from
44:13
the past generations that chose to go away from God he can take that away in a second if you'll just see God
44:19
fully amen hallelujah but um it's a
44:24
complex thing it's a complex thing it's a deep thing but God doesn't call us to
44:31
um be adult-minded in it but be childlike mind like childlike like simply know God is good god is faithful
44:38
god created the universe god created all his principles god created the spiritual realm god allowed this to the devil to
44:45
exist that's just how it is god allowed it um
44:52
and this is the world we're living in that God created and this is how we get
44:58
free this is how we break generational curses exist this is how we get free from generational
45:03
curses okay you know like just as ch as children you know we just accept things
45:09
how they are how God created them whether rather than like trying to like figure it all out and understand God's
45:15
goodness but like just trust that he is good you know and um and then just do
45:21
what he says to do just oh we have generational people have generational curses we got to break them by God's
45:27
power you know oh I have a generational curse i need to seek God to be free of the generational curse like he just
45:32
calls us to be children to be like children to be a childlike and just trust him and obey
45:39
him amen my son shared about Jesus at school um his classmate is hungry to
45:46
learn but the classmates's parents told him not to hang out with my son how
45:52
should he handle this this is spiritual warfare this is spiritual war the devil's angry this just shows how
45:58
powerfully God is using your son and how anointed he is and how angry the devil
46:05
is but Jesus has the victory no matter what and so um I mean it just depends on
46:11
the complexities of the situation but um you can just share for your son
46:19
to show love to this person and like if the classmate is open to talking to your
46:25
son still or if the if he's like shut off because of what the parent said to him then just just just share with your
46:34
son to show love the best he can but not be like pushy you know go with his free
46:40
will um I mean go go go according to the
46:45
classmates's free will so like it depends like if the parents are telling
46:51
the kid don't hang out with him anymore and um the kid listens to the parents
46:57
and is like I'm not hanging out like really listening then we can't force
47:02
anything you know so you know just encourage your son that this is the spiritual warfare that he learns about
47:08
but we have victory this shows just how powerfully God is using him and to also be confident that God has indeed planted
47:14
seeds because the children can the pure in heart see the truth and children
47:21
really can see the truth they really can see i remember like the boy I nannied like he he was in
47:29
um his his mother was Jewish and not open to Jesus at all and he became a
47:35
believer as I testified about miracles of Jesus and shared Jesus with him and one time I prayed for him and he
47:41
experienced a miracle as I prayed for him and that he his eyes were buggy like like that was Jesus and he became a
47:48
believer and like one time I remember bringing him and his friend and he was like they were 12 at the time at at the
47:54
time I think or maybe 11 11 or 12 and I'm bringing them to eat somewhere and
47:59
they're like so I I wish I remember the conversation cuz this is just memories just coming back to me and it was so
48:05
precious and filled me with so much joy but these two boys were like so hungry about God and we're talking about God
48:11
and I was like a kid in a candy store i was just so excited because it had just been especially because it had just been
48:18
like that year I think that I was set on fire for Jesus completely so I was just listening to them talk and I was talking
48:25
with them about God and I was just so in awe cuz they're 12 years old like they're so young and I I had never seen
48:30
like young children like this like hungry for God in this way but um but
48:36
yeah his it was amazing this 12-year-old had a wisdom like he knew his mom wasn't opened and so he didn't really talk much
48:42
about it and sometimes there's wisdom that sometimes it's important for the child to plant seeds to their parents but sometimes it's it's wisdom to just
48:50
um to just know when it's not time to force anything you know and so I really
48:55
saw that that boy like had a wisdom and so he just but but what I'm trying to say is like he totally believed in Jesus
49:02
but he knew his mom didn't so just because so like what I'm trying to say is a child can like when it comes to God
49:09
they can see the truth and even if their parents say something different like the children can see the truth or even if
49:16
maybe they're confused for a moment those seeds are planted and God will continue to pursue them and reveal that
49:22
it's true what what this person has heard about God um so yeah just like encourage your son
49:30
about that and just encourage him that he planted serious seeds and God is working upon those seeds mightily um so
49:36
if the child is like cold towards your son now just say it's okay you planted
49:42
seeds keep showing love keep smiling at him just you know don't act like anything's awkward or show hatred or
49:48
anything like just just smile at him if that's all he'll do or will look at you or something but if the child is still
49:55
like friendly with your son then you can you know share that he can just keep
50:00
being himself and keep shining his light and share about God when the time as
50:06
Holy Spirit leads you know and um because we don't need to cower down
50:12
to the enemy ever even children talking about Jesus shouldn't counter down to
50:18
the enemy moving through adults you know
50:24
because God is greater god in him is greater even though he's small like
50:29
David you know he's like David he's like David and there will be Goliaths he faces and this is a kind of
50:35
a Goliath but greater is he who is in him than he who is in the world um out
50:41
of the mouths of infants out of the mouths of babes out of the mouths of children will come praises to God the
50:47
Bible says so and the Pharisees there's a scripture when that when that scripture comes forth it's actually in
50:52
the time of when there's intense persecution towards Jesus before he was crucified and and the Pharisees were
50:57
like just complaining complaining speaking all these false accusations
51:02
attacking persecuting and basically Jesus is like the praise can't be
51:08
stopped like the children will keep praising even like you can't even stop the praise through children you can't
51:14
stop God moving through children you can't stop praises coming from children you you can't stop God's movement on
51:20
this earth from adults to even children um the rocks cry out if people are quiet if adults are quiet God will use
51:28
children so encourage re replay what I've just um shared if he's not watching
51:34
right now but you can share this with him later um and just just share with him he's like a David how God is using
51:41
him so powerfully at a young age and he's so proud of him and to not back down but to keep shining bright don't
51:46
let anything intimidate him or bring him fear god will always fight for him and stand with him amen i think children are
51:53
much wiser than we think because they see things very clear without overcomplicating things exactly exactly
51:59
that's why God says you must become like a child to enter in the kingdom of heaven because the more we overco complicate things the more we hinder our
52:06
eyes from seeing spiritually the more we are we just simply believe we simply believe and we simply trust God and we
52:13
have that purity in our heart and humility the more we can see God and so
52:21
if children can hear the gospel if they can be exposed to God's power they will come quickly usually
52:29
they I mean they will see quickly what to do when the enemy attacks through pe different people but
52:36
in a similar way sometimes this can be a jealousy thing like sometimes people are
52:42
jealous of the same thing the the Jesus they see in you the light they see in you and the enemy influences them with
52:49
jealousy um because when people act on jealousy it's an act of hatred and it's
52:57
an act of um trying to stop the light in somebody trying to stop how someone's
53:03
shining many times it's to try to steal try to stop and then like
53:10
copy or like they think in their minds that if you're not shining as bright
53:15
then they'll shine brighter um which is a lie
53:22
so when you really have the light of Jesus in you and you've been transformed most
53:27
likely I shouldn't say most likely you always find jealousy there will you will always come across jealousy
53:33
and so [Music] um many times that you'll find that
53:40
again and again that same kind of attack and so you have to be aware of like what
53:45
the enemy's aim is like you have to it's important to recognize these attacks through people and see that it's similar
53:52
like if it's jealousy for example you see what's going on in the spiritual realm you see what the enem is after the
53:58
enemy wants your light to dim the enemy wants you to retreat the enemy wants you
54:04
to feel bad feel down feel afraid um and just not shine as bright that's
54:10
what the enemy is after and so he influences people and they feel these things too they feel these things that
54:16
the enemy feels they allow the enemy to influence them and then they they act
54:21
out on that all right so really it's mostly just about that awareness to know
54:27
what's going on in the spiritual realm um and then to just reject it to say "No I will not hinder my light i will not um
54:36
I will not allow the enemy to hinder my light i will not retreat i will not dim my light i will not stop arising but I
54:43
will keep on arising and shining." As simple as that you know just reject the
54:49
lie any lies the enemy is bringing through those attacks and confess the truth declare the truth um and bless and
54:57
pray for those for the enemies um if it's a similar attack but
55:03
it's not having to do with jealousy just notice that this attack it's like just the enemy's trying to
55:10
um maybe and it could be a weakness maybe people are attacking something that's like a weakness
55:15
and the enemy is using this to because every weakness we have God wants to make it a strength for him right but we start
55:23
out as it weak but then when we obey God he puts his power on it and then it becomes our strength like preaching
55:30
ministering being an apostle public speaking and being a leader to me those
55:36
were all extreme weaknesses like the most weaknesses to me like those are
55:42
qualities that were weaknesses for me those were skills and gifts that I didn't even have i felt I mean I could
55:50
speak i could act and sing i could speak yes i knew that like I did well in
55:57
English class that was like my my best subject so like I knew I
56:03
could I had the like intelligence or whatever to like communicate and
56:10
everything there was that but like when it comes to speaking off the cuff public speaking
56:16
in front of a group of people and specifically preaching I feel like I didn't have an ability of that like at all pretty
56:23
much but that became my strength and God wanted that to be my strength but it was
56:28
a true weakness on my own but then God's power came upon it and then it made it a strength so now these are my strengths
56:36
but only because of God it's supernatural that it's a strength
56:42
so [Music] um whatever weakness you have like God
56:47
wants to put his supernatural power in it and it to become a strength whether that's like the main thing that you're
56:53
doing like how this is the main thing I'm doing or not or it's just something he wants to reveal his power in and be
57:00
glorified through um all of your weaknesses God wants to
57:06
put his power on and make it not a weakness anymore but a strength supernaturally so
57:14
um so like understand that God will get so much glory and many times your exact
57:22
purpose is related so much to your weakness like God wants to use your weakness like the most powerfully many
57:28
times many times that's what he wants to like use the most powerfully is your weakness like he makes it a strength he
57:35
makes it like the biggest strength like you know it's it's wild like years ago I considered singing my biggest strength
57:43
um and I considered like preaching and ministering and being a leader my biggest weakness but now it's like
57:49
flip-flopped you know so and God gets so much glory in that
57:55
so um sometimes the enemy will use people
58:00
to attack your weakness that God wants to be a strength so that it never comes
58:07
to the place of it being a strength so like imagine if
58:13
I you know listen to the devil's lies and listen to people's lies the people's
58:18
attacks you know speaking against my weakness and I just like gave up or I never allowed God to turn it into a
58:24
strength through obedience through continuing to arise arise and shine imagine you know I wouldn't be living my
58:31
calling living out my calling and God couldn't use me at the in the extent
58:36
that he wanted to use me by any means so that's the scheme that the devil has
58:42
for people to I mean towards people's weaknesses he's afraid of people's
58:48
weaknesses turning into strengths that glorify God and that the weakness becomes actually
58:54
like the bigger than the biggest strength that the person has like he he's afraid of that and so many times
59:01
but many times we'll like believe the enemy's lies because it is a weakness at the moment and are like so we we become
59:07
like more insecure about it that's what the devil wants so that's what you have to be aware of to just know what's going
59:13
on in the spiritual realm and reject his lies and confess the truth and keeping keep on obeying God keeping keep on
59:18
arising and shining keep on allowing God to use your weaknesses to move through
59:23
your weaknesses how do you navigate seemingly religious scripture like women should cover their head
59:31
um so there's a lot of things that were I mean you see that's a New Testament
59:37
scripture but it's obviously religious and does not apply to us today it's because it was speaking
59:43
in context to the culture it was it was not supposed to be spoken as a doctrine
59:50
for everyone and for all of us just like scriptures that say women shouldn't preach woman should shouldn't be in a
59:56
place of authority this was speaking according to the culture and the context of the situation like when it came to
1:00:03
the women at that time in the culture of that time women were being rebellious women were being um they were being
1:00:10
influenced by other cultures of goddesses and gods like they were being like the culture
1:00:16
there was was influenced so much by this false these false religions
1:00:24
and that influence was heavy in that time and it's like the women
1:00:32
were being influenced by the enemy by and large at that time to be loud in the church to
1:00:40
um be even like prideful and wanting spiritual
1:00:45
gifts and speaking and everything it's what was happening at that time was
1:00:50
influencing the women so much by and large that at that time it was not it
1:00:55
was not the time prophetically for women to be teaching so much of having to do with the culture in general
1:01:03
um at that time and um it was not time for them to be to be
1:01:10
like leading in that and that was in that specific city by the way too it wasn't everywhere it was that specific
1:01:16
city because you see other scriptures in the New Testament you see women leading you see a woman and man a husband and
1:01:23
wife being entrusted to teach being given letters from Paul to teach to
1:01:30
others and they're even like together correcting and teaching someone um we
1:01:35
see examples of this it wasn't just the man it was the woman doing this too
1:01:40
uh we see a woman another woman who was sent by Paul to bring his letters to teach his letters to share his teachings
1:01:47
with the church so she was entrusted to a place of leadership a place of um
1:01:52
teaching and Jesus chose to reveal himself for the very first time to a woman and to Mary and he said go share
1:02:01
what you have seen and so she was like literally the first person to speak that's the message of the gospel to share that he is risen he ch that wasn't
1:02:08
an accident that wasn't like a whoops I should have revealed myself to a man first that was not an accident you know
1:02:15
God chose it to be that way so that affirms that women can be entrusted that God wants to use me women in a place of
1:02:22
leadership in a place of teaching you know her preaching the gospel that was teaching that was preaching you know
1:02:29
that wasn't just like sharing an encouraging word um we see there's prophetesses in the New Testament as
1:02:35
well uh and in the Old Testament we also see judges are pl there were women who were
1:02:42
judges and that is a place of leadership and God anointed them for that and called them they weren't just there
1:02:49
randomly um so that we know all of this we know that's why we know these scriptures to say women cannot uh teach
1:02:57
women cannot be in a place of leadership or authority over men we know that these are having to do with the culture with
1:03:04
the context at that specific city at that specific time um and so it's the
1:03:10
same thing with the head coverings that was having to do with it's you have to look at the context it was having to do
1:03:15
with the culture of that specific time so um there are scriptures like that
1:03:20
that you need to have that wisdom you need to know the context you need to know the culture and know that that does
1:03:27
not apply to you it was not supposed to be this doctrine for the whole body of Christ and for the whole body of Christ
1:03:32
for the whole body of Christ that then and also the whole body of Christ for all time but these are not some some things that we should be like we don't
1:03:38
need to be like hyperfocused on we can already know there's certain things you you read that scripture in the Bible you just you can know based on knowing who
1:03:45
God is based on looking at your leader you can know that that was that is not
1:03:53
for you today that is not for us today that was for the people in the context of their culture at that time in that
1:03:59
moment um so you you can just already know that
1:04:06
you don't it's not like you have to feel like you have to go on this I don't understand the scripture so I
1:04:12
have to There's certain scriptures like this where you can know you can you can
1:04:17
have that understanding from the Holy Spirit um and and looking at your leader and
1:04:25
and you know under having that understanding and the reason why I say that is that sometimes people get so hung up on like random scriptures that
1:04:31
God is just like not wanting you to pay so much attention to at this moment in
1:04:36
time God wants you to instead be focusing on like what is being released through your leader for example um and
1:04:43
it's just can be it can be the angel of light it can be that voice of religion you know um like Jesus brought this new
1:04:50
wine and the Pharisees were bringing around these other scriptures like you should not heal people on the Sabbath um
1:04:58
you know bringing around these other scriptures that God was not focusing on right right then you know that was
1:05:05
distracting and taking away from what God was trying to do in that moment
1:05:10
um so it's like sometimes that's that angel of light voice of voice of religion devil masquer devil
1:05:17
masquerading himself as an angel of light and being like look at the scripture what about the script you know you see what I'm saying so that's why
1:05:24
when it comes to the word we need to have that new wine perspective void of
1:05:29
religion so to we so we can really hear the holy spirit speaking to us through the word and not get distracted with other things in the word that the enemy
1:05:37
could be the angel of light could be drawing drawing your attention to what does count the cost
1:05:43
mean i have talked about that a few times in some messages i'm trying to think one to
1:05:50
point to you just for because some of these questions that's why I direct you to messages because some of these I don't want to answer in just like two
1:05:56
sentences i want to I want you to get the full teaching um I know I taught a lot about it like
1:06:03
almost exactly a year ago i think it was like one of the first weeks after
1:06:09
the conference and I think it might have been called count the cost actually but
1:06:16
um in general counting the cost means when God speaks of this he's speaking
1:06:21
this when Jesus speaks this he's speaking this in the context of picking up your cross that if you don't pick up
1:06:26
your cross you cannot and if you don't pick up your cross you cannot be his real disciple so what he's saying with
1:06:32
that is is you have to surrender everything and everything everything
1:06:37
everything every part of your life like you have to put it in God's hands you have to give it to him and this includes your plans your dreams and your will
1:06:44
this includes old wine uh pride ego these are these are the
1:06:50
things that I just named that many people hold on to they surrender other things they surrender their life in the
1:06:56
world doing worldly activities and they instead read the Bible go to church pray worship but they
1:07:04
hang on to these other things they hang on to old wine they hang on to pride they hang on to ego reputation um caring
1:07:10
what people think about you they hang on to their plans their dreams their free will their selfish
1:07:15
ambitions so you got to surrender everything and so um that's when he talks about counting the cost is about
1:07:21
like you're not considered my disciple if you won't pick up your cross and so then he talks about like picking up the
1:07:27
cross that's surrendering everything so you got to realize what it means to be my disciple you got to like you got to
1:07:35
count the cost and see the cost of following me like you got to be ready for this um you know because like things
1:07:42
can come up and then God asks for more we got to be ready to just give more instead of be like I don't want to do
1:07:48
this this is too hard that's not counting the cost like count the cost
1:07:54
like when you surrender to God or when God's convicting you more into deeper surrender count the cost like realize
1:08:00
that he's really asking for everything realize what picking up your cross really means look at the li areas in
1:08:07
your life that you haven't given up yet count the cost like oh I haven't paid
1:08:13
this yet i haven't given this yet to God surrendered this yet to God i need to I
1:08:19
need to count these things in my life that I haven't given to God yet and I need to give it to him and then you also
1:08:24
need to count in the future like things like your ego and reputation and like like having a good ego good
1:08:31
reputation you know like like for me for example like I have a really good
1:08:37
reputation glory to God by a lot of people by like you for example you see me with God's eyes you see me in a good
1:08:44
light praise God you see me as a servant of God like doing good in the world and helping people helping you so you see me
1:08:52
so I have a good reputation with you um but there's a lot of people in
1:08:57
the world I don't have a good reputation where or I mean they don't they don't
1:09:02
see me in a good light they think the opposite they think a lot of people in this world they think wrongly about me
1:09:08
they believe lies of the enemy about me they think I'm from the devil they think I'm deceived they think I'm leading
1:09:14
people astray they think I'm leading a cult they think you know they think all these things they think all these crazy
1:09:22
things horrible things and like they really think these things these people some some of these people really believe these things and so they are literally
1:09:29
seeing me with hate they're seeing me as this horrible person and people have
1:09:34
free will and I can't change their minds and so I know like I I don't spend time a lot of time thinking about it but I
1:09:41
know that I have a really bad reputation with a lot of people by a lot of people
1:09:47
a lot of people like see me as this like evil person wrongly they're seeing that but
1:09:53
that's their reality like they're living in that reality they're living that in that reality fake reality
1:10:01
um and uh that's what it means about giving up your reputation your ego like you choose to not let that bother you
1:10:08
because that's like that's not an easy thing that's not an easy thing um to do
1:10:13
you know to have that not to I mean uncountable amount of people think that way of me not just like one do a handful
1:10:20
a lot of people think that way about me but there are more with me than those against me hallelujah and it only cares
1:10:26
about what God I only care what God thinks about me so it doesn't matter but um but yeah like you got to count that
1:10:33
cost so like when God called me to this when God called me to to to surrender everything to him I had to count that
1:10:39
cost and I would even look at my spiritual father and look at what he's gone through and look at his persecution and I would be like "Oh that's common
1:10:46
for me." Like "Oh I count the cost." Like God made the cost clear like it cost this much you know
1:10:52
it's going to cost this it's going to cost this it's going to cost your reputation and so before it came time to pay that you know to give up that I
1:11:02
realized it includes this it includes this my spiritual father went through this people think horrible things about
1:11:09
him there's going to come a time that's going to happen to me okay I accept that
1:11:14
i accept that i'll I'll be content with that like I I won't I I'll be okay with
1:11:19
that i'll I'll that I I count the cost i'll pick up my cross Lord so you know a
1:11:26
lot of my life of surrender has been preparation beforehand has been counting the cost and that's how you don't
1:11:31
stumble that's how you are able to stay in God's will that's how you're able to like keep your contentment because
1:11:38
you've already counted the cost it's like um it's like when you go to buy a car or you go to buy something expensive
1:11:44
maybe it's a house or something or you're getting a new apartment and then it's going to be more rent than you had
1:11:50
before but like you know the cost you go to the place to buy the car you know the cost and so you don't go there like um
1:11:58
grim you don't go there like this stinks this is horrible i can't believe I have
1:12:03
to do this like it could be the most amount of money you've ever spent and maybe it's going to be difficult
1:12:08
financially because of that right but if it's a new car for example you know or
1:12:13
something you really desire I'm speaking like in a godly way of course not in a um worldly way of course but you know
1:12:20
you're you're okay you're like "Okay here's the money no big
1:12:26
deal." So that's how it is in the spiritual realm like I counted the cost and it helped me
1:12:33
be able to seamlessly
1:12:38
transition to the refining fire times and not stumble and not be like God
1:12:45
where what are you doing how can you allow this God told me the cost from the beginning so I was
1:12:52
prepared you know it's like that it's like that we should count the cost so that we don't stumble so we don't see
1:12:58
God in the wrong light We're not complaining um we're keeping able to shine our light and when God said the
1:13:04
day comes oh it's due like more cost okay here you go we can just keep going
1:13:12
in God's will day by day by day by day not stumbling not delaying not falling um and continuing to shine our light
1:13:18
through it continuing to keep our peace and joy through it are there any super in-depth
1:13:24
teachings on how to surrender i know I have messages with the title of surrender in it and I speak on surrender
1:13:30
quite often actually um but mostly it's like your eyes your
1:13:36
spiritual eyes opening up to the importance of surrender and how Jesus is worthy of it which I talk about a lot
1:13:44
actually in session one of Arise and Shine conference which was streamed so you can find my YouTube session one but
1:13:50
that's the biggest key to surrender is mostly just as you seek God and you find more of him your eyes open up more to
1:13:56
how worthy he is to surrender and then it just happens like you're like you desire you you need to get to a place of
1:14:02
desiring to surrender everything and to get to that place you got to seek God more and find more of
1:14:08
him and when your eyes open up more to his goodness to his love to his almightiness to his
1:14:15
majesty everything within you just you love him so much you fall in love everything within you have the fear of
1:14:21
God the reverence everything within you just wants to give everything to him it's the only thing that feels right
1:14:26
that's my testimony like it only and someone asked me it's the only thing that feels right it's just like it just
1:14:33
feels right it just feels completely wrong to not start everything it feels selfish it feels prideful it feels gross it feels disgusting it feels out of
1:14:39
God's will it feels rebellious it feels um stupid it feels foolish like when
1:14:45
your when your eyes open up it's just like this just makes sense this is all I want and I'm in love with Jesus and have
1:14:52
it all like you're Lord lead me i don't know where I'm going you do Lee you know
1:14:58
the plan for my life hallelujah someone asked me on the
1:15:03
revival tour history tour that we did um that I did last week which I will be posting like an edited version in the
1:15:10
future but you can see on the live stream for now it was so amazing so powerful but someone asked me "Do you
1:15:15
ever feel like giving up?" And I was like "No but it's because my spiritual eyes opened up like there's there's no way I can be out
1:15:22
of God's will there's no way I can displease God if I can help it
1:15:29
like no it's it it does it doesn't make sense i can't it does it It can't I have
1:15:35
to be in God's will it's just this like I love God i have to be in his will i I'm a servant of him like Mary she said
1:15:42
um "Let it be done to me as you said for I'm a servant of the Lord." That's like how I feel in my heart whatever God says
1:15:48
I have to do we We're children we're servants that's who we are we just have to obey him and this is this is the best
1:15:55
thing and this is the most beautiful thing and this is what brings abundant life and peace and joy and this is how we fulfill our purpose and this is how
1:16:02
we get to bless others and this is how we touch God's heart it's everything's there there's no benefit outside of
1:16:08
God's will there's none so of course hallelujah
