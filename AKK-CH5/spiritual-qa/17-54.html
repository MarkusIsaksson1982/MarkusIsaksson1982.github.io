 how does free will come into play with generational curses family member
 is not
 0:05
 speaking to us we believe the curse has been broken but can the family 
member's
 0:11
 free will prevent seeing breakthrough yes so with this situation
 0:18
 it really just depends it really just depends because maybe a generational
 0:23
 curse is the biggest thing biggest
 0:30
 um reason why a person is really opening up doors to the enemy and going
 into the
 0:36
 world's way and so if that's the case and you know you come and renounce
 and
 0:42
 receive freedom from the generational curse then the power of God can 
touch
 0:48
 that person's life as there has been something that has happened in the 
family this curse has been broken um and
 0:56
 and and it can release this Grace release this
 1:02
 this all of a sudden maybe the person may be more open to God that can 
happen
 1:08
 but at the end of the day it's so much about free will so if there's a 
generational curse but also a person has
 1:16
 doors open to the devil and wants to keep those doors open to the devil is
 1:22
 not really Desiring to seek God then the person will still see oppression 
usually
 1:29
 because Free Will is the the one of the biggest parts of of
1:35
 receiving Jesus and all that he offers it's based on Free Will and there's this
 law this principle
 1:43
 when you open up doors to the enemy you're giving him permission to 
bring
 1:50
 oppression to have authority over your life so [Music]
 1:57
 um it it it just depends on the situation like how much that person you 
know is wanting to do the
 2:06
 things of the world and open up doors to the enemy in that case if the 
generational curse is broken perhaps you
 2:12
 may not see a tremendous change in the person but we always have hope 
for
 2:19
 people everyone and we pray and we believe that our seeds are being 
planted
 2:24
 and that it's making a difference that that what we are doing showing love 
to
 2:30
 the person and being the Light of Christ is PL truly planting seeds and we 
will
 2:35
 see a harvest yeah so but just to summarize that if a person really is not
 2:41
 in the place of wanting to seek God and the generational curse is broken 
you may
 2:47
 not see a tremendous change like if if you came to to to break the 
generational
 2:53
 I mean to receive freedom from the generational curse it doesn't 
necessarily mean that automatically
 2:59
 everyone in the family is just completely different all of a sudden
3:04
 wanting to serve God doesn't necessarily mean that but but it could be like 
um
 3:10
 especially if it's parents who are coming parents of children like if you
 3:16
 and they renounce and they um receive freedom from this generational 
curse
 3:23
 there will probably be a huge difference in the children's lives um because
 3:30
 that generational curse was upon them from birth you know and so now 
that this
 3:38
 is broken I mean that in that case that is a big reason why there has been 
all
 3:44
 these other kinds of Oppression in the person's life in the child's life so for 
parents you it'll you'll probably really
 3:51
 see such a difference um in the child's life and maybe a desire more of a 
desire for
 3:58
 Jesus to seek him um but if you're talking about like
 4:04
 other family members like um like that aren't your children but other 
members
 4:11
 of the family it's going to be depending so much on their Free Will how do 
you
 4:17
 know what parts of your testimony to share is there ever a time when 
someone is not supposed to share their
 4:22
 testimony yet um yes so first of all the parts of your
 4:28
 testimony to share so when you've experienced change in your life when 
you've really experienced
 4:35
Deliverance healing when you really saw it manifest in your life that you 
should
 4:44
 share um you know because there's sometimes that deliverance and healing
 is a process so you've received it in
 4:50
 the spiritual realm like maybe through the word declared um at church or 
in this live
 4:56
 stream for example you believe with all of your heart it is happen but you 
have not seen it manifest yet
 5:02
 sometimes it doesn't manifest until a day later a week later a month later 
longer sometimes but it's already
 5:09
 happened in the spiritual realm well it's it's best to not testify until
 5:16
 it's truly manifested um when you can truly see I
 5:23
 have been delivered I no longer have um Suicidal Thoughts I no longer 
feel
 5:29
 anxiety you know um but but but like also once you have experienced that
 5:36
 you've experienced let's say you've experienced um freedom from suicidal
 5:42
 thoughts let's say and they just disappeared but then maybe a week later
 5:48
 a month later months later there's an attack of the enemy bringing these 
Suicidal Thoughts but this
 5:55
 time it's an outward attack like it's not demons from within like
 6:00
 before this happens many times when a person's delivered that God will 
allow
 6:05
 the enemy to attack and God uses as a testing um and at this point you are
 6:13
 supposed to walk in your Authority and submit to God resist the devil and 
he has to flee you reject him and he has to
 6:19
 flee where before when you had demons you would reject all day maybe 
and
 6:25
 nothing would happen because it's the anointing that destroys the Yoke not 
you personally rejecting it's the anointing
 6:32
 that destroys the O Yol you need the power of God moving through a 
vessel higher level of anointing the what you
 6:38
 carry to to execute that authority over your life okay but for for a lot of
 6:45
 people maybe most people they will find an attack on their Deliverance or
 6:51
 healing um where maybe even it feels similarly to when they were 
oppressed but the difference is they're you're
 6:57
 supposed to walk in your Authority resist the devil reject the devil's lies 
and he has to flee now maybe the fleeing
 7:03
 won't happen immediately maybe it'll be a week or a month of like the 
devil
 7:10
 really trying to bombard you with these thoughts again perhaps but it's not 
a demon it's just a demon inside it's just
 7:17
 an attack like we all go through we all go through these spiritual attacks 
these times where the Devil comes with this
 7:24
 strategy like when Jesus went when the Holy Spirit Led Jesus Into the 
Wilderness to be tempted we all go
 7:30
 through these times every believer goes through these times so um it's 
important
 7:38
 to to to understand that so that you don't feel timid about sharing your
 7:44
 testimony now if you're going through that attack maybe wait to share the 
testimony have that understanding um
 7:50
 this is just an attack but I'm still free you know but maybe wait to have
 7:55
 victory over that you know so you can speak with such confidence and and
 boldness and on the side of Victory
 8:02
 rather than in the middle of the battle um now it's okay it's it's great though
 8:09
 it can be a a a testimony in itself of
 8:15
 speaking of overcoming the devil's attacks like you can share that you can 
share I was delivered I was set let's
 8:22
 let's just use suicidal thoughts for for an example I was delivered from 
Suicidal Thoughts they disappeared completely and
 8:29
 really emphasize that freedom sometimes when people share testimonies 
they're not giving it justice what God has done
 8:36
 they're moving on too quickly they're you know really or maybe it 
happened a long time ago or maybe you know right
 8:43
 now you're you're um in the middle of a different battle so it's like you're
 8:49
 wrongly not valuing not remembering what God did right so when you 
share your testimony it's important
 8:56
 to like renew your mind and remember remember when you were first 
delivered
 9:01
 and what that felt like when all of a sudden that oppression was gone you 
know
 9:06
 renew your mind because you can forget just how joyous and Heaven on
 9:15
 Earth that was you know so when you want to share your testimony it's 
important
 9:21
to really share it well like share it with Excellence you know not share it
 9:26
 casually so make sure you're you're you're you're
 9:31
 really doing it justice you know um expressing well really the miracle that
 9:38
 God did so you can say I was delivered and my life was changed
 9:45
 forever I have so much peace now and all the thoughts completely left and 
then maybe you had an attack later on maybe
 9:51
 months later all of a sudden the devil attacked you with suicidal thoughts 
and this was just an attack it was a testing
 9:56
 time and then they ceased once you rejected the devil's lies you know you 
can share um you know I was I
 10:05
 experienced the enemy angry that I was delivered and he tried to um send 
me
 10:11
 Suicidal Thoughts attacks but I knew it wasn't demons from within this 
time I
 10:16
 knew it was just an attack and it was a testing for me so I I I had been
 10:21
 equipped by the teachings um where I'm planted for example and so I I 
was
 10:28
 serious about rejecting the devil Devil's lies and I just kept rejecting them 
and they fleed just like the Bible
 10:34
 said just like the teaching that I was equipped with
 10:40
 had share spoken uh revealed um and they were gone
 10:46
 completely so and now I don't have any any suicidal thoughts at all so like 
you can share a testimony like that but I
 10:53
 would just say like make sure you're really emphasizing God over the devil
you're giving glory to to God over the
 10:59
 devil you're you're emphasizing the Deliverance more than the attack of 
the
 11:05
 devil being angry sometime and sometimes maybe it's best to just not even
 talk about the attack yeah it it just depends
 11:12
 I mean sometimes you can feel in your heart this is really going to help 
somebody I want to talk about how the enemy tried to come back but how 
I had
 11:19
 Victory then share that you know but what I'm just saying is when you 
when you're going to share your testimony
 11:24
 like let's say you only have a short amount of time to share it make sure 
you're giving Justice to the testimony
 11:30
 you know make sure you're really emphasizing what God did and not 
giving
 11:36
 the devil like too much air time you know like re make sure you're taking
 11:42
 your time to really emphasize what God has done amen okay so another 
time where
 11:48
 it may not be right to share your testimony is sensitive stuff sensitive stuff 
where
 11:57
 um maybe to like like put someone on blast you
 12:02
 know like a someone who abused you or something mistreated you maybe 
to put someone on blast you know
 12:11
 that that might not be what like necessary there's certain things that
 12:17
 you can share the testimony without like putting someone on blast because
 we want to show love to people we want to show
 12:22
love to our en enemies we don't want to ever be in the in the um
 12:30
 the we don't want to have the accusing spirit because you can let like let's 
just giving me for an
 12:37
 example like I talk about my enemies sometimes like I talk about how I 
have
 12:42
 enemies how um people have done horrible things to me but I don't like 
say their
 12:49
 name or I don't paint the picture of who they are I don't I don't say it with a
 12:54
 heart of like I want people to try to figure out who I'm talking about um 
you know like
 13:03
 you know just with what you share you you want to make sure you have 
that Heart of Love and heart that's really
 13:10
 abiding by God's word of loving your enemies so it's important for me to 
talk about how I have enemies how I've had
 13:17
 enemies how people have done mean things to me because as part of a te 
my testimony it's it's me sharing about
 13:22
 persecution and how um God fought my battles for me and how I 
overcame it so
 13:28
 it's really important for for me to talk about it to talk about the fact that I've
 had enemies that did awful evil
 13:33
 things to me I could even speak in detail what those things were 
sometimes when it's God's timing and everything
 13:39
 but I I should when I share I should have the heart of I don't want any 
harm
 13:45
 to come to this person that I'm talking about like the enemies I simply want
 what I'm sharing
13:51
 to edify people to lift them up to help them I don't want another thing to be
 13:59
 happening like them like trying to figure out who it is and like going and
 14:05
 thinking bad towards this person you know so when you share your 
testimony
 14:10
 you should have that heart and that that um that wisdom that wisdom like 
you can
 14:18
 share things where nothing's missed without
 14:23
 um putting someone on blast I guess is the way to say it or putting even 
even if they truly did bad things we don't
 14:30
 need to draw attention to it and um say look this person did bad things to 
me
 14:37
 type thing you know um yeah so that's that's another important thing and 
then
 14:43
 just just having this this uh heart of making sure that I don't I'm not
 14:49
 going to harm anybody or anything or that people would think something 
wrong or negative about anybody or you know
 14:59
 even when you're sharing your testimony to make sure that you're sharing 
the information that's important to share
 15:06
 for like you're not leaving things out you know to to to leave room for 
people to be thinking well why why where was
 15:15
 this why why didn't this happen or why didn't this you know like this is 
what I mean let me just give an example um
 15:24
 like here here's just an example you could maybe say I was delivered at I 
church and then um I opened up a door
 15:32
and let more demons come in and then I got even more oppressed and and 
then you could finish the
 15:39
 testimony with like but then I got delivered again and now I'm free um but
 15:44
 someone could be thinking and and and this is also religion like there's a 
lot of
 15:50
 relig there's a lot of religion part of the religious spirit like the religious 
spirit attacks the
 15:57
 work of God attacks the the power of God the true Servants of God 
coming in power the the religious
 16:05
 spirit just like the Pharisees they they weren't happy with Jesus casting out 
demons like all of the attacks toward
 16:11
 Jesus came from his power like the Pharisees not happy about him moving
 in
 16:17
 power and delivering people and healing people like if he wasn't moving in
 power but he was just preaching similarly to
 16:24
 them they would love him probably they would probably invite him to 
speak at their conferences in those times you
 16:31
 know in their Temple um but it was because he was doing something 
greater
 16:37
 than them something different and something greater that's why they had
 16:42
 jealousy jealousy turns to hatred you know so um
 16:48
 so yeah so anyways the religious spirit manifests itself in different ways 
always like having to do with different
 16:55
 aspects of the power of God so here for here's an example
 17:01
 like when I um like I see many times instead of people like rejoicing over
17:07
 someone being set free many times people will ask me questions or will 
get comments on social media like
 17:16
 um like are you following up with this person to make sure that they don't
 17:21
 allow Demons back in and they keep their freedom like it's crazy the the 
you know
 17:27
 on a video of a someone being delivered from a demon instead of rejoicing
 they're immediately thinking that's the
 17:34
 that's the religious spirit that's the Pharisee Spirit that's the same Spirit of 
the Pharisees being like
 17:40
 um being like when the blind man was his eyes
 17:45
 opened up and he was just like but this Jesus is he he's a sinner isn't he a
 17:51
 sinner don't you think he's a sinner he's like they're like questioning the 
blind man they're not rejoicing with him they're not even saying wow bro 
that's
 17:57
 amazing wow that's so awesome that your eyes are opened up now that's
 18:05
 so amazing Hallelujah okay now I have this question
 18:10
 though like we've had these questions about Jesus like what do you think 
no they just they just skipped immediately
 18:19
 to we think he's a sinner is he a sinner is he go he goes against the word of 
God
 18:24
 you know so that's that same Spirit when people can't even rejoice as 
someone say free and they're immediately looking for
 18:30
 the negative they're immediately coming with an accusatory
 18:35
 Spirit um and assuming the worst when the truth is is that I have a forart 
how to maintain
 18:45
 your deliverance sermon series on my YouTube and we send at at we at 
every church
 18:53
 service we announce these the importance of these we have them flashing 
before every event and every Sunday service
 18:59
 before church starts we have a slide saying it's really important watch these
 videos here's a QR code to go to these
 19:04
 videos we follow up with email for anyone who signs up for an event you 
know make sure you watch these videos
 19:11
 every single person who subscribes to our email list we send out an email 
make sure you watch these videos they're very important and this is like 
six-h hour
 19:17
 training of how to maintain your deliverance it goes so in depth um 
anyways you all many of you know this
 19:24
 but um uh yeah so so anyways like back to
 19:30
 what I said if you just said like I was delivered but then I opened up a door
 and um many demons came back and I was
 19:38
 even worse than I was before and but then I got delivered again and that's 
just the end of the testimony then
 19:43
 people could be thinking especially the religious spirit oh must be at that 
church they're not doing their job you
 19:50
 know they're not equipping people they're not um teaching them how to 
maintain their Deliverance they're not
 19:57
 um they're not giving counsel to people when they have questions or when 
they need it you know people can have all
 20:02
 those those questions so that's why I say make sure you're sharing your 
testimony with wisdom because um leaving
 20:09
 out things could um could leave room for
 20:14
 people like asking these questions now on a general testimony like when 
you're just sharing simply I was oppressed and
 20:21
 then I came to this church and I was set free of this this this and this and 
this and this that's fine you don't need to
 20:26
 be thinking about oh do I have to share all these things like as long as 
you're giving glory to God and also honor where
 20:34
 honor is due like sharing where you receive the Deliverance not just saying
 like God delivered me but share I went
 20:40
 to this church where God's power was moving maybe this this servant of 
God
 20:45
 prayed for me for example and then I received Freedom that's so important
 because the anointing is rare so it's
 20:50
 like in the times of Peter if they weren't saying if someone left the meeting 
on of Peter where was you know
 20:57
 they came under his shadow when all were healed and delivered it's like if 
they left them the service and they told somebody God deliver me of this 
and
 21:04
 they're like wow I wish I could have that but they don't know where to go 
they you have to position yourself where
 21:09
 the anointing is Flowing to um receive Deliverance it's it's for the most 
part
 21:15
 it's not just coming from you just asking God and God coming like from 
the sky and delivering you so um that's why
 21:21
 that's what's really important too oh and back to what I was saying before 
make sure you're not having an accusatory spirit with anything like you
 21:29
 can someone maybe did something wrong to you maybe somebody abused
 you or something but um when you're sharing
 21:36
 don't have the accusatory sphere even if you're not saying their name um 
but just
 21:41
 don't have that in your heart of this like accusatory um kind of heart 
because the
 21:47
 Devil is a is the accuser of the Brethren so um it's important we don't ever 
like
 21:56
 have that Spirit when we're like publicly testifying of course you can talk 
with your close friends whom God
 22:02
 has called you to bring close and your leader especially about sharing this 
person did this wrong thing to me like
 22:08
 that's important to do not to just like keep it to yourself thinking oh I can't 
accuse anybody but I'm talking about
 22:14
 like publicly it's not needed it's not necessary to um reveal such details can
 22:21
 I mention my previous religion and my testimony of course yes of course 
by the way speaking of testimonies this a
 22:27
 perfect time to talk about this too I love this new challenge this is truly like
 my word from Sunday about
 22:34
 sharing how be creative to share your testimony to be creative so that this
 22:40
 test your testimony can reach more people share it with excellence and so 
I've so now um there's this my Revival
 22:47
 hashtag my Revival testimony Challenge and and many of you have 
already done it and I've just loved seeing them and I'm
 22:54
going to be sharing them I love them and I love how this is so beautiful it
 23:01
 reminds me so much of um when Revival broke out with the one minute 
video that
 23:06
 I posted um you know it part of that was like working
 23:14
 hard and being creative and working with Excellence you know like it took
 me a
 23:20
 while to make that video and it took like creative juices like to creative 
thinking you know I put together
 23:27
 different videos showing people being touched By God's power and then at
 the end of the video I prayed over everyone
 23:33
 and that was just a 59c video and it went so viral in a day and a half at 
reached 1 million views at that time I
 23:38
 didn't have hardly any following and then I had a following a a massive 
several thousand following overnight um
 23:46
 which grew to that started on Tik Tok which grew to 1.3 million followers 
on Tik Tok in that same year and then on
 23:53
 every other social media platform as well and that online following LED to
 23:58
 two months later a woman traveling across the country manifesting a 
demon and God
 24:05
 delivering her from the demon at 5f church out in the park that was the 
first time a Deliverance ever happened two months later 300 people came 
to the
 24:13
 park when just a few months later there were few months earlier there was 
just five people few months before that there
 24:19
 was just one person they left in the middle of the sermon 300 people came 
to the park it was overflowing and the Deliverance Revival broke out from
there
 24:26
 and it just expanded wildly from there where last month I ministered at an 
event where 8,000 people came 8,000
 24:33
 people came and encountered God's power and it was the biggest Mass 
deliverance we ever saw in Manila Philippines
 24:39
 Hallelujah um but look it started with uh the prophetic Direction actually 
from
 24:44
 my spiritual father you know this amazing you know we we have to it's so 
important
 24:51
 that we use the tools that God has given us now and um
 24:59
 if you try if we try to do exactly what Billy Graham did it can't
 25:06
 happen I mean like there was like one million people one time that he 
ministered to in person but they didn't
 25:12
 have social media back then so if you you have to adapt to the times
 25:18
 of now so now we can reach people even way more way quicker all over 
the world
 25:25
 people can hear the gospel be healed be delivered you don't have to wait 
wait for a physical meeting physical meetings
 25:31
 are very important of course but I mean um we have to utilize what God is 
what
 25:37
 what is what is here today the technology what the what where the people 
are people are on their phones
 25:42
 people are on social media so you have to go there to reach the people 
because the people are there God
 25:50
 wants us to go there you know so um if I had take that prophetic word
25:57
 seriously and done it with creativity and excellence and working hard it 
wouldn't
 26:04
 have happened you know that the the the Revival wouldn't have broken out
 so
 26:11
 um this past Sunday if you didn't see the Sunday's message go watch it at 
fivefold church on my YouTube you can
 26:17
 see it under live but I shared how the way this revival is going to expand
 26:23
 massively to reach to where God wants us to reach
 26:28
 because we've just begun he wants to take his Global Revival so much 
higher and reach so many more
 26:38
 people um but the way that'll happen is when we share our fruits share our 
testimonies rather than waiting for man
 26:46
 to open up a door to validate to endorse but to share the fruits and the
 26:52
 testimonies that's how it happened in Jesus's times he didn't wait for
 26:57
 Pharisees to open up a door for him to invite him to a conference of theirs 
or something
 27:02
 in those times for them to say something like everyone should follow Jesus
 he's a
 27:09
 true prophet of our time and not just a true Prophet he's the Messiah and 
you will receive healing and deliverance and
 27:15
 eternal life and Abundant Life when you go receive from his ministry 
Pharisees
 27:20
 didn't do that and Jesus didn't sit around like waiting for them to do that 
um he just did the work and people
 27:28
shared their testimonies the people didn't the people got busy themselves 
they shared their testimonies they
 27:33
 shared the fruit and that's how the the the the gospel was spread Revival 
spread
 27:39
 to this day where it's the largest religion in the world onethird of the 
religion of one-third of the
 27:45
 world calls thems a Christian so Jesus didn't get there by man Pharisees
 27:54
 leaders leaders in the Church of that day opening doors for him he got 
there
 27:59
 by doing the work and people the Army got got it there got got it to spread 
by
 28:06
 sharing their fruit sharing their testimonies and so we got to do that today 
but when we
 28:12
 do it today we got to do it in the way that's the most effective you know 
and so I love anyways this this I love this
 28:19
 my Revival testimony it reminds me so much of the first video that I made 
because it was a short video because you
 28:25
 know we know how people are like well it's not like we we can't ever 
make long videos long videos are important to
 28:31
 share like all the details and stuff and people watch them I have longer 
videos that have many many views like more than
 28:38
 one million views way more than one million views I you know not to say 
no long videos but it's important that we
 28:45
 also make sure we're doing we're putting excellence and hard work and 
creativity towards short short videos concise
 28:52
 videos um so yeah so there's this my Revival testimony um challenge that I
28:57
 challenge all of you to do and um for all the rules of it you can go to
 29:05
 my recent post of Chisum um that I posted like two days ago so if you can
 29:11
 just scroll through my Instagram you'll find in the caption all of the Like 
rules the rules are just that it would
 29:17
 be under a minute and a half but if like it goes a little bit more don't worry 
about it like you don't have to like
 29:24
 really stress about it um it's fine but at least that it keeps it short on
 29:31
 the shorter side when you have that in mind um and also that you would 
put
 29:36
 pictures and videos of your before and after and I love seeing those I'm just
 even seeing the power in that because
 29:43
 it's it's really putting Excellence to the testimony because it's it's like
 29:50
 really helping make it real for people you know and also more interesting 
to
 29:55
 watch because people are people and they can maybe we get bored just 
watching a
 30:00
 person talking just their face but you put pictures and videos from the past 
look this is how I was before that can
 30:06
 draw people in to be thinking of these things is is really Excellence for the 
kingdom you know to really be thinking
 30:11
 how can we reach people the best how can we go where they are today 
how can we go where people are with their short
 30:17
 attention spans and what they're looking for how can we go how can we 
reach them there that's how this revival began with
 30:24
that one minute testimony or one minute video that I made so
 30:29
 um yeah it's amazing so I encourage you all to do that covered what does it
 mean to be covered by you Apostle leading 5f
 30:37
 church as we are planted so this is a principle in the kingdom of God that 
God is calling all
 30:43
 of his children to be planted in one Church specifically the church he's 
calling them to be where will he call
 30:49
 them to be where he where will he call you to be he will call you to be 
planted at his true church where he is truly
 30:55
 anointed a servant of God not someone just anointed themselves but he's 
truly anointed them how do you know someone's
 31:01
 anointed by God by their fruits the Bible says you shall know them by 
their fruits so what what are fruits fruits
 31:07
 are number one the character of someone that they have the fruits of the 
spirit that they are humble that they are full
 31:15
 of love for everybody including enemies that they are full of compassion 
that
 31:20
 they are generous that they are selfless um that they are gentle uh that they
 31:26
 have self-control uh that they exhibit the fruits of the spirit they look like
 31:32
 Jesus in their character and then number two that they look like Jesus in 
their Ministry that their Ministry looks like
 31:39
 Jesus's Ministry Jesus was preaching the gospel but with power he's 
speaking with authority people were amazed at his
 31:46
 teaching that he was teaching with authority and it wasn't entertainment it 
wasn't just this normal teaching that
 31:51
they're used to hearing but it was spoken with authority and simplicity um 
and and and Jesus was also Healing The
 31:58
 Sick and casting out demons he was walking in miracles signs and 
wonders and so these are the fruits you should
 32:05
 be looking for so God will speak to you where you're supposed to be 
planted according to wisdom using this wisdom
 32:11
 when you see these things he's going to be calling you there now if you see
 many different churches that have these
 32:17
 things these fruits then it's important to see where God is changing you 
where
 32:23
 you've seen transformation where you're encountering God and also that 
knowing in your spirit the S of voice where God
 32:30
 will be speaking to you this is where you're called you it also may be this 
feeling of feeling of
 32:37
 just like the vision aligns with your heart like your heart is so passionate
 32:43
 to see people encounter God's power to be set free to really have their eyes
 open to God's love to be surrendered
 32:50
 because so many people so many Christians are lukewarm going through 
the motions and maybe you have
 32:55
 encountered God's love and now you're you're surrendered so the church 
where God is calling you
 33:01
 to be perhaps maybe that's your heart and you see this is the vision of this 
church this is what's happening at this
 33:07
 church people's eyes are opening up and they're going from lukewarm to 
surrender here they're really knowing God's love
 33:12
 not just going through the emotions alter call raising their hand up yes 
saying yes I give my life to Jesus but
 33:18
 they're not changing and they're not it's not really a true surrender you 
know so that's how you'll know so once
 33:24
 you're planted it's a principle it's a principle in the Kingdom that when you 
are planted where you are planted you
 33:30
 will be equipped there you will be equipped to have victory over the devil 
you will be equipped to be a
 33:37
 mature child of God and you will be equipped to be a powerful vessel of 
God
 33:42
 who walks in the anointing who can fulfill their purpose so equipping 
happens where happens where
 33:48
 you're planted also prophetic Direction happens where you're planted 
corporately
 33:56
 personally where there's God will speak through your leader for your life 
in the teachings
 34:03
 and then at times it could be personally one onone um and and and and 
that's God's
 34:10
 ways that's God's order he knows where you're planted where he's called 
you to be planted and he'll specifically choose to speak the prophetic 
Direction Through
 34:16
 Your Leader not through other voices and many times not just to you 
personally
 34:21
 but like he'll he'll literally bring that word the prophetic word Through 
Your Leader that's how he'll bring it to you
 34:28
 and so that's his way so if you're going different places if you're not 
planted in one place you'll miss out on God's
 34:34
ways you'll miss out on his voice you'll miss out on his voice because God 
is Not
 34:40
 adapting and manipulated manipulated to however you want to hear him 
speak he speaks in the ways that he wants to
 34:47
 speak in his ways and his principles another thing that happens when 
you're planted a principle like one of the
 34:54
 gifts that God gives when you are planted is that you will be protected 
protected you will have covering you will the same anointing that is 
casting
 35:01
 out demons at the church you're planted in the same anointing that's been 
changing your life transforming your life bringing miracles in your life 
that
 35:08
 same anointing becomes a covering over you is a covering of protection 
over you in the
 35:14
 spiritual realm where demons literally see it and demons literally know 
they can't mess with you there's a difference
 35:20
 between someone who is not covered or maybe they're planted somewhere
 where the anointing is not they can be
 35:25
 susceptible to curses coming upon them to even which I've I've I've I've 
literally had a pastor one time because
 35:32
 the anoint the anointing was not there but the pastor like in his life you 
know God was calling him to to to receive
 35:39
 impartation and and have a covering but this they went and they prayed the
 35:44
 pastor went and prayed for a witch and ever since then these curses Came 
Upon their
 35:50
 life so I've seen and I've seen this many times I've seen Christians who like
 they weren't opening
35:57
 up doors to the devil but they experienced curses coming upon their lives 
witches doing curses upon them
 36:05
 that's because God doesn't go against his ways he doesn't go against his 
principles his principle his way of
 36:11
 releasing protection C the anointing of protection over them is by being 
planted
 36:18
 where true anointing is so when we don't do that we don't receive that 
protection
 36:27
 so um and there can be Grace there's I mean there's definitely Grace when 
you don't know when you don't know I mean um
 36:34
 but like when you don't when you're not aware of this there can be Grace 
where it's not like every Christian's
 36:39
 definitely going to be cursed by all these witches just because they're not 
planted where the anointing is I'm not
 36:45
 saying that there's Grace but once your eyes have opened up it's
 36:51
 like when the Bible says when you're when you're entrusted with a when 
when
 36:56
 your responsibility I'm going to paraphrase a scripture right now but the 
word says that your responsibility
 37:04
 increases the more that God entrust to you um
 37:09
 so like when you know better there's
 37:17
 not all as much grace there than there used to be if that makes sense when 
you
 37:22
 know better you need to obey God when you don't know better and you 
open up a
37:29
 door but you don't know you're opening up a door there's a different kind 
of Grace there because God is simply so
 37:34
 good and he understands amen um so so yeah that
 37:42
 covering comes upon you when you plant yourself when you make that 
Covenant I
 37:47
 am planted here and you also act as you were planted as if you were
 37:53
 really planted like you do what it means to be planted you you you don't 
listen all over different places but you are a
 38:00
 a faithful loyal disciple who is faithful
 38:05
 to the teachings being released who is taking them seriously listening to 
them
 38:11
 and not just one time and taking notes and renewing their Renewing Your 
Mind with these with what with what's being released and applying them 
in your life
 38:18
 and you're also contributing to this work of God you're giving back and 
you're sewing into this work of God because you want to not just take up
 38:25
 space you want to be a part of this revival Army to help this work of God 
go forward um so you're contributing you're
 38:31
 sewing you're tithing um and also you're serving you're serving you're 
you're
 38:37
 you're doing your part to help Advance the work by serving in the areas 
you can
 38:43
 and for many this for many of you if you don't know how to serve it's 
sharing your testimony it's sharing what God's
 38:49
 doing on like online especially sharing videos and everything to the best of
your ability when someone has received
 38:56
 some received Deliverance but they're still finding a certain oppression in 
their life so this is the
 39:02
 simple answer if you ever encountered this for everybody watch my video 
how to receive
 39:10
 complete deliverance on YouTube and come April 1st this book is going to
 be so
 39:17
 important um I go I expand even more on how to receive complete 
deliverance but
 39:22
 this video that I have put on YouTube my video my book coming out is 
called un lock your deliverance by the
 39:28
 way um coming out April 1st 2025 next year but now on YouTube I have 
this
 39:34
 video how to receive complete deliverance and I go over many different 
keys that are needed
 39:42
 to unlock Deliverance so sometimes people think it's just one
 39:47
 and done you just you go to the church and you have the problem and then 
that's it it's just like going to the doctor or
 39:54
 something you get the prescription you have the medicine and you're that's
 good you're good but there can be many
 40:00
 factors as to why a person's not seeing the Breakthrough many different 
factors
 40:06
 sometimes it's they're not fully surrendered sometimes it's that they haven't
 closed all the doors to the devil in their life sometimes it's that
 40:13
 they need to believe that they have been set free and keep confessing I am 
free I
40:19
 have been delivered and keep on rejecting the devil's lies and and they
 40:25
 will see it manifest and they just need to keep going sometimes it's that 
they
 40:31
 need to use other keys to unlock their Deliverance as I share in how to 
receive complete deliverance on my YouTube
 40:37
 there's um many different Keys it's not
 40:43
 always just coming to where God's power is and renouncing there's even 
more keys and I go over those keys um in that
 40:51
 message so when if a person can really I I don't
 40:57
 leave things out if a person can really be serious about these Keys released
 41:04
 take them to heart apply them they will see complete
 41:09
 deliverance amen if you have heard voices for so long and then you get 
delivered it's
 41:15
 like it's like if you can picture Egypt being a land of Oppression hearing 
the
 41:23
 those voices of the devil and then you're delivered once you're delivered 
you get on a boat that's right next to
 41:29
 where you were delivered and you're headed now to the promised land 
promised land
 41:37
 is meaning like far from when you were oppressed Devils had to totally 
flee
 41:43
 your life really experiencing peace and joy an abundance never area and 
walking in
 41:50
 your purpose so if this is this is Egypt
41:56
 oppressed land this is this is the boat this is the boat so when you first 
leave
 42:02
 you can still hear the voices of Egypt you can still hear the city the the cars
 42:10
 honking you can see the city lights but as you keep going in
 42:16
 obedience and surrender and doing everything that I teach and how to 
maintain your deliverance it gets quieter and quieter
 42:24
 the sights and sounds of the city until eventually you can't you can't
 42:29
 see the city anymore or hear the city anymore that's how it is in the
 42:36
 spiritual realm so um many people experienced that if they've been in 
Egypt for a long time if they've been
 42:41
 hearing voices for a long time the devil really is not happy that they're
 42:48
 free because they've been with him so long not with him but they've been 
oppressed by him for so long they've
 42:53
 been in his land like oppressed land Egypt land for so long so he can try to 
send loud loud loud voices still but
 43:00
 it's not demons from within it's outward they're delivered but you still hear 
the sound so it's much better in the boat
 43:08
 but you can still hear and see Egypt because it was just right there you 
know that's how it is in the spiritual realm
 43:14
 so you got to be aware of that so you can be this a true warrior of Christ 
ready to fight the good fight of faith
 43:20
 not give into the lies and know that every day you're every day the the 
devil has to diminish I mean his his his
 43:27
 attacks as you surrender and stay in
43:32
 obedience I'm trying to imagine the flow of the anointing right now I 
imagine it's flowing from God down to Prophet
 43:38
 Jord ay then you Apostle Katherine then to us is that the right visual 
visualization yeah that's impartation
 43:44
 that's impartation that's exactly what was happening with Elisha um God
 43:50
 released the anointing to Elijah and then Elijah in obedience to God poured
 43:56
 out what God had given Elijah to Elisha and
 44:02
 now that direct anointing from God was now in Elisha you know and even 
more
 44:08
 even greater portion because it's God's will that we would go glory to glory
 Jesus said to his disciples you will do
 44:14
 greater things you will do greater things than what I did so you know Jesus
 44:20
 wasn't um Jesus did not want to have the reputation of when he was on this
 Earth
 44:26
 he did the most amazing Miracles he wanted it's
 44:31
 him doing it still but through people now through it's inv he's invisible now
 he was visible before but that's how
 44:37
 humble Jesus is that he wanted to do even greater things through Peter 
Paul
 44:44
 and us today Hallelujah but yeah that's that's how
 44:50
 impartation Works yes yes Hallelujah hence
 44:55
 why um the enemy tries so hard to attack and
 45:00
 bring persecution um to my spiritual father because the devil knows full 
well how it
 45:06
 works in the spiritual realm the devil wanted so badly for me
 45:12
 to um to leave my spiritual father I could never do that but the devil really
 45:17
 wanted that because he knows exactly how things work in the spiritual 
realm and this is God's will so I can't
 45:25
 I can't I can't stress this enough so many I mean so many people are 
missing
 45:30
 out on walking in their purpose on receiving miracles on hearing God's 
voice simply because they don't want to
 45:36
 do things God's ways I can't stress this enough that God does not adapt to 
us
 45:43
 being religious he does not adapt to us like trying to do things differently
 45:50
 because we're uncomfortable with God's ways he doesn't adapt and be 
manipulated by us you just won't see the fruit the
 45:58
 the Miracles the the anointing it's so simple I mean I just
 46:04
 can't get over how simple it is because I just see all these people in the 
world
 46:11
 who are prideful or skeptical or you know and they're simply not they're
 46:16
 oppressed still and they're not I see ministers who are this way and they're 
not walking in the anointing in their
 46:22
 Ministries and then I see someone like Pastor Heather who comes just 
humbly and she's is just immediately seeing God use
 46:29
 her in power and it just increase and so many people be delivered in her 
church it's so simple like if every minister in
 46:37
the world right now could be like a child and be humble and do things 
God's ways and Comm and receive impartation
 46:45
 from anointed Servants of God they their Ministries would be flourishing 
and the people in their
 46:51
 Church would be set free and healed it is so simple and if people would 
just
 46:57
 humbly come to where God's power is position themselves there every 
person
 47:03
 could be delivered from demons in this world every Christian could be free
 every person who came to the church
 47:10
 could be free could be healed could walk in abundance could be anointed 
vessels of God it is so simple and so many of
 47:16
 you have received so easily so quickly so effortlessly like you just came 
into the church and the that first day you
 47:22
 came you were delivered and you're seeing your life flourishing you're 
seeing the anointing of God in your life
 47:29
 moving through you like maybe I know many of you found it to be quite 
simple and quick and effortless especially
 47:35
 considering your whole Christian Life maybe you've like struggled and so 
much and then just coming to where the anointing was boom so fast so
 47:42
 effortlessly so quick it's so simple and man if we do things God's ways it's 
so
 47:49
 simple that's why the devil fights God's ways so much God's ways like 
God's ways
 47:56
 offends the Rel religious spirit so much you know the way of God of 
releasing impartation the way of God of moving in
 48:03
anointing and making demons tremble um the way of God of using weak 
and foolish
 48:09
 things the way of God of using who he wants like such as my spiritual 
father who's from Tanzania East Africa he's my
 48:15
 spiritual father you know weak and foolish thing and like not a
 48:23
 common societal way of having um equipping and training spiritually it
 48:30
 would be to go to Seminary school for example you know so people can 
think things when they see me you know
 48:36
 religious things in that in that way um God's ways the devil fights God's 
ways
 48:43
 God's ways uh religion through the spirit of religion because the devil
 48:49
 knows that if people would just come in an alignment with God's
 48:54
 ways it's like it's like taking the cord and plugging it into the outlet
 49:03
 and there's immediately Power and there's the light comes on and that's all 
you need to do you know you're
 49:09
 struggling so much why have you have you ever done that like why isn't 
this coming on why what's wrong is is my TV
 49:16
 not working is the lamp not working is what is the phone not charging is 
my
 49:21
 curling iron not working have you ever done that and you're like oh I didn't
 plug it in
 49:27
 Hallelujah so that's what how people are they're like I'm praying I'm 
praying why aren't I seeing Miracles why why am I
 49:34
 not seeing healing why am I not seeing Deliverance why am I not 
flourishing my life why why what's wrong I have I have
49:41
 the word of God I have the Holy Spirit I I'm reading the word of God I 
have it
 49:47
 you know you have the the curling iron you have the the the the thing that 
you
 49:53
 need to do the the job but you don't have the power you got to Simply plug
 49:58
 into the power God's ways plug into the power do do things God's ways to 
be able
 50:04
 to plug in the power come be planted at a church where God's power
 50:10
 is humble yourself so that you can actually receive through a weak and 
foolish vessel plug into the power it's
 50:17
 as simple as that Hallelujah does the devil know God's
 50:23
 timing the devil um he he he
 50:28
 hears it depends it depends on what God wants to make
 50:34
 public um so for example
 50:41
 um there was like there was one prophecy that my spiritual father had 
given um
 50:48
 one time I remember at his church I was there it was and and it say he says
 in
 50:55
 six years this will take place so whenever things are spoken in the
 51:03
 public like church for example the devil can hear mostly
 51:10
 because there could be some people who have um demonic oppression 
there and
 51:17
 they and then they're set free and what the demon heard and um the demon
reports
 51:25
 to the devil um but that's not to say like
 51:31
 oh we should never say anything no who cares like I mean we shouldn't 
have that
 51:37
 feeling of like oh demons are hearing right now no who cares I
 51:42
 mean when God wants something to be released publicly it means that he's
 totally okay with the devil knowing like
 51:48
 the de like God's not concerned about the devil like like stopping it the
 51:54
 devil can never stop it God is in control so yeah I mean the devil can like 
try to
 51:59
 stop it he can try to bring attacks to stop it but when God says yes nobody 
can say no when it's God's timing for
 52:05
 something to happen um the devil can't stop it so that's why I mean who 
cares
 52:11
 like who cares that demons heard that the devil heard who cares but that 
that
 52:17
 being said um you really have to walk in wisdom as well like as a as a 
leader
 52:24
 like like me like there's things that I that I can that
 52:29
 are good to share but that there's things there's wisdom to not like it's not 
necessary to speak
 52:35
 publicly um simply because of how the enemy could bring unnecessary 
attack um
 52:42
 towards this thing if that makes sense so yeah in terms of leaders it's just
 52:48
important to walk in wisdom to not just like reveal every little thing but 
reveal what God is saying to reveal so
 52:56
 the devil does know God's timing for certain things when it's God saying 
yes it's okay to release this
 53:02
 publicly um so so yeah but this but this can be on a
 53:10
 like if you that's what I mean part of the reason why you shouldn't just 
bring
 53:16
 anyone in close is if someone has demons like and you speak something 
the demon
 53:22
 can then report to the kingdom the devil's Kingdom the demon in 
somebody can report to the devil's Kingdom once
 53:29
 again this doesn't mean oh I just need to be mute around my family 
member for example who you know has demonic
 53:35
 oppression I don't mean like that I just mean sharing things that are only
 53:41
 supposed to be shared with whom God is calling you to bring in really 
close or your spiritual parent for example you
 53:47
 don't need to be telling everybody everything all of your business all of the
 the things God's revealed to you the
 53:53
 secrets God's revealed to you you know it's like the wisdom that I use 
when um
 53:59
 when I knew God had spoken to me through a prophet through my 
spiritual father
 54:04
 Prophet J Davy my calling um that I was called to be an
 54:09
 apostle and I was called to reach the Nations and everything [Music]
 54:15
 um I didn't go and speak that to everybody uh I I I I ended up soon after
54:25
 not immediately after but soon after maybe it was I don't remember the 
first time I shared it publicly but even
 54:31
 that was with wisdom like there's no need for me to share it the very next 
day you know this is what a prophet
 54:38
 prophesied to me there's no need for that and that could have brought 
unnecessary attack towards me
 54:44
 when I was in a sensitive stage of just receiving the
 54:51
 prophecy I had this wisdom that God gave me in that like when I received 
this prophecy I had this understanding like a
 54:57
 lot of people won't get this most people will not get this I'm going to share 
this with my parents because they can be trusted they have pure hearts not 
one
 55:03
 time have they been like I think you heard God wrong Catherine or um no 
God's
 55:09
 saying this Katherine they've never been like not one time had they been 
like prideful and skeptical you know so I
 55:18
 knew I could share with them and I knew how they respond I knew just 
based on their character like I knew they would
 55:24
 when I told them I know God has spoken to me me they're going to believe
 it and not discourage me so I told my parents
 55:31
 and um I think that was pretty much it first um I just had this wisdom I 
knew
 55:38
 glory to God by his grace I had the wisdom God gave me the wisdom in 
that moment like there's no need to be
 55:45
 sharing with people you start sharing this with people people are going to 
start thinking you're weird they're not going to understand it they can start
55:50
 saying you're wrong and that's just going to bring all this heaviness and 
attack from the enemy when this is
 55:56
 supposed to to be such a joyful moment such a Divine precious holy
 56:01
 moment so don't Tain it and pollute it by letting people speak negatively to
 56:08
 this beautiful thing you know so it's like Mary went away with Elizabeth 
for
 56:16
 months she protected the baby in her Jesus she
 56:23
 protected that message from the angel for in the beginning stages you 
know in that
 56:28
 sensitive time so yeah so that's how take that wisdom
 56:36
 you know with with what you share with people if your prophecy is 
streamed on
 56:42
 YouTube and IG and everyone is watching does the same apply no I mean 
that's you know just like I
 56:49
 shared there was a prophecy my spiritual father gave where he said six 
years this will happen to his church
 56:56
 so that was supposed to be public so there are prophecies that are supposed
 to be
 57:02
 public that it's it's not like a danger or anything if if you're if the leader
 57:07
 if the prophet or Apostle is prophesying something in public it's meant to 
be public it's not like um something to
 57:14
 feel weird about that it's that is public for people to see for my situation it 
was so unique because it
 57:20
 was a prophet from across the world who I didn't know and I you know
57:26
 and and so many people in everyone in my life didn't understand um that 
there are
 57:32
 prophets today and everything for I'm just talking about like personally for 
me a family member is skeptic but kind
 57:39
 of open she wonders why is it that demons start manifesting after you tell 
people if they feel manifestations they
 57:45
 can come forward to the altar is it because demons know the order couple 
different things
 57:53
 so when someone comes where the anointing is when someone comes 
where the anointing
 57:59
 is moving a church service for example um demons recognize it
 58:04
 immediately and some especially if the demons are a lower level
 58:10
 demon they cannot even stay through the service through the sermon 
without
 58:15
 manifesting it's like it's like it's so uncomfortable for them it's
 58:22
 like it's like sitting in a room that's like 300 100° you know it's
 58:28
 like it's like putting your hand on the stove or something you know what I 
mean like they are feeling the heat they're
 58:35
 feeling the anointing it's the anointing is is meant to evict
 58:42
 demons it's so powerful so they're feeling that it's like a fight for them
 58:47
 to stay so that's why you see sometimes demons manifest in the middle of 
service
 58:53
 sometimes it just happened two weeks ago I was preaching and I saw saw 
a woman manifesting so much and the Holy Spirit
59:01
 led me to just stop the sermon and pray for her in that moment because it 
was just time for her to be free and she
 59:07
 didn't need to be suffering with manifestations you know um she could be 
free right then and there there are
 59:12
 other times though where maybe someone may be feel manifestations but 
it's not it's tolerable and God may want just the
 59:20
 them to be delivered after the sermon so there's a lot of people that come to
 fold church and I mean they testify about it they testify that they feel
 59:26
 really hot or they feel they literally can feel maybe they feel nauseous they 
can feel the
 59:33
 manifestations happening during the sermon but maybe they're not 
showing it per se there's many so many people like
 59:39
 every Sunday for example there are probably several people who are 
literally feeling the
 59:46
 manifestations immediately during worship during the sermon um some 
get delivered in the
 59:52
 middle of the sermon there's even been people testifying that without me 
even even commanded the demon to go the demon
 59:57
 just left they felt it leave during the sermon um the ones demons that do 
that
 1:00:03
 where they just leave with during the sermon without me commanding 
them those are lower level demons because there's
 1:00:09
 different levels of demons so those are the ones that they are the least
 1:00:14
 powerful so they cannot even fight to stay during the sermon they get close
 to
 1:00:20
anointing and they have to immediately go that's the power of the 
anointing that's how it that's how it is on these live streams too people are 
just
 1:00:26
 watching the sermon and they're getting delivered they're without even a 
prayer being spoken yet praise God
 1:00:33
 um so then there's a lot of like medium level demons and then sometimes 
there will be high level demons and so the
 1:00:40
 high level demons are the ones where sometimes more keys are needed it's
 it's absolutely necessary for the person to
 1:00:46
 renounce a person needs to specifically renounce saying I want to die for
 1:00:52
 example um if they have said that like because so so many times I just
 1:00:57
 command demons to go for example but other times I may ask someone do
 you want to do you want to renounce or Holy
 1:01:05
 Spirit Will Reveal to me they've made a demonic Covenant like saying I 
want to die so Holy Spirit Will Lead me this is
 1:01:10
 the key that unlocks our deliverance they need to renounce this and then 
there's other Keys as well that I go
 1:01:17
 over in how to receive complete deliverance sermon a message on my 
YouTube um Link in my bio for that as
 1:01:24
 well so um so anyways it's God it's God's order too so
 1:01:33
 generally God wants the word of God to go forth so people can be
 1:01:39
 equipped they need the word the word's very important and so that they 
can hear the
 1:01:45
 gospel and then generally after the word this is when God then wants to do
 the majority of his
 1:01:53
works of miracles signs wonders delance healing so by me saying okay 
everyone
 1:01:59
 come forward now if you sense this manifestation it's me knowing and 
following the lead of the Holy Spirit me
 1:02:06
 knowing God wants to do this now God wants to deliver his people now 
many of his people now he's delivered some
 1:02:11
 already but he wants to deliver many of his people now and in that regard 
the anointing will just start moving
 1:02:18
 powerfully in that moment so that's why the demons start shrieking and 
screaming it's also it
 1:02:24
 could be a a ation two of demons knowing their time is up knowing the 
sermon is over it's time to this is the time that
 1:02:32
 they go it can also be that I'm freaking out it was so powerful in the 
Philippines like as soon as the sermon
 1:02:38
 was over I don't think I hardly said anything I don't and then just
 1:02:44
 immediately just start hearing people shrieking all of a sudden before I 
said like if you're manifesting come forward
 1:02:51
 people were just shrieking I mean demons were shrieking all over the 
place all of a sudden it was God was ready to move
 1:02:56
 then God was releasing his anointing in a greater level at that
 1:03:02
 moment so um that's what's happening the meaning of higher level demons
 is that
 1:03:09
 there's a scripture in Ephesians 612 that says um the war we are fighting is
 1:03:15
 a spiritual one not a carnal one and it is against principalities against um 
forces against
 1:03:25
um force it lists a bunch of different
 1:03:32
 um different Le what what the the things that's listen principalities forces 
of evil um I'm forgetting the exact words
 1:03:40
 right now but you can Ephesians 612 I believe is what it is um it's actually 
listing different levels of demonic
 1:03:48
 power principalities it means a prince of a region so that's the highest level
 1:03:55
 demon more higher level more power more Authority more power
 1:04:01
 so that's what I what I mean when I say higher level demons is that they 
um they
 1:04:08
 carry more literally more power uh and so in the same way the devil takes
 1:04:14
 everything from God's kingdom like he twists everything from God's 
kingdom like he takes God's principles because he knows they work but 
then he twist
 1:04:21
 them and and uses them for evil the principles so like the principles work 
still but
 1:04:29
 there's not the blessing of God over them if that makes sense there's not the
 blessing of God over them the blessings of God come without sorrow the 
Bible
 1:04:35
 says so the blessings or rewards from the devil come with sorrow so um he
 has
 1:04:42
 a supernatural power the devil has Supernatural power it's nothing 
compared to God's power but he does have a
 1:04:47
 supernatural power so he uses his Supernatural powers and uses them with 
God's principles that's why um like psychic
 1:04:55
 are the tainting the prophets the principle of the prophetic it's it's the
 1:05:01
devil's version um and
 1:05:06
 uh and all of the things like um all the things to look to the Future like
 1:05:12
 astrology and everything is the devil tainting it
 1:05:18
 um so and there's so many things like like the energy the raiki using the
 1:05:27
 hands to heal is like a tainting of laying on of hands and
 1:05:33
 um God's healing power and
 1:05:42
 um people go to witch doctors for healing and freedom so that's a
 1:05:51
 twisting of going to Servants of God who release the power of God to EV 
ICT
 1:05:58
 demons so [Music] um he he just takes from God's kingdom
 1:06:04
 and twists it so in God's kingdom there are different it's a kingdom 
government so there's different levels of anointing
 1:06:10
 and different levels of authorities acts 1911 Paul had extraordinary 
anointing he says he God
 1:06:17
 was doing extraordinary Miracles through the hands of apostle Paul 
extraordinary
 1:06:23
 extraordinary extraordin AR so that means that it was a higher level of
 1:06:29
 anointing higher level Miracles were happening through Paul um so the 
devil
 1:06:36
 took that from God's Kingdom so in God's kingdom that's why it's so 
important we
 1:06:42
 we recognize God's kingdom government God's kingdom government 
order where is the Apostle Paul's of today where is the
 1:06:48
extraordinary anointing of today we need to make sure we're 
acknowledging recognizing Apostle Pauls of today we
 1:06:54
 need to acknowledge and recognize the kingdom of government here on 
this Earth because there's people with high level
 1:07:00
 demons and only the high level anointing can destroy the yolks of those 
highle
 1:07:06
 demons can deliver people from the high level demons it's why it's so 
important that we are united as a body of Christ
 1:07:13
 in one Accord not just all these separate Ministries and everything looking 
out for each
 1:07:19
 other when you do that people stay bound but if we can IGN
 1:07:26
 acknowledge God's kingdom of government here on this Earth then you 
know where to go you know where to lead somebody
 1:07:35
 where to go to receive deliverance from their highlevel demonic 
oppression there it is Ephesians 6:12
 1:07:42
 for we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against the rulers against 
the authorities against the cosmic Powers
 1:07:48
 over this present Darkness against the spiritual forces there's a different 
translation I think it's KJV that
 1:07:53
 actually says the word principalities do animals get demons sometimes 
they can
 1:08:00
 because remember Jesus sent demons into the pigs he sent them out of the 
person
 1:08:07
 because out of the person into the pigs sometimes that can happen where 
the
 1:08:14
 devil uses uh an animal to put a demon in to harm
1:08:20
 someone to try to harm someone not that I don't mean to be afraid of 
animals that's why it's so
 1:08:26
 important you are protected that's why you don't need to worry about 
anything when you're protected when you're covered I mean you need to 
walk in
 1:08:32
 wisdom you need to follow the example of your spiritual leader um but 
you don't
 1:08:38
 need to like the demon when I say the devil can send a demon into an 
animal I'm saying like people who are not
 1:08:45
 covered who do not have o who who who have open doors to Demons 
that's an area maybe the enemy can um have that scheme
 1:08:53
 towards but he can't send a demon and animal to harm someone who
 1:09:00
 is is planted and covered at the same time we don't see Jesus actually 
casting demons out of
 1:09:07
 animals or the apostles so our calling is to cast demons out of
 1:09:13
 people I want to answer this question especially just because um of this uh
 1:09:20
 this amazing thing that God's doing through the Revival testimonies and 
putting pictures and videos on the video
 1:09:27
 uh Lindsay asked not really a spiritual question but what's a good way to 
teach self Te video editing specific apps
 1:09:34
 websites uh well I will just say my own experience I IM movie was free on
 my on
 1:09:40
 my laptop so when I began I just opened that up and started to teach 
myself I think maybe I went on YouTube YouTube
 1:09:48
 like can have for any kind of program you can search on YouTube um it'll 
give
 1:09:55
 basic tips and things but for most editing things whether it's an app on a 
phone or on a
 1:10:03
 computer it's pretty simple to pick up to do the simple things like to put
 1:10:08
 pictures or videos over things so I encourage you to um look on YouTube 
yeah
 1:10:16
 for like um tips how toos if you don't have before or after
 1:10:22
 pictures yeah you totally can can I also partipate in the challenge yeah 
absolutely absolutely you can be
 1:10:28
 creative though if you if you want and maybe put a picture of after like or 
put a picture of you at the church receiving
 1:10:34
 or if you don't have a picture of you at the church receiving you can find 
any picture or video um like screen record a video of a
 1:10:42
 church service at 5f church for example if you got delivered at 5f church 
you could put that in for
 1:10:48
 example if a pastor is Anointed and walks in healing and occasional 
Deliverance does that mean they need
 1:10:55
 more [Music] impartation
 1:11:01
 so in this new move of God in this new wine God has poured out powerful
 1:11:09
 anointing powerful anointing and really God wants everyone
 1:11:16
 to come in alignment with his move and to recognize you know it's kind of
 like we haven't seen in today's time
 1:11:24
 for the most part for the most part we haven't seen like a modern day 
Apostle Paul or Apostle Peter we haven't seen
 1:11:30
those kinds of Miracles those that kind of power God is releasing this now 
God
 1:11:37
 has released this now he has released servants walking in this anointing
 1:11:43
 now so it's very important for everyone really to recognize God's
 1:11:51
 kingdom government here on this Earth what God has released the 
blessing he has released and learn be teachable come into the new
 1:11:58
 wine there are many who have aspects of new wine but not total new wine 
God is releasing his total new wine
 1:12:06
 right now it's here and you're seeing it by the fruits you see it like Apostle 
Paul Apostle Peter it looks like their
 1:12:12
 Ministry for example or it looks like the ministry of Jesus that's how you 
know when it's really looking so much
 1:12:18
 like the Bible come alive you know in every aspect so really God wants 
everyone to
 1:12:24
 be humble and recognize the kingdom government like Apostle Paul 
Apostle
 1:12:30
 Peter of today and learn and submit and receive
 1:12:36
 impartation and you know be United you know recognize oh wow I see 
this
 1:12:42
 powerful anointing moving through this servant of God and the Bible says 
that all who believe these sign shall follow
 1:12:49
 them they shall heal the sick they shall cast out demons I'm not seeing that 
for the most part my Ministry that means I'm missing something well God 
has given
 1:12:55
 this Grace here I'm going to come and be humble and receive start 
listening to the teachings and then and and and and
1:13:02
 acknowledge and and share with the people at my church for example this 
is what God is doing here on this earth now
 1:13:09
 I've been receiving more hallelujah we're going to see Revival break out
