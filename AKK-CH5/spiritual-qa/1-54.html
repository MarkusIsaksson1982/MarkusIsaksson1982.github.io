What is the biggest hindrance for ministers to receive the new wine?
0:01
What is the biggest hindrance for ministers to accept the end time revival and the new wine? The biggest hindrance
0:07
would be pride. Um because what God is doing right now is so unique to what
0:13
anyone has ever seen or what anyone has ever heard of heard ever happening um in
0:20
the history. I mean, in in in recent history where God is coming in such a
0:26
new way, restoring aspects of the church that have been lost for so long.
0:35
Um, it's been I mean, not even in memory of people. If
0:42
if you talk to your parents or grandparents or great-grandparents, they're probably not going to be sharing about um apostles and prophets
0:50
ministering for the most part and describing things that happened in the
0:55
book of Acts like signs and wonders being performed by the apostles for example and really what everything that
1:02
we see in the book of Acts, the deliverance ministry, the way that people were freed and healed with ease
1:08
by the power of God moving through Peter, through Paul, through the triful ministers, you know, it is it is just so
1:15
new in terms of what people are used to, what people have seen, what people's parents have
1:22
seen, grandparents have seen. So, um it's like it it sometimes if there's not
1:30
humility, it it can be really hard for for people to accept something that's new and
1:37
different. When there's humility there, you can like read the word of God
1:42
differently. You can see how God would move in new unique ways. You know, when
1:48
you see all the different servants of God from Old Testament to New Testament, they're doing unique things. I was reading um
1:56
like Elijah and Elisha like how God was using them to uh raise the dead even.
2:02
And there's a story of like the prophet coming on top of a person and like
2:08
putting his eyes on his and like laying on top of him. Like it just it just
2:14
sounds strange honestly. You know it just sounds strange. Strange according to what we're used to like you know it
2:21
would be more common to be like why why can't he just say arise like Jesus just said get up you know why did he have to
2:28
lay down on him the way he did you know? Um
2:34
Jesus spitting in the in the blind eyes is that that that's strange.
2:40
We see God do these new things through servants that doesn't make sense. Seems
2:46
strange. And when things are new, that's when they seem strange because it's it's rare. It's unique. It hasn't been seen
2:54
before. So, um, when you have a humble heart, you can read the word of God with
2:59
that perspective and see how God has always moved how he wants to move in an
3:05
out-ofthe- box way in a doing a new thing, not not bound to tradition and
3:12
what people are used to. Um, and and so then you can be ready to receive the new
3:18
when it comes. You can be ready to recognize this new thing that God is doing. Um so it takes that humble heart
3:28
to understand I don't know everything and even though you know if a person has
3:35
gone to Bible school has taught Bible school um has been a minister for a
3:40
really long time has had success like a massive church maybe
3:46
it really takes humility to to see God may want to confound me and God may
3:53
want to raise up someone or multiple servants of God to do a brand new thing.
3:59
Just like Jesus came to do this new thing that confounded the Pharisees, the
4:04
the religious leaders at that time, and God's will was for them to to come and
4:11
just receive this, but they they couldn't because of pride. Um,
4:17
so that's what that's what God is doing now. He's raising up new servants of God
4:23
to bring this new thing because it requires this clean slate. It, you know,
4:29
you can't be so attached to the old wine, so attached to things that, you
4:36
know, you have taught for so long. Many people can't do that. But God is is
4:42
using some like God will use some God will use some that can humble themselves just as like um Apostle Paul who used to
4:51
be Saul. So you know he used to be so a fair I mean he was a Pharisee. So God
4:57
will use some, but in terms of the the the very first ones to to carry this,
5:04
it it it has to be ones who are not so attached to the old wine, who God can
5:09
really bring the new wine in. So um yeah, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
5:20
So humility is what's needed and I praise God that he is this is the year
5:25
of acceptance and he is moving in hearts and we will see a harvest come. We will
5:31
see a harvest come. Hallelujah. We will see hearts turn. We will see Saul's become Paul's. That's going to happen.
5:38
We are going to see that. Hallelujah. And I am so excited. Hallelujah.
How to be spiritual without over spiritualizing things?
5:45
How can we be spiritual without overspiritualizing things? Um, you know, I have a message that I
5:53
taught a couple weeks ago about the importance of balance.
5:59
Um, hold on one second. I got to adjust my phone so it's good again. Okay. I
6:04
taught about the importance of balance recently. Um, so you know there's
6:10
messages like that that are important to return to to really study and get in
6:15
you. Um, and then you will have that you've have that wisdom in you to know
6:22
I better make sure I'm not overspiritualizing things. I better make sure there's a balance. So when you have
6:27
that in your heart, when you have that in your mind, when you have that in your awareness, you will be able to discern. It's when
6:34
you don't know. It's when you it's when you don't know that that could happen that you could overspiritualize things
6:41
that you can fall into deceit in that area. But when you have that awareness and you remind yourself of that, that is
6:49
wisdom in you. So day to day upon situations daytoday, you will have that
6:54
wisdom, you'll have that discernment. Um God will help you, the Holy Spirit will help you.
7:00
What to do when your friend has thoughts of death? How can you help her? Uh, well, you can share with her the
How to help a friend who is having thoughts of death?
7:07
spiritual truths you've learned about how Jesus loves her so much and that the
7:13
enemy comes to steal, kill, and destroy, but Jesus has come that that she would have abundant life and this is
7:19
oppression. If you're having thoughts of death a lot, that is oppression and she needs freedom. And so, you can share
7:25
with her how Jesus wants to free her. And if she is open to um receiving
7:30
prayer, you can command the spirit of death to leave her. You can also encourage her to watch 5F Church online
7:36
to receive the anointing in a high level over her.
7:43
Um and you can teach her about speaking life, the importance of speaking life
7:49
and rejecting the thoughts of the devil. You can share what you've learned. You can guide her to teachings where I teach
7:55
on that. I know like the power of your words is isn't is a teaching I have on
8:01
that renounce a message about renouncing like
8:09
um on my uh receive and maintain complete deliverance playlist I have messages
8:16
that would help her there. Can all attacks of the enemy be used as a refining fire by God? Yes. The Bible
Can all attacks of the enemy be used as a refining fire?
8:24
says what the enemy intended for harm, God intended for good. So, anything that
8:29
the enemy tries to bring as an attack in your life, God can use all of that for good. God wants to use all of that for
8:35
good. Um, attacks that that God will allow, he is allowing for a purpose for
8:41
it to be used for your good. So, I mean, whenever the enemy attacks, it's a test
8:47
of your faith. Immediately, your faith is tested. Um, and then your obedience
8:53
is tested as well. Will you obey God and do what he says and renew your mind with
9:00
the word of God and reject the devil's lies and confess the truth of God's word
9:06
and keep loving God, keep believing that God is faithful and he's going to help you through this and bring you victory
9:12
in this in this attack. Um and
9:18
uh keep believing that I I mean also being obedient to not complain when if
9:24
the you know in the middle of the attack. So you know you have that choice whenever an attack comes and that can
9:32
all that's that's all being tested. So when you choose to obey Jesus, when you
9:38
choose to put keep putting your faith in Jesus, when you choose to also be
9:43
humble, you know, like knowing that God knows best, like God is allowing this for your good, because that can be a
9:50
temptation sometimes when an attack comes, persecution comes, and you go through things that you didn't deserve,
9:56
like false accusations, things like this. It could be a temptation to think,
10:02
God, how could you allow this to happen? you know, that's pride. So, there's that
10:08
testing of humility as well that takes place in these times, uh, where you're
10:14
choosing to trust God and believe that he knows what he's doing. Trust him.
10:20
He's allowing this for a reason. So, trust him. Don't complain. Don't um,
10:25
question him. Question his plans. So all of that all of that you know you
10:33
all of those things you're being stretched you are having to do something
10:39
more difficult in the area of faith and obedience and humility than you did
10:44
before. That's a stretching. And so that stretching is a refining fire. That
10:50
testing is a refining fire. So absolutely everything the enemy tries to
10:56
do attack any kind of attack God wants to use as a refining fire.
11:04
And um even because there's attacks that the enemy brings that
11:10
God allows as a refining fire for you. But then there can also be attacks that
11:16
they just happen out of a repercussion. They happen because you opened a door. So it wasn't like God had this plan that
11:23
you would go through this test, but this is just a repercussion. But God can still use that, still wants to use that
11:29
for your good. Like um that that opening your eyes and seeing
11:35
and seeing this conviction can really change you. Opening your eyes and
11:41
repenting, opening your eyes to see, oh, I went wrong in this area. This is a
11:48
weakness. I need to put more attention here and not be lazy in denying my flesh
11:54
here and making the decision to follow Jesus and resist the flesh and resist
12:00
the temptation in this area. So that's how God can use even those attacks for
12:06
good as well. Is it possible to have good fruit and bad fruit? I know scripture says a good
Is it possible to have good fruit and bad fruit?
12:12
tree can't bear bad fruit, but what about a believer who is still growing spiritually but not mature yet? Yeah.
12:18
Well, the context of that passage, the context of that scripture is actually speaking about false prophets versus
12:25
true prophets. So, this is the thing. When God truly
12:30
anoints uh a a prophet, an apostle, a minister,
12:37
um when he calls them, he's going to see them like David and see a man or woman
12:44
after God's heart. And so when he calls them, there's going
12:49
to be purity there in the heart. There's there's going to be already this pure heart that God is going to be able to
12:55
mold beautifully, quickly,
13:01
perfectly, you know, and then there will be the appointed time when God releases them to
13:08
ministry, releases them to minister publicly. I mean to many to many people like
13:16
opening doors of for influence for to to lead more people and God will do that at
13:23
the right timing. Like I think about myself and I think about how um
13:29
I always loved God. I always felt different. I always felt different ever since I was
13:36
a child. Like I just had this special love for God. I I mean I just I just wanted to talk
13:42
about God more and think about God more than it felt like my friends even like Christian friends.
13:47
And I went through a lukewarm phase though, you know, I wasn't like just this like perfect angel my whole life. I
13:54
wasn't, you know, but I felt like deep down ever since I was a child, I had this different heart for God than I
14:01
noticed like my peers. And then
14:07
um I I transformed and I I sought God. I
14:12
suppose seek would seek God like never before through college years a right
14:18
after college years um when I moved to LA and and I left behind that lukewarm
14:25
life completely. And then in my mid20s is when I
14:30
surrendered everything to God. And it was nine months later that I received
14:35
the prophecy over my life. So when I surrendered to everything to God, it was
14:41
I was 25 and it was when I was baptized in the Holy Spirit. It was at the same time and the baptism of fire really
14:50
helped me so much to live pleasing to God. really it was amazing the ease at how
14:57
the fire of the Holy Spirit helped me but also my decision of true surrender
15:04
both of them together. So I just remember like
15:09
when I was just 25, even before receiving this calling over
15:15
my life, I I found that the Holy Spirit really helped me to walk to live purely
15:23
and want to please God. And so when I was called
15:29
um there wasn't this like huge transformation that had to take place in
15:35
terms of all these like sins
15:40
because it it's like my heart was really after God's when he called me
15:47
and then um and then he transformed me so much more when the anointing came
15:54
upon my life like never before and really took selfless selfishness out and
16:01
gave me a heart for his people to serve his people and
16:07
but then it was like years before even he entrusted me to lead many people.
16:15
So it was like four and a half years. So what I'm what I'm sharing with you is
16:20
like when God really calls a minister, he really makes sure they are they are a
16:29
good tree. When he calls him a man after God's heart like like David, he he didn't call just anybody. He called a
16:37
man he called he anointed David because he was after God's heart. And so when
16:42
you're after God's heart, you stay in his will. You stay in his will. But we
16:47
find David did make one mistake, huge mistake, but he completely repented. So
16:55
the the the the grace of Jesus washed over him. And this was, you know, before
17:00
the before Jesus. So things are different in the new covenant with the the the Holy Spirit's help that we have
17:07
living in us, the fire of the Holy Spirit. Um and just the the grace of
17:13
Jesus. Uh but we see just like this man after God's heart, David. He's just
17:19
continually after the father's heart day by day and it keeps him in God's will.
17:24
So um yeah, God doesn't choose just anybody. He doesn't just he chooses
17:30
someone who's after his heart when it comes to minister, a minister, a five-fold minister. So um when God
17:38
really chooses a minister, he transforms them. He he molds them and he can get them to the place where
17:43
they're not bearing any bad fruit, where they're truly only bearing good fruit,
17:49
you know, they're not having this area of like rage or something. They're not
17:54
having this area of addiction. You know, they're not having this area
17:59
where they're bearing bad fruit. So, in the context, that's really what it
18:05
means. But when we read the Bible, there's more revelation that God can be speaking upon a specific first. So like
18:11
that's the main that's the main meaning of that scripture about talking about a good tree can't bear bad fruit. But
18:19
there's also more revelation to be had like in terms of this can apply for
18:26
every believer, but it would be a little bit different. Like it can it it can apply for every believer when you're
18:32
trying to when you're discerning who to bring in close when you're noticing a
18:37
lot of good fruit in a person and not much bad fruit or any bad fruit because
18:42
they're really surrendered to God. That's how you can know it's safe to bring this person in close if that's
18:49
God's will. If if this is God's will that this person is supposed to come close in your life, you know, you're
18:54
looking for the fruit. But it's you look at a believer with fruit different than
19:00
you look at a five-fold minister. It's a different standard because when
19:07
God actually calls a minister to be there and to be responsible for the spiritual lives of people, he's taken
19:14
them through such a process, a refining fire process. He's taken them to this place where they are a good tree that
19:22
cannot bear bad fruit when it's a true anointed servant of God who's not called
19:27
by themselves but called by God. But other believers, they're in different seasons. they're in the middle of their
19:35
uh process, you know, where I mean as servants of
19:41
God, we still go through refining fire our whole lives, but there is a first a big refining fire first before God even
19:48
entrusts one to leadership. So, I mean, yeah, a a believer, they a
19:57
believer, you can see maybe a little bit of bad fruit because they're not completely transformed and changed yet.
20:02
they're on their journey. You know, that's okay. It doesn't mean, oh, they're not a good fruit. But depending,
20:08
it will teach you. I mean, you will perceive if you should bring that person in close or not.
How to know if your job is from God?
20:16
I'm blessed to have a job to sustain myself, but it is physically demanding, and I don't know if this is the will of God for me. How do I know if this is a
20:22
test from God or is not his will? Uh, really, just don't over complicate it.
20:28
um you know we it's important to have a job to be able to
20:35
uh provide for oneself. I mean to be able to pay rent and eat it's important
20:40
to have a job. So I you know before God reveals
20:47
um specific things if that sometimes God will reveal specific like you are this
20:54
is your calling like if it's ministry for example this is your calling but many times like me I had many different
21:01
jobs before I received that prophecy and not everyone will receive a prophecy not everyone is called to be a fifthful
21:06
minister it's different for everybody but what I'm saying is that be if there hasn't been this prophey prophecy or
21:12
this huge word from God that you are to work here really for getting a job. It
21:18
it it's it's quite simple. It's just it's important that you have a job so
21:24
that that that that that pays enough so that you can take care of yourself
21:29
um for your needs. Um, and then just use wisdom for a job that you have giftings
21:37
in or that you would um not be miserable in, but you could find you could have
21:42
purpose there. You could be a light to people there. Um, you know, not every
21:48
job is going to be fun, is going to be ideal, but you know, so you don't have to be looking for this perfect job, but
21:54
you can there are a lot of different jobs out there, so you can look to see um which one you would like, just like
22:01
you you you you put on uh an outfit that you like. That's okay. God God made you
22:07
in his image, gave you a personality, gave you certain giftings. So just use
22:13
like that common sense to look for a job that you would enjoy. Um maybe you wouldn't it wouldn't be like the biggest
22:20
thrill of your life. It's a job, you know, but that you could find aspects that you would enjoy that you have some
22:27
giftings in perhaps. Um and wherever you are, God can use you
22:34
because there are people and I mean many jobs there will be people you will interact with. Even if it's one person,
22:41
God can use you anywhere. So if a job is really not working out for you for whatever reason, look for another job.
22:48
But many times we don't need to overspiritualize it so much. Um,
22:53
you know, but just be wise with not quitting a job prematurely
22:59
um before having another one lined up. You know,
23:05
it's not so much of a spiritual question. Um but just walking in that
23:10
wisdom. Is it possible to see Jesus and his character in someone who is not surrendered to Christ? Yeah, that's just
Is it possible to see Jesus and His character in someone who is not surrendered to Christ?
23:17
like my answer about the good can a good tree bear h like some bad fruit if it's
23:23
so as I shared where people are in the process of being transformed. So, um,
23:29
you there can be someone who loves God, but they're not fully surrendered. And there are certain aspects that are godly
23:36
in their lives that you will see. Yes. If you have to start all over on your
If you had to start all over on your walk with Jesus, what would be the number one thing you wish you started doing sooner?
23:41
walk with Jesus, what would be the number one thing you wish you'd started doing sooner? Um, so I don't I don't think I don't
23:49
have any like regrets. I would say praise God that the Holy Spirit guided
23:54
me so faithfully every day. But I mean, if
23:59
there's something I would go back and tell my younger self,
24:05
I I I think I would tell my younger self like I think I would tell my younger
24:10
self, don't rush things. God's timing is perfect.
24:18
because there's been such a a theme on my journey of thinking the promise was
24:24
going to come sooner than it did and feeling disappointment
24:31
when it didn't. Not disappointment in God, but just you know that verse hope
24:36
deferred makes the heart sick, you know. Um, and so
24:43
I think if I could go back and tell my younger self something like you need to get this in your head and your heart.
24:53
God's timing is perfect. And you are in your mid20s. So it's
25:00
really hard to just imagine a life of decades. like
25:06
you've only lived two decades and you can't even remember more than two much
25:12
more than one of that decade, right? So to think that God has these wondrous
25:19
plans in your 20s but all in your 30s and your 40s and your 50s and your 60s and
25:27
like there's no need to rush things. There's no need to like cuz in the mind
25:33
of a 20-some year old it's like you want to get married, you want to have the
25:39
wedding, you want to ha have a house, you want to have children, you want to
25:46
have the a good job and just all these like exciting things, great things
25:54
like in that decade like of your 20s. And it's like when you're in your 20s,
26:01
you don't really think far after that. It just it feels like the really exciting things should all happen in
26:08
your 20s. And something I've learned with God is like he's just so outside of the
26:15
societal norms in that way traditions. He's
26:22
really like our whole life is beautiful. our whole life like our every age you know there's
26:30
not an expiration date where like there's an expiration date on
26:36
the best most beautiful times of your life and
26:42
the beautiful things that God wants to do it's throughout our whole life and we go
26:48
glory to glory and um I think if I could just tell my
26:54
younger self Like things are going to take time
26:59
and that's okay. Like just enjoy each season because there are precious
27:05
blessings in each season and there is so much to be grateful for right now.
27:13
You don't need this promise to happen right now. You don't need that. You
27:20
don't need that to still find such joy in Jesus and the blessings that he has
27:27
given you. Just just relax.
27:34
Just relax and don't feel that need that things have to happen fast.
27:40
I remember there were so many times where my heart would just sink and I would have tears in my I would have I
27:45
just remember vividly like being in that senior activity center. It was like a
27:51
gym space auditorium and I just remember
27:56
a lot of services, a lot of worship nights getting up there and having like
28:02
a lump in my throat and pushing past it and singing because it was so empty.
28:09
and just that feeling of disappointment. Um, but now looking back, I see like
28:18
God wanted all that to happen. Like God wanted me to persevere to God wanted me
28:24
to go through a season of a long season of a small beginning. He was
28:31
he was doing something so special in me, so powerful, molding my character through that. So if
28:39
I could tell myself, you know, you're going through something really important right now, God's going to take
28:44
you through something, it's going to be years where he's going to refine your character. He's going to be transforming
28:51
you. Like this is exciting. But in that time, you can't have these
28:58
exciting promises. This this has have to happen before the exciting promises come
29:03
to pass. But it's still so beautiful and exciting what God is doing in this. So
29:10
um just don't feel like these things have to come soon. Why? Like what's the
29:16
rush? What's the rush? Because and I think even as I'm talking now, I just really I
29:23
really think that it's a huge societal like thing that's come upon us. Like why
29:28
is there a rush? Like why do we feel like this promise must come this year?
29:33
Like why? Right? We have a lot of life to live. We had a lot have a lot of years ahead. And um even like
29:44
even like I I I've also learned to see God's beauty in going step by step. Like
29:49
I've seen God give things little by little like just a step a step
29:57
a step up a step up a step up. Um like you know uh
30:05
for example for example like I moved to a new
30:10
apartment um four years ago and it was such a step up like from where I was
30:17
before. Um it was very tiny where I was before. It wasn't in a nice neighborhood at all. There was like breakins in the
30:24
in our garage several times. My car was like broken into one time and um nothing
30:31
was stolen though. Praise God. It was just like open. Um hallelujah. Um but it
30:40
it just wasn't very it wasn't it was just very like basic, not very nice, you know, small s very simple. And then God
30:48
moved me to a different apartment that had two fireplaces. I went from not having any to two. And it was so much
30:54
nicer just like the details inside and high ceilings and like such a much nicer
31:00
area, but it wasn't like a it doesn't have it didn't have a outdoor area at
31:07
all, a patio, a backyard, nothing like that. Um, and
31:13
like it just it it wasn't like the like the perfect place. What I'm trying to say is I I look back on these things.
31:20
I'm just giving this as one example, but there's many other examples I can give in terms of steps. Um, even like even
31:27
like church like going from the park to that one building to now. Um, just the
31:33
the quality of live streams and like just the the qual the standard of
31:39
excellence at the theater we're at now, like in comparison to the the white
31:44
building where we were before. You know, I've seen just all these different aspects God move like step by step by
31:50
step. And often we're we're looking for that big promise. We're looking for like
31:56
the finish line. We're look, you know, we're looking for the big promise, but
32:02
how God takes us to the promise many times is like step by step by step. Like
32:07
we reach there by steps. And um I've noticed personally like how
32:14
it's it's actually beautiful to be in this constant like um
32:21
like not have reached the destination but still on the journey. Uh like I I I
32:27
I notice how if like if we are spoiled too early for example, you don't realize
32:34
um the blessings you have. you know, you're it's it's good to not be spoiled
32:41
because then you can really value and appreciate the blessings that God gives.
32:47
And so, it's made me it's something that you don't really understand so much until you've gone through it. Um, you
32:54
just want the the promise in its fullness right away. But I've seen this
32:59
beauty of God's way of taking taking me taking you taking us step by step by
33:06
step to just like appreciate like to value
33:12
like God you brought like if God brought like a hundred things it's like you can't even value a hundred things. If he
33:18
brings like one blessing you like really can value that one blessing. If you if
33:24
he brings like a hundred blessings it's harder to value each blessing. You see what I mean? So, so yeah, like so it's
33:32
just seeing the the the beauty of each season and just being content that you're not at the finish line yet, that
33:38
you haven't received this huge promise yet, but just be being able to see with
33:44
God's perspective how beautiful his ways are, how perfect they are. Um, so
33:51
because when you can be that way, you're not constantly feeling that like disappointment and that that that pain
33:58
of, you know, or like like even growth, like even growth like it would be just I
34:05
would feel sad when the church was like the same same just only a couple people,
34:11
only a handful of people or sometimes it went smaller and I would like I would look out and see all the empty chairs
34:17
and the huge empty space and I would feel sad. sad. Like I would feel sad, but when I look back I'm like, but it
34:24
doesn't make sense to feel sad because nothing's wrong. Like God wants this. Like God's doing this on purpose. Like
34:31
this is just what God wants now. Simple. Like you're not doing anything wrong.
34:36
It's not like the devil's winning. This is just what God wants. This is the season. This is how God wants it to be
34:42
in this season because he's refining you. He's transforming you. So
34:48
everything's good. Like why are you sad? You know what I mean? I think like if I
34:54
could go back and tell myself that like cheer up. Like you don't need to have a lump in your throat right now. Just like
35:01
be happy. God is good. God is faithful. You're blessed. And everything's good.
35:09
There's so much to be grateful for. Hallelujah. Yes. Praise God.
35:15
having business meetings to structure the business and plan how it must be run. I want to run my business God's way. I would like to have that type of
How to run your business God's ways?
35:21
meeting with God to ensure what I do is his way and not my way. Um, you know, just what I shared this past Sunday
35:29
about how God gives you what he's given you. He's giving you gifts. He's giving you finances. He's giving you bis a
35:36
business. He's giving you these things for his kingdom. So just just
35:42
remembering that and renewing your mind with that whenever you do anything whenever you do anything
35:48
with the business just renewing your mind of that knowing you know because in the world's way it's about oneself it's
35:55
about like selfish ambition
36:00
that's like the motive behind the business your personal success you you making
36:07
money, you know, and it's not that we forget about making money, but it's making
36:13
money for God's kingdom. Like that's like that's the real and and and and we
36:19
get to be be blessed by it, too. We This is, you know, God uses that to provide
36:25
for yourself, too. But rather than the focus, the motive of everything you're
36:30
doing with business being about your gain, it being about God's gain, it
36:37
being about God's kingdom. So just simply keeping that in your heart, renewing your mind with that, inviting
36:43
God in to your business, your business plans, meetings,
36:48
then the Holy Spirit will guide you in wisdom.
How to overcome feeling like you share too many details while sharing your personal testimony?
36:53
How to overcome feeling like you share too many details during your personal testimony sharing? Um, I mean,
37:02
when you are sharing honestly your testimony, it's helping people and you're overcoming the devil by that.
37:07
When you're sharing honestly your testimony, it is helping people. Simple. Now, there's
37:14
a wise way to share testimonies, as I've shared in the past, like um I mean, you
37:20
should be sharing with wisdom. Like for example, you know, if someone had abused you, you
37:28
should share the story with wisdom. Like for example, you can say like a person
37:34
in my past abused me rather than saying like the person's name or describing the
37:40
person in detail. And above all, not like trashing the person, but you know,
37:45
speaking the testimony out of a heart of forgiveness and grace.
37:50
um just like simply sharing like this is a part of my story, not trying to make someone like look bad, you know? So
38:00
that's the wise way to share testimony. But above all else, you don't need to think so critically about the sharing of
38:09
your testimony. you know, like um if you feel like you shared too many details in
38:17
some way you don't need to feel like this is like a big sin, you know, like
38:24
just God's grace is covering you. So just ask God for his grace. If you think
38:30
that there was that it was something you revealed was not good or something, ask
38:35
for his grace. But your testimony overcomes the devil. So whenever you
38:41
face attacks concerning your testimony like in your mind like guilt for
38:47
example, condemnation, you need to remember that it's the enemy. The enemy is angry about what? About you sharing
38:54
your testimony. There's so much power in your testimony. This is how we overcome the devil. They overcame by the blood of
39:01
the lamb and the word of their testimony. There's so much power in your testimony. So if you ever find attacks
39:08
concerning your testimony, know what's going on. Know the enemy is angry. So
39:14
you have the victory. You've overcome the devil already with your testimony. Don't let the devil discourage you. Uh
39:23
we should be joyful to share our testimony and just so joyful knowing that lives are saved, healed, delivered,
39:29
transformed, brought closer to Jesus because we have testified. So like always sharing your testimony should be
39:36
such such a joyous thing. Never let the devil steal that. So I speak peace to
39:42
you and all of the condemnation and negative thoughts go in Jesus' name.
How to gain wisdom?
39:50
Did Prophet Jordi impart his wisdom to you as well? Can your wisdom be
39:55
imparted? You've always sounded so wise even in the park. Glory to God. Glory to
40:00
God. Um well yeah yes yes absolutely well first
40:07
of all when you are called to be a five-fold minister
40:12
God releases the anointing upon you but also really helps you to understand the
40:18
spiritual realm for based on your calling like because as a fifold
40:23
minister especially apostles they do so much teaching and prophets but apostles so much they do so much
40:29
teaching that's a part of their calling. So they they they they have the grace to
40:38
understand the word of God, understand the kingdom of God, the spiritual realm
40:43
and teach it in a way that the believers can understand. They have that special
40:50
grace. So part of is part of it is the grace that comes with the calling that
40:55
comes with the office. Um, and you know, Peter, he was given
41:03
the keys of the kingdom. And before he was given the keys of the kingdom,
41:09
Jesus gave a test to all the disciples. He says, "Who do you say I am?" And some
41:15
disciples were saying other an like answers like like a like a like a like a
41:21
prophet, like a teacher. But only Peter said, "You're the Messiah." So his
41:28
spiritual eyes could see more in depth of who Jesus was. And Jesus immediately
41:34
says it was not it was it was it was not flesh that revealed this to you. Like
41:41
this was only revealed to you by the spirit of God. And we learn through the Bible how can God reveal things to us?
41:50
How can our spiritual eyes open up when you are humble?
41:55
When you are pure, the pure in heart shall see God. The pure in heart, their spiritual eyes open and they see and
42:02
they understand the spiritual realm. And also when the disciples first came
42:09
back from casting out demons for the first time, Jesus says he he praises the father and he says,
42:16
"I praise you father for hiding these things from those who are wise and proud and only revealing it to the humble and
42:22
childlike." So this is very clear in the word of God that for your spiritual eyes
42:28
to open up and to see in the spiritual realm to have wisdom
42:33
because you you see in the spiritual realm you understand the spiritual realm. You understand the things of God.
42:39
You have to be humble and pure. There's no other way. There's no other way because it's the spirit of God that
42:46
reveals these things to you. But the spirit of God only reveals these things when you choose to be humble and pure.
42:54
So um when my spiritual father like teaches me and equips me and shares
43:01
things with me prophetically, I have to be humble
43:07
to receive and humble so that I have to
43:12
be humble so that also God can increase my understanding.
43:18
So, like if he teaches me something, I I don't just if you're not humble,
43:23
you'll just be like, "What? This doesn't make sense. I don't get it." Like deeper things of the spiritual realm
43:29
or I haven't heard this before. What? I don't get that. And you just like throw it away. You don't value it. But when
43:35
you're humble and your spiritual parent, your spiritual leader teaches you
43:42
something, you value it. You You take it as God's word. even if you don't
43:48
understand it right away. And that releases the grace upon you for
43:54
the spirit of God to open your eyes more. It it releases when you are pure and
44:01
humble and you can receive a word as God's word coming from a true anointed servant of God,
44:08
the grace of God comes upon you to open your eyes more, to bring you more understanding.
44:14
So, glory to God. There's so many times when my spiritual father
44:21
will will share something will will share something with me even like will share something and I will
44:27
even teach it that Sunday many times like but he will share something small
44:35
like only for a few minutes like he'll share something
44:41
but then the Holy Spirit will quicken me will give me more revelation will will
44:49
expand that expand that word and give me more
44:55
revelation more revelation of how to to teach this
45:02
principle this subject in the kingdom.
45:07
Glory to God. Thank you Jesus. Praise God. Well, I am
45:13
so thankful to Jesus for all he has done today. I want to pray over all of you. I
45:18

46:18
to bring condemnation, any way the enemy has tried to stifle

46:56

47:04
restlessness, impatience would go
47:09
and that your your your your perspective would grow in God's God's perspective
47:15
would grow in you so that you can see far ahead
47:22
not just the present thinking, wanting things must happen
47:30
right away, but that you would see with God's perspective. You would see far
47:36
and you would have patience and peace and rest and contentment with Jesus and
47:44
his perfect plans in Jesus name. May your spiritual eyes open up to see the beauty more. The beauty of life, the
47:51
beauty of God's blessings, the beauty of relationship with Jesus.
47:56
May your eyes see the beauty more now in Jesus name.
48:02
Amen. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. And I also want to declare if anyone needs healing
48:07
or freedom, I release this anointing upon you. May these miracles take place in your life now
48:14
in Jesus name. receive this miracle, receive healing, receive freedom, receive breakthrough in Jesus' name.
