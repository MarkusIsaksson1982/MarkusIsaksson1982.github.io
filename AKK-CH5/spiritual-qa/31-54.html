if we sense that somebody wants approval from us should we give it to
0:09
them uh well well let's let's let's start with
0:17
this we should seek to have the approval of God that's where we should really
0:24
seeking our be seeking our approval we we we should be seeking approval I mean God approves of us us as his children no
0:32
matter what we do so we don't have to seek for that we just have to come to Jesus like come to faith in him and we
0:38
receive that uh but Al but like God doesn't approve of all the actions of
0:46
his children so we should seek to please him we should seek to make him
0:53
approved and and happy with how we live our lives so in that area it is good to
0:59
seek approval for him I mean seek approval in our actions and our you know there's a there's a scripture in the
1:05
Psalms let the words of my mouth the meditations of my heart be pleasing to
1:12
you Lord so that's a Psalm seeking approval from God of your meditations
1:18
and of your like what you're thinking about what you're putting what you're putting your mind to and your
1:24
actions um so you know we should be being after God's heart is wanting to
1:30
please him wanting him to be approved with with how we live and so you know um
1:40
even to to have a spiritual uh father or mother to to to desire them to be proud
1:47
of you and even your your parents to be proud of you that's not a bad thing
1:53
that's a that's a beautiful thing you know when you know you can trust for example spiritual father or mother
2:00
and you know you want them to be proud of you you want to be God you want God to be proud of you and you want them to be proud of you that's a beautiful and
2:07
good thing too um but we have to make sure that we're looking to we're looking
2:13
for God's approval among above everything else and so this question asks if if someone is I can tell that
2:21
they want me to be approved of them uh or they want me to approve of them
2:27
they're seeking approval well if someone's like trying to be
2:33
manipulative in that way then you shouldn't be manipulated you shouldn't allow yourself to be manipulated but if
2:39
you can see that someone's insecure maybe and they want your approval but
2:45
maybe maybe though they might have areas of growth in the in the in the way that
2:51
they are the fact that they are insecure but maybe they are doing good
2:57
things when you can sense some someone needs encouragement when you can sense someone is wanting to be doing good
3:06
maybe doing good in the Lord like doing good things for God you know if that's
3:11
their heart and maybe they look up to you for example um you know as as
3:17
someone more mature in Christ to to spot that this person could
3:23
be blessed by encouragement this could be a way that God's showing love to them
3:28
this could be a way that they will be edified by encouraging them
3:34
that's that's important when we should encourage people as Holy Spirit leads so
3:40
sometimes it will be just like holy spirit putting it on your heart encourage them bless them with this and
3:46
we all need it I mean we all need to be built up it it will always help us to be
3:53
built up to be encouraged because we're all in a spiritual war so it's always is
3:59
going to become helpful but then there can be sometimes where you're seeing
4:05
someone man they really really need encouragement like this will really bless them help them be really a way
4:13
that God will show his love to them and so you would M you should make more of
4:18
an intention to encourage that person in that case so to so long story short to
4:24
summarize answering that question just it just depends on the situation don't don't allow yourself to
4:31
be manipulated but if someone's insecure they need more of God's love and they
4:38
are doing good things encourage them in what they're doing good in
4:46
amen whenever you've been persecuted it's always been on my heart to stand up and defend you I don't want to engage in
4:53
judgmental critical debates like I may have done before 5f can you expand on how to best respond
5:01
and defend without letting in a spirit of
5:07
offense yes and
5:13
so a lot of people that are
5:18
speaking against the work of God a servant of God a lot of people are Pharisees that
5:24
are doing this and the thing that we learn about the Pharisees is that they don't
5:30
listen that they're not earnestly coming to hear the truth learn they're not
5:37
coming like I'm confused this is different can
5:44
you explain so I can learn like is this true is this false I
5:50
don't know they are not coming that way at all I mean we see the story of the
5:55
the the man who was blind since birth and um the Pharisees are like he's a sinner who
6:03
healed you uh and and he's like I don't know if he's a sinner or not all I know
6:09
is once as I was blind and now I am healed now I can see and so he's
6:15
basically saying this man whatever he is you know like
6:22
whatever you want to what he blessed me you blessed my life like never before
6:27
this Jesus so I don't know what you I don't know what you want me to tell
6:34
you and they really they didn't want to hear it they they didn't want to receive
6:40
and hear the fruits that he was just simply showing them giving them this is
6:46
what I know and really that's fruits that's fruits for for those of us for
6:51
for for any believer if they're wanting to know if they're thinking this might be false is this false is this true what
6:59
you should be looking for is the fruits so that was valuable for them if someone
7:04
had an open childlike heart humble heart they would see oh this is the answer to
7:10
our question we were wondering if this was true or false now we receive this news this testimony this is fruit that
7:18
it is God so okay we have our answer
7:23
now but um that's not how it went at all you know so this is how most people are that
7:31
speak against the work of God today so for the most part it's going to be
7:39
really a waste of time and draining to be
7:45
responding to these types of Pharisees but there will be sometimes a
7:51
holy spirit will lead you to respond where it is
7:56
necessary um it's kind of like for the most most part there's no need to engage
8:03
because they they do not want to listen um and it it won't do much good
8:12
but there could be times when for example like if there are many PE if
8:19
there are people around whether this is like social media or whether this is in real
8:25
life if there are people around who are listening who are
8:31
hearing um this Pharisees speak bad things and you can discern these people
8:38
aren't Pharisees that are listening these are just people these are just people that I don't know you know what
8:45
they know and so you you can see now this can be so dangerous this could literally lead someone astray by just
8:53
the Pharisees voice coming out so the thing with defending the thing with
8:59
defending the gospel defending the truth not denying the truth that set you free it's important to walk in that
9:06
wisdom of of of of of of like defending the
9:12
faith when it's important speaking up when you know that there will be serious damage if you
9:18
don't there that there could be serious damage for people listening that there
9:24
wouldn't be just one voice one negative voice speaking out
9:30
there so um you know here's a little example of like on my on my pages if
9:37
people write bad comments on my things for the most part I'm um not responding
9:43
to them for the most part I'm seeing like these people they just say well like you're false or something like
9:48
they're they're not coming with a a heart to want to hear um now sometimes
9:54
there are some times where if I have time because I it's not my main calling to be
10:00
uh responding to questions like this on my social media but if people want to
10:05
learn they can listen to teachings they can devote time to listen and you'll get the answers there amen so it's not my
10:12
main calling to when somebody just sees one little video quick video or
10:18
something and they take things out of context and then they're asking questions that's not my main calling to
10:24
respond to give them an answer but there can be sometimes when I say oh I can see
10:32
that this person if I just quickly respond this could help bring clarification to this person and this
10:39
person's not completely like just like a Pharisee you know just saying you're false
10:45
and not not here to listen at all kind of thing so I give that example to give
10:51
it to share with you how it's going to be like most times it's not going to be the best use
10:58
of time uh uh to be responding responding responding defending
11:03
defending defending but so walk in that wisdom this is the moment I need to
11:10
speak up this is the moment that if I don't speak up people won't
11:16
know the truth people can be misled okay so what I'm saying that can apply to both social media and in person
11:26
I mean in publicly you know um
11:31
you know we've had I I've seen this happen at um my revivalist now events
11:37
like people just people as Pharisees just go there on a mission to
11:43
um to lead people astray and just go there
11:49
just saying she's false because women can't preach you know she's false
11:55
because she's not ministering the exact way I think she should be minister you know like reciting the sinner's prayer
12:02
and saying the words repent repent repent or you're going to hell like things like this I've seen people um
12:08
even like come to my events on that mission to lead people
12:13
astray and to speak these things loudly to people so there are these people that are
12:20
hearing these things if you are there and see that that may be a moment to
12:25
make sure you speak up and not get in a long heated debate but make sure that
12:32
it's not only the the negative voice the the voice of the enemy
12:40
speaking amen so that let our Voice of Truth be louder than the voice of the
12:46
enemy because the enemy is barking the enemy is constantly barking he's constantly barking through people like
12:53
constantly saying false false don't go here don't go and Steve here because
13:00
it's not true and bl speaking all these lies he's constantly barking and so it's
13:07
important that we don't keep silent that we let our testimonies be louder that we
13:13
let our Praises be louder and that in situations like what I just described if
13:19
you happen to be I mean I don't know it could just this could happen
13:24
sometimes in like a public space maybe people are waiting in a line for a Revival event or something and somebody
13:31
comes on a mission to just start speaking bad things to people coming in line to come and receive you know first
13:40
of all you should share that with leadership so that the the ushers and security who are trained can deal with
13:46
the situation but in the meantime if like before they come or something speak
13:52
the truth you know don't just sit there silently and just let the Pharisees be
13:57
the only voice speaking amen um and so also it's going
14:03
to depend on one's growth level like you shouldn't be ashamed if you're not
14:11
completely super mature spiritually yet you know what I mean like the more that
14:16
we the more years we have in Christ the more mature we will be and strong we will be so we can stare at the face the
14:24
of of the devil through a Pharisee you know and it won't drain us and we will
14:29
be will stand strong and will know what to say will know the truth to speak um
14:36
and and and and you know it won't hurt us but if you
14:42
are earlier on in your journey you know you're not quite called to go on that like Frontline position
14:49
type thing is what I'm trying to say you don't have to feel like ashamed or something that you're not doing enough
14:56
like when it comes to um confronting a Pharisee speaking up um
15:05
what your job is really to testify your job is to stay in your own space on your own platform and be loud for Jesus and
15:11
testify and testify and testify you don't have to worry about like going in the enemies camp and going into that
15:18
like spiritually more dangerous situation you know you don't need to
15:25
feel um ashamed now as I shared on Sunday when I spoke about how it's
15:31
important we don't deny the truth that has set us free the the the big mean the big
15:38
meaning of that message is really make sure that you are speaking up enough
15:44
make sure you are testifying enough make sure you are not not you are not keeping
15:51
silent with your testimony because of fear of persecution because of fear of
15:57
enemies that's really the big importance is that in your own life in your own
16:02
platform that you are not being quiet um it doesn't mean that you have
16:08
to respond and and like defend every time a a Pharisee or enemy speaks
16:16
against um the work of God or your leader like
16:22
on your page or whatever there can be times when you know you you feel called by God to defend to speak up to confront
16:30
but the the biggest thing is that you would use your own platform social media and in and in life
16:38
in your I mean in the physical life to speak up speak the truth you know these
16:46
Pharisees are these these enemies of God are devoting it's crazy like like for me
16:53
this is for every servant of God this is for every servant of God um
17:00
that that is truly walking in the anointing they will constantly have
17:06
people making videos up up about them I mean and and I and I I notice this more now that um I see this happen to me I I
17:15
wasn't so much you know in the YouTube world of seeing other ministers being
17:20
attacked or anything before but now I'm being put in videos with the many other
17:26
ministers and stuff like this of people attacking you know so I see like every
17:32
Minister who is who is uh a leader who
17:37
has a big church every single one who's powerful
17:42
in God who is carrying anointing who is pioneering who is offending the
17:48
religious spirit I mean I see some people that I've not really seen Miracles through them power of God
17:54
through them but I'm seeing them go against the religious spirit so God uses people in different ways you know like
18:01
God uses he can use he can use people where they're at even if they don't have
18:06
revelation of the power of God but maybe they have Revelation about the the the
18:13
religious spirit and um how that's the old wine you know and so so I just see
18:19
all these ministers constantly being having videos being made exposed videos
18:24
about them so um you know I see this for me
18:30
it's like it's like almost every day I don't watch the videos I don't watch the
18:36
videos but I see almost every day I will see um someone else is making a video
18:41
about me an exposed an exposed video speaking against me um but you know why
18:48
I say that to you right now I say that to to share with you
18:53
how how passionate and hardworking
18:59
the Pharisees are how passionate and
19:06
hardworking and zealous the Pharisees
19:12
are and Innovative Now
19:18
using being creative knowing what will be clickbait they're they're literally
19:25
being creative and knowing what will be clickbait to gain
19:32
views so they're working hard they are
19:37
passionate the this is the devil and this is the devil encouraging them and they're doing
19:43
it I think that's very humbling and sobering for
19:49
us that we should never let the passion and hard work creativity
19:57
innovativeness of the Pharisees of the enemies be
20:03
greater than ours be greater than our hard work for Jesus be greater than our
20:10
passion for the work of Jesus the immense hate and public hate
20:16
and videos made against Servants of God against the work of God that should not
20:21
it should not be that there's millions of hate videos but zero good videos Tes
20:28
find this is the work of God
20:34
Amen so um I I'm speaking of our own our own
20:40
personal platforms that's the area we God is calling everyone to step up in is
20:47
to being loud and proud of Jesus and not I mean we have to we have the
20:54
choice that that that that God would win that that the enemy would would not
20:59
win we have the choice we have to say yes to God and be a vessel of him and
21:05
let him use us to make the praise and testimony of Jesus be louder be greater
21:11
than the voice of the enemies amen and that's another reason
21:19
why it's going back to what I've shared about um the prophetic word I shared in
21:27
October it's not okay for people
21:34
with big platforms Christian leaders to be quiet
21:40
it's a problem because you see you have these heresy Hunter um super
21:47
demonic I mean nothing but pure demonic YouTube channels I mean they devote them
21:53
their whole they devote their whole Ministry to tearing down
22:02
people to speaking against Servants of
22:07
God and they have huge followings a lot of them have huge
22:13
followings it's sad because I mean there's a the reason why is because
22:18
there's people out there that have hatred in their hearts that have jealousy and um they want to
22:26
see Servants of God be taken down so they're so evilish happy to to
22:37
see someone making these videos that's why they have these
22:43
followings so um that's why it's so um serious so
22:50
serious that prophetic word I shared very very serious you know that
22:57
you you you have Fair with huge platforms speaking and speaking against
23:03
Servants of God and then you have people of God with huge
23:08
platforms not being quiet for fear of
23:14
attacks on them persecution so by doing that they
23:21
are they are allowing the the Servants of God just to be fried by the Pharisees
23:29
and the voice of the the enemy to be louder when they know it's it's the
23:34
truth so that's why I shared back in October it's very serious this is this
23:40
is not a joke this is not a joke God is means serious business because this is
23:45
his work he's chosen to use his vessels he's chosen to use his vessels
23:54
to be that loud that voice that says this is God testify so that people aren't confused
24:01
that people aren't let astray by the Pharisee voices so the word remains and God is
24:09
still asking his people he's still asking his leaders to do
24:14
this to speak up for him to speak up for his work the second part of that
24:19
question how do I not let a fence in my heart um and
24:26
so that has partly to with like if you're finding if you're putting your
24:31
eyes so much on the defending and you're
24:36
finding that offense it might be an indicator that it's not really your calling to go so much in that
24:43
area right now at least it's more God's calling you instead to really focus on
24:50
testifying on your own platform in your own life uh uh and staying focused uh uh
24:57
and and and protect your peace because when we focus too much
25:03
on like defending with the Pharisees it can bring um it can it can it can lead
25:11
to distraction and take our peace away so that's why it just depends on one's own spiritual journey where they're at
25:17
and what specifically God's calling to them calling them to in that moment and Case by case uh but how do you not let offense
25:25
in your heart um I share this this this is one of the biggest things that really helps me whenever I hear Pharisees when
25:32
I hear Pharisees speak against the work of God speak against me speak against uh
25:37
deliverance and women preaching and leading uh and um just all the different
25:44
things that they speak against it's really if you do if you ever hear it or you read a comment it is hard it is hard
25:51
to hear like it's just grieving um it's sad it's frustrating
25:59
but what's helped me the most to not be shaken to not be distracted like when I happen to see that comment or hear
26:05
something the Pharisees saying is remembering renewing my mind with this first that the things of the spirit are
26:13
foolish to the carnal man and remembering about the Pharisees
26:19
how there like Jesus says I can speak this but you won't hear you have ears
26:25
but you can't hear so I can preach to you but you will still not here and so
26:30
it's just that simple truth that simple reality that this is just how things are
26:35
that there will be these people who call Jesus his work his servants the
26:44
fruits of the spirit foolish they just will they will see it as foolish they
26:51
will call it foolish that's just how it's going to be I can't change that there's nothing I can do to change that
26:57
there's nothing nothing that anybody can do to change it because God gives us free will God gives us free will whether
27:04
we will humble ourselves so that he can open our eyes and see the spiritual truth or not and so it's something we can't
27:12
change it's something that will be there and it's just life like it's just life and at the same
27:19
time it's not going to hinder what God wants to do through our lives it's not going to stop the work of God as long as
27:26
we keep doing what God has called us to do we keep testifying we keep going strong it will not hinder what God wants
27:34
to do it can feel like a temporarily for sure I mean they do they do damage but
27:40
it's not a Victorious work that they do uh you know they they do damage
27:46
temporarily but God comes with vengeance con comes with Vindication God comes to
27:52
prove himself God makes sure that that whatever the enemy steals it's turned
27:58
and more to you so like so like it's coming like
28:04
even even the the the this revival all that the enemy has done to attack this
28:11
revival all the damage he has done that have led people
28:17
astray there is a day coming where he's got to pay I mean there's a day coming
28:24
where God has accounted for all the damage he has has done all the damage he
28:29
has caused all the hurt he has caused all the hurt he's caused Servants of God all
28:35
the hurt he's called Revival Warriors in the Kingdom of God in his Revival he remembers it all and
28:44
so blessings are coming and in increase more blessings than the damage
28:52
caused and in terms of the work of God like in the Revival that God's doing that as as God is coming in this revival
28:59
to bring Salvation and healing and freedom and impartation and and spiritual food opening up eyes of the
29:06
people of God so in all those areas that the devil stopped that I mean like that
29:11
he stopped some people from receiving because we all have free will the work of God has always gone forth It's just sometimes there's not as many people who
29:18
are receiving because people have free will so the ways of the enemy has come spoken lies and people in their own free
29:23
will decided to listen to the lies that damage that that was
29:29
cused there's a day coming where the devil's going to pay have to pay and God
29:36
is going to show himself so powerful God is going to open up doors God is going
29:44
to come in signs and wonders and shock the world he's going to prove himself
29:51
through his move this revival through his servants he's going to prove himself
29:56
an even an even even bigger way than he so far
30:03
has that all of that area of where where people weren't saved weren't healed
30:08
weren't freed weren't receiving because of the the damage the devil caused now so many
30:16
more are receiving healing Freedom salvation spiritual food to equip them
30:21
open their eyes they will be receiving that so many more will be receiving that
30:27
than those that were lost I mean the dam those that weren't receiving because of
30:33
what the devil did you know I mean think about the time
30:39
of Jesus in the gospels think about his
30:44
ministry his ministry just think about like so many people came to Jesus but
30:50
then but then the devil would come and and in their minds would speak you know
30:55
when Jesus spoke about the message you need to eat my and drink my blood he spoke that message and it offended so
31:01
many people the enemy would have spoken their heads and said hey what these Pharisees said I think they're right
31:06
this is this is heresy this is not aligning with the word of
31:15
God and remember he healed on the Sabbath and the leaders of the the the
31:22
the people of God of today all of pretty much all of them are against Jesus so now I hear hear this word that Jesus is
31:29
speaking this is confirmation to what I've been hearing okay I'm out I'm
31:35
leaving okay so like that's an example of damage that the devil caused at the
31:41
time of Jesus's Ministry so Jesus his ministry was I mean the people he
31:48
reached when he was on Earth is small because of the works of the
31:54
devil compared to the The Works of Jesus
32:00
post his resurrection
32:06
like there was just you know some thousands a few thousands or so a few
32:13
thousands or so came to belief in him when he was on this Earth and a lot of them were lost
32:20
because of what the enemy did but then after he was resurrected through the ministry of the
32:25
Apostles 3,000 came to Jesus in just one day that's like that's payback you see
32:31
like that's like one day on the day of Pentecost one day 3,000 came that would
32:38
have been like more than than what would have been done in a day I I believe in the time of Jesus in
32:46
just one day you know so that's just an example now now now the gospel spread
32:51
across the entire world and the gospel spread across the whole world in quite a short amount of time after the the time
32:58
of Jesus in quite a short amount of time it spread across the world so you see
33:06
how God did so much greater than the the
33:12
the damage the enemy caused so that really encourages me whenever I
33:20
see damage that the devil does temporarily whenever I see persecution
33:25
really encourages me because I know that there's coming a day there's coming a day where the devil has to pay where you
33:35
know he can't get away with that damage he can't get away with anything that he
33:41
does he cannot get away with it so there's coming a day Hallelujah let that
33:48
encourage you let you let it not discourage you the devil's never never winning but um in the moment we have to
33:56
do all we can in that moment in the moment where the devil's voice is so loud we have to do all we can to let God
34:05
use us and be a voice for him and be a voice of the truth and cut down on as
34:11
much damage as as possible damage of the devil that that where he's trying to
34:16
lead people astray as possible do their attacks discourage you how do you deal
34:21
with it etern internally we're human we're hum so
34:28
there's no way that attacks like that won't
34:33
hurt it's absolutely painful it's definitely part of the cost it's part of
34:38
the cost of the anointing because when I never went through that before I H I
34:44
said yes to God to carrying the anointing I never went through attacks like that hatred false
34:53
accusations speak things made up about me and speaking with so much hatred and the things that people say about me or
34:59
sh you want to believe the things I mean I delete a lot that I see in my page so
35:04
it's really bad like it's really bad like people um saying that they can't
35:10
wait for me to go to hell and they they want all these bad things that happen to me I mean
35:16
just it's bad the things that people
35:21
say but um if you if you are not surrendered to
35:27
Jesus and love him with all your heart you can never make it you would quit you
35:33
would become bitter depressed angry and very distracted just give up absolutely
35:41
it's only my surrender to Jesus and my love for Jesus and his people that keep me
35:49
strong and so you know God's really spoken to spoken to me about this through his
35:54
word we will have persecution the greater the anointing the greater
36:00
the persecution and Jesus was treated as the worst kind of criminal and the worst
36:07
kind of hate was shown to him and he says that your the servant is no greater
36:13
than the master so you should be expected to be P hated and persecuted too so meaning like I'm not greater than
36:21
Jesus I'm not greater than my master so I don't get to get to pass by without
36:28
persecution without hatred so God's really just spoken to me
36:35
you know this is part of it it's part of it it's part of your
36:40
surrender it's part of picking up your cross and the more that it comes you
36:46
know it's it's actually an encouragement it's the more anointing that you are carrying the the greater things that
36:53
you're doing for me the more people that are being reached and like Liv changed
36:58
and I have seen that shift I have definitely seen that correlation I have definitely seen the hatred increase as
37:06
the anointing has increased as the size of the ministry has increased as doors have opened I have seen a definite
37:13
correlation with the hatred and the persecution even measures we've had to take for just with wisdom in terms of
37:20
like security and things like this my life is totally different without giving you um details my personal life looks
37:30
completely different um than a year
37:36
ago because of how that persecution hatred has increased in terms of
37:42
just per personal personally for my own security my own like life it my life is
37:49
lived completely different and it would really surprise people I think to see how I have to live with wisdom because
37:55
of the intense hatred that's shown and and and and and the the intense hatred that people have for
38:02
me and just just evil you know um in in people's hearts so
38:09
um I've seen that correlation things have had to change um and so I I see
38:17
like this is this is not a this is not a bad thing this is a sign that we are
38:22
going higher for Jesus this is a sign that he is making this revival go higher
38:28
and higher and higher for his glory and so I always renew my mind to see the spiritual truth I always renew my
38:35
spiritual mind to see this is this is a part of it and this is good and this is nothing to get
38:41
distracted over and this is all worth it for for God's people to be saved and
38:47
healed delivered and know his love it is worth it it is a small price to pay I
38:52
mean it is a big price but like when you really can see I mean the cost you know is Big it's a big cost in terms of like
38:59
it hurts and it's uncomfortable and there's such a sacrifice you have to make but when you really
39:05
see the the lives changed and healed and delivered and what God can do through
39:11
you if you can say yes and carry his anointing then this sacrifice this cost
39:17
of the hatred the persecution all of that is small it's small and I renew my
39:24
mind to that I renew my mind to that I have to to keep my eyes on the good I have to keep my eyes
39:32
focused on what God's called me to do and I I humble myself and renew my mind
39:38
you know that it's Disobedience to God to focus on the bad to be distracted to
39:46
dwell on the bad to feel sorry for myself
39:51
um it's Disobedience so I don't even let myself think about it too much dwell on
39:58
it too much I make the spiritual discipline to
40:04
continually set my eyes on things above on Jesus and stay focused with the
40:10
work is it out of spiritual order for people to seek spiritual counsel from
40:15
outside of where they're planted well where you are planted that's where God has called you to be receiving from and
40:22
that includes spiritual counsel Direction um where you are planted
40:28
is like where God says I want you to be planted here it's because this Vision
40:35
here of of this ministry for example God wants you to be a part of and so the
40:42
leadership there is equipped to help one spiritually there
40:49
specifically for their purpose in life it's like um God knows his people's
40:55
purpose his the their callings and what they need and so when God says I want
41:01
this person planted here he's he's equipped that leader to
41:06
release and this can be many times just through a message or through a live like this not even just oneon-one but he's
41:14
equipped the leader to release what they need and this is something very
41:19
sensitive when it comes to the new wine and the Revival because there's so many
41:24
there's a lot of people that are still I mean have good Hearts maybe they even have big platforms but they don't have
41:32
the revelation of the new wine completely there's still religion
41:37
there and so they're lacking the spiritual maturity wisdom needed to help
41:45
a person that God's called to be planted where there is the new wine and
41:53
the the spiritual maturity and wisdom so that can be a problem when you go
41:59
outside like where God hasn't called you to be receiving from and um they're just
42:06
not equipped for that that person nothing wrong with the person but like with a different leader or something but
42:12
that person specifically isn't anointed to handle and help you with
42:20
your spiritual life and uh uh obstacles and and questions and everything thing
42:28
where when you're called at a certain place I you know like for example at F church I hear so many people say so many
42:33
times I hear people testify like every Sunday and every live like this and
42:39
every like every message it's like literally a question they had or something they were wondering about
42:45
something they needed an answer to and it was answered through the message it was answered through the live and I've
42:51
heard a lot of these testimonies of people being so shocked because it's not just one time but it's like every single week
42:57
and that just testifies of the prophetic anointing and The Importance of Being planted where God has actually called
43:03
you to be planted and how he he's so wise I mean God God knows I know my
43:10
people have this question I know my people need to have this answer I know they need direction in this area so I'm
43:15
going to release it through in my order through the leadership through the message
43:22
um this is that P that leader is you know anointed for this
43:28
can hear my voice has the prophetic anointing you know um so they can be a
43:34
vessel and release this word sometimes I hear a small voice like no when I do certain things is this of
43:40
the devil or God speaking so the the biggest way that God's voice is going to
43:46
be speaking is through his word and through the written word and the spoken word so through the teachings where you
43:54
are planted the teachings revealing how God speaks the teachings revealing of
44:00
how to live a life pleasing to God uh so when you are living your daily
44:08
life making decisions you should be making them with
44:15
the wisdom you've received from the word of God like with the knowledge you've
44:21
received the Revelation knowledge you've received from the word of God the written word of God and the spoken word of God that that that has taught you
44:27
this is how to live this is what would be pleasing to God we are made in God's image and he's called us to um not be
44:35
robots but to have our own free will and also to um be creative and to make our
44:41
own decisions within God's will um but for example like we can
44:48
choose what we want to wear you know we don't have to say be like a robot and be like God what do I wear today like we
44:55
can as long as as it's um you know modest and doesn't have uh demonic
45:02
images or writings on them God wants us to use our mind and that he's given us
45:09
and make decisions and choose what we'd like to wear you know of course there can be sometimes God is speaking
45:15
something very specifically I want you to wear this color because of this prophetic meaning and that's different
45:20
but I'm just saying like on a day-to-day basis same for food eat F food that
45:26
nourishes your body but you don't have to say God um should I have um salmon or
45:32
steak today you know so in your life there's going to be so many different
45:39
decisions you're making and um it's needs to be based on
45:44
the word of God you've received uh and that's how God's going to be speaking so if if if you're going
45:51
to grab the salmon to eat and you hear a voice that says no things like that
45:57
that that is most likely not the voice of God that is most likely just the
46:05
enemy trying to bring confusion and trying to come with these just like
46:10
voices trying to play God and just bring distraction and confusion God usually
46:15
comes in a still Small Voice um which is not going to be like a loud yes no it'll be usually in a still
46:24
for the most part in in a still Small Voice and so if you're sensing if it's
46:31
things like this you know like between a a a a blue shirt or a green shirt and
46:37
you go to grab the blue shirt and you hear a voice that says no that's probably not
46:42
God if you're choosing between um going to spend your
46:50
day to rest and be with God and relax choosing to go to the ocean or the the a
46:57
hike and you go decide to go to the ocean and you say and you hear no that's
47:02
you probably not God but it's not saying always I mean there can be sometimes
47:08
when Holy Spirit specifically wants you to go somewhere for a specific purpose or maybe there's danger in a certain
47:14
area so he's leading you to go a different way sometimes we're delayed in things um that we don't understand why
47:21
so I don't mean every single time but I'm just I'm just sharing generally when
47:26
when it comes to daytoday you're going about your life making decisions for the most part God will not
47:34
be speaking in this this abrupt like no way now um if it's if it's between doing
47:44
something um um worldly you know like watching a movie
47:50
that's going to have a lot of negative images and you sense a no then that
47:57
could be God but at the same time we should not rely on a voice saying the no
48:02
we should go when it comes to like making a decision like that like to watch a a a a movie that has negative
48:11
images negative words dark images like a scary movie or something we sh most of
48:18
the times usually God will not be speaking and no he actually wants us
48:24
to apply what we've learned in his word and make the decision not be like not
48:31
use he wants us to use our mind and the knowledge we've receive from him and
48:36
make a Godly decision you know we know I know that God wouldn't want me to watch
48:42
this so normally that's how God will speak is prior to the time in his word
48:48
revealing to you and then in the moment when it comes to making a decision
48:53
should I watch this no I know God has spoken to me in the past in his word before that I need to watch what I put
49:01
in my eyes that that that my eyes are a lamp lamp to my body and that if I fill
49:07
it with Darkness I'm feeling I feel my eyes with Darkness I'm filling my whole body with Darkness so God is spoking me
49:12
to that in the past so therefore he's speaking this to me now that I should not watch
49:18
this so that's going to be normally how God is speaking normally it's that God
49:24
wants to speak to you how he wants which is the main way he wants to speak is through his word like teaching you this
49:31
is how I want you to live this is how I want you to make decisions this is how I want you to
49:36
serve me and through the the spoken word like the teachings this is how you
49:41
should live you know I'm teaching you right now I've taught you today you know how to deal with offense how to deal
49:47
with persecution how to um um be obedient to God and speak up for him and
49:54
be a voice louder than the the voice of the Pharisees so I've I've so God's spoken to you God's speaking to you
50:01
right now this is your time that God is speaking most of the time the time God is speaking is in your reading the word
50:06
time and and in the live time the live stream time the church time hearing the
50:11
word of God it's like this is your appointment where God
50:17
speaks where he's teaching you and so now you know God's spoken to me this I
50:23
know this is how he wants me to act in this situation I know this is how he wants me to respond to this situation when the situation
50:29
arises so tonight or tomorrow or next week one of these situations arises a
50:37
you feel attack starting to attack of offense coming up at you and instead of being like God what are you saying right
50:43
now can you hear can you speak to me right now God is saying I've spoken and I'm speaking again by you Renewing Your
50:50
Mind to what I've spoken in that live stream on Friday I've spoken to you what to do in
50:57
this situation and so I'm speaking it now by you Renewing Your
51:03
Mind that's the main way that God speaks God speaks in other ways God speaks in
51:08
the God speaks in our spirit sometimes like suddenly like in a moment
51:14
yes go God speaks through signs God speaks through dreams he speaks in all these different
51:21
ways but the main way and what I found in my life the main way he speaks
51:27
is what I just shared with you the main way so it's important that we know God's
51:33
main way of speaking we're still open to hearing him
51:38
however he wants to speak we're not closed off to it but we know his main way of speaking
51:44
so we don't get distracted and confused by an angel of Light the devil mated
51:50
himself as an angel of Light we don't get um confused or
51:55
distracted um by looking too much into signs like ah God isn't speaking I want
52:01
to know what to do in this situation we we need to be mature and wise and realize God has already spoken to you
52:07
and this is how he wants you to live He's spoken to you he's he's shown you what it is to be Christlike now walk in
52:13
that renew your mind to what he had spoke before he's speaking now in this situation he's not speaking something
52:18
new he's not speaking something outside of the word of God outside of the word that's been taught to you outside of the
52:24
written word of God he's not speaking something new randomly in your head for the most
52:30
part God can speak a brand new thing out of the box like you know as I said but
52:36
that's the main way that God is speaking so when you know that it's like you rest you're not like I feel like God is so
52:44
quiet no he's spoken already to you and he's speaking again as you renew your
52:49
mind to what he spoke in the past he's speaking again now but it's not in the way we we like many times we want to be
52:55
an audible voice we want it to be like this distinct voice distinct word or something or big feeling and big
53:02
pull it's usually not that way so when you really grab this revelation of like
53:08
how God's main way of speaking is then you're going to be walking in wisdom
53:13
then you're going to be walking in the spirit then you're not going to be distracted by the angel of angel of
53:20
Light by other voices you you have this wisdom and maturity this is how God
53:25
speaks God spoken to me I'm not missing out um and and you have this revelation
53:31
of walking in the spirit by the spirit what if a person thinks wrongly
53:37
of you and comes to you with accusations if they're asking for clarification can you give it to them and still be a
53:43
person of no
53:52
reputation yes so let me just give you an example of my personal life like what
53:57
I've gone through with false accusations and everything so there was false accusations against me many years ago
54:05
and um just false accusations against my heart and my motives and my spiritual
54:10
father and all of that and like why I was in Ministry false accusations towards all of this and when I went to
54:18
Tanzania to my spiritual father's Church there was so for example I I so a seat at his
54:27
feet and so a lot of people long story short that and other things it looked
54:33
like I was worshiping him I was not I was only worshiping Jesus I was only honoring my spiritual father but because
54:40
of that action that people in America are not used to that bowing or kneeling
54:47
down before a servant of God is honor is honor it's not
54:53
worship um because many are not aware of that and also because of words that I had said at that time as a child in the
55:00
Lord not mature yet but a child in the Lord spoken with a good heart but spoken
55:07
not with wisdom like not spoken the right way that I would speak now with wisdom so because of all of that God led
55:15
me to address these accusations and um
55:21
clarify and even even though I said things with a pure heart
55:27
but because I said them child child um in a childish way I could see that some
55:34
maybe it would lead astray because they're they're taking my words wrong because I said them not the most Wise
55:41
Way even though I have a pure heart so I denounced words not because I was like I
55:47
was wrong and my heart was wrong I wasn't like um like saying I did the
55:53
really wrong thing it was that my words the way I spoke it was not was not the
55:59
best but my heart was in the right place so anyways I made a video and addressed
56:04
all of that um and so that was with the leading of the Holy Spirit a proper time
56:10
to publicly address that specifically to help others really
56:15
understand because it was really really really confusing for a lot of people um and so but then some so many
56:21
people they'll still they'll still you know ask me about this ask me about this
56:27
I am not going to make up a whole new video every year of my life every month
56:32
of my life every time somebody has a question when I've already answered it and it's already there available on the
56:38
internet um I'm not going to be distracted from doing the work of God by just appeasing people amen so um and
56:46
then a lot of people they speak against they'll say F false accusations against
56:52
me but you can see that um like if they
56:57
say false accusations against me but I know that I wasn't like doing anything wrong or in this case like my words
57:04
weren't childish it's just that people don't have the Revelation then um you you you have to
57:11
realize that if people aren't open to learn and have an understanding then it's going to be a waste of time to
57:19
try to explain so they can understand when they aren't even open to understanding so if people are speaking
57:26
against me for example making videos against me false accusations against me uh and they're doing it just because
57:33
they want to attack you know um and if people are seeing them and having questions but they're they're not
57:39
wanting to listen to the context they're not wanting because whenever if I ever share new wine God leads me with wisdom
57:46
to share in depth God leads me in wisdom to share in depth not to just speak like a new wine principle for
57:54
example um like God God you know calls me to not
58:00
just say Christians can have demons there's so many people that don't understand that right but I I so often
58:07
teach personally I teach so often how Christians can have demons you know I teach so much in depth
58:15
how this is H possible how this happens teaching about open doors teaching
58:21
biblically how Christians can have demons for example the Bible says Don't Give A fo hold to the devil and that's
58:27
speaking to Christians so it's basically saying don't leave the door open to the
58:32
devil well that's obviously speaking if you do leave the door open then the devil can come in that's what it's
58:39
speaking that's why it's saying don't do that so if you do that you Gap demons
58:44
very simple and that's in the Bible we have free will amen so I teach in depth
58:49
about that right so if people are going to say I don't understand you know
58:55
Christian you say Christians can have demons I'm not going to spend hours like answering every question that somebody
59:01
has of that when I have taught it in depth if a person really wants to learn
59:07
and know um and understand they can they can be a disciple they can go they can
59:13
go to my YouTube they can look at the teachings and maybe if you have find people that have questions like this you can you can do research we have um we
59:21
have playlists of all my messages with the titles you know so you can even search a title how can Christians have
59:26
demons if you type that one for example um you'll find it also I do teachings of how women can be why women
59:34
God has called women to be pastors and leaders and teachers and so you can search that on YouTube you can find it
59:40
so instead of um answering and answering and answering share share the video you
59:46
know so um back so so so what I shared with you I will what I shared with my
59:53
life I share that just to answer answer your question for how you can know how to respond in your own life for false
1:00:00
accusations against you for example if that's what the questions is question is asking and also part of the question
1:00:06
said um you know should we respond it sometimes to false accusations to these
1:00:13
things um well we still have no reputation by doing that you know
1:00:18
because Jesus was a man of no reputation and I've shared I've taught that we are supposed to be just like Jesus we are
1:00:24
supposed to be men and women of no rep reputation well the real revelation of that is not that we should be
1:00:31
like you know it's not that we are are like when
1:00:38
when people are speaking against us we're just supposed to be like like there could be times where you
1:00:45
can say oh no this is what I meant oh no this is the truth like it doesn't mean
1:00:50
like you you're called to be just completely like mute all the time
1:00:56
um if if people are speaking against you but for the most part uh it it's not the
1:01:04
place to be speaking up for yourself it's not the place to defend yourself God is called to be your Defender and
1:01:10
Vindicator so in the most most of the time because you know that these people
1:01:15
speaking against you I mean they're doing it whenever
1:01:21
people are speaking against you because that's not our calling so whenever people are speaking against you they they're being they're having the the
1:01:28
logs in their eyes looking at the speck in your eye and sometimes there might not even be a speck right so they're in
1:01:33
the wrong right they're not doing it with a good heart it's not our calling to judge it's not our calling to judge
1:01:40
our Our Calling is to look at the fruits so if we see there's something maybe there's bad fruits our calling is not to
1:01:48
um publicly humiliate and be the judge of a person that we see bad fruits and
1:01:55
let God be the judge amen so when you're seeing people that are um speaking
1:02:02
against you uh it's it's done with judgment it's done with hate
1:02:08
and and and you for the most part in most situations you defending yourself
1:02:14
is not going to really be helpful it's not going to change their minds
1:02:19
um it's just not going to do any good and God calls us to to let him be our
1:02:25
Defender let him be our Vindicator so um it's like when that hate and
1:02:31
attack happens we are it's part of our persecution and we're like we're not called to get bent out of bent bent out
1:02:38
of shape about it like I can't believe this person said this about me I need to
1:02:43
defend myself so that's being a person of reputation that's the time where it's
1:02:49
like no you need to let God defend yourself but if it's a situation like I shared before where you're like oh
1:02:55
there's genuine like serious confusion and so I should I need to clarify this this would be wisdom then that's the
1:03:02
right place to do that but the motive um like the motive of doing that shouldn't
1:03:09
be like I need to clear my name I can't believe people are speaking this about
1:03:14
me so I'm going to do this video or I'm going to make this statement and defend
1:03:20
myself so people can stop thinking bad about me so that should never be the motive
1:03:26
whenever God calls you to like uh you know address something that should never
1:03:32
be the motive it should always be for the purpose to um uh help people not be
1:03:37
confused and let astray for example um yeah so so that's that's the
1:03:46
meaning we're called to not just worry about our reputation at all not think about it at all we're just after God's heart and
1:03:53
wanting God's people to be in the truth so you know like for for the the fruits
1:03:59
show themselves for me when I find people being led
1:04:06
astray as people speak against me against my Ministry you know this is where God has led them to receive from
1:04:12
this is where God has led them to be planted this is where God has lead them to LED them to be set free be equipped
1:04:17
receive impartation like if I see that and then I see that um they've been
1:04:23
deceived they've been um let us astray by by the enemy speaking through people
1:04:29
lies um um I'm not thinking in my head like they don't think good about me
1:04:35
anymore I think I need to reach out to them or I need to make a video or I need to make a post because they used to
1:04:40
think good about me and now they aren't and now they're thinking wrong about me and I need I need to change their minds
1:04:49
no I I'm thinking about them and others wanting them to be in the truth
1:04:55
and be in the light and the way to do it is not to try to change their minds try to defend myself or or try to change how
1:05:02
they think about me but the way to do it is to be the brightest light I can be
1:05:07
for Jesus to speak his truth continue to speak his truth continue to do his work
1:05:13
continue to allow the anointing to grow in me for even more fruits to be shown um for for for God to be doing even more
1:05:21
things because I know if I when I as I say pure and I stay in the truth I know
1:05:27
that the truth will speak for itself the fruits will speak for itself God can show himself through me God can God will
1:05:34
show he's with me more and more eyes will open up and so if I see people that
1:05:40
let astray my heart Grieves for them like if they're called to to to be under
1:05:45
my Ministry and receive there that they've been LED astray from that my heart gries for them I'm not thinking
1:05:50
about my reputation my my heart is thinking about them but I know the only way that they can come back to Jesus and
1:05:56
receive from Jesus is if I keep doing what God has called me to do is if I
1:06:01
just let God keep pouring anointing through me and pour and show more fruits through me and show show more truth
1:06:06
through me and allow God to to to open up doors and and prove himself more
1:06:12
through me right and and so that's having nothing to do with thinking about how
1:06:19
people see me having nothing to do with trying to change Minds having nothing to
1:06:24
do with sticking up for myself or responding to attacks or false
1:06:32
accusations so we are called to be the light of the world and people will be attracted to Jesus in Us by being the
1:06:40
bright light so that's the way that's the way eyes will open up we can't control eyes of being opened up we can't
1:06:46
it's not going to be everyone's eyes opened up but we can do what we can do is be the brightest light we can be so
1:06:53
the most eyes open my most as possible will open up concerning like the right
1:06:59
way to pray for people like uh and so this answer I have
1:07:06
for you is not a quick answer so I have uh I have this answer in some YouTube
1:07:13
teachings um I'm trying to think of some of the titles of them um one of the titles of the
1:07:21
messages is order in the church which is just posted this week order in the church that's a very
1:07:27
important one for you all to go back and watch and apply order in the church to
1:07:33
make sure we're going in the order of God God's proper order we're not going out of order we're walking in the new
1:07:40
wine of of God's order because there's been a lot of disorder in the church
1:07:46
disorder the old wine bringing disorder religion bringing old war
1:07:53
bringing disorder so I encourage you all to go back and watch that important teaching just
1:07:59
posted to my YouTube this this week order in the church so I know that I
1:08:05
answer that question in that one I know that I also answer the question in how to cast heal the sick and cast out
1:08:12
demons effectively I can't remember if it's in the part one or part two that was from
1:08:18
the secret of the anointing series I did um so this can be found on my YouTube in
1:08:24
the playlists of secret of the anointing playlists um there
1:08:29
was two messages I taught together how to cast out demons and heal the sick so
1:08:34
I speak in depth the proper way to be praying for people um I also am trying
1:08:41
to remember if I have a recent message I know I have a past message but I think I might have a pre a recent message about
1:08:49
Authority I'm just giving you some resources where I really speak on this in depth and um the new wine so many are
1:08:57
not aware of yet so it's so important for you to understand there's just a lot of people that that that haven't receive
1:09:03
this Revelation yet of new wine uh it's okay but it's just important for us to
1:09:09
understand um when it comes to praying for people why it's many times it can be
1:09:16
out of order today is because this this this new thing that God is doing this revival this transformation of his bride
1:09:23
the church to look like how it in the Church his order uh the proper way to be
1:09:29
praying for people Healing The Sick casting out demons it's being pioneered
1:09:35
right now it's a new thing that God is doing so it will happen gradually like it will eyes will open up gradually it
1:09:42
won't eyes won't open up all at once but they will open up gradually and that's okay God's timing
1:09:49
is the best in terms of how this transformation takes place across the whole body of Christ
1:09:57
I just want to declare over all of you right now thank you Jesus
1:10:02
that you would increase in strength in the spirit that you would increase in
1:10:09
maturity and increase in wisdom increase in wisdom and knowledge
1:10:14
and revelation of the word of God and of God's ways and of God's
1:10:20
voice that you would be walking in his Spirit every moment every day day that
1:10:26
you wouldn't be confused but you would have Clarity you would have peace and that any attack of the enemy
1:10:35
that comes you would have Victory you would stand strong any attack of persecution you would have Victory and
1:10:41
you would stand strong and you would keep your peace in Jesus name I release
1:10:46
this anointing to you and I declare peace and strength to arise in you in
1:10:52

1:11:20
and joy and abundance to fill all of you in Jesus name
1:11:25
