0:00
can discernment be perverted by jealousy 100%
0:06
absolutely the Bible says that the pure in heart shall see God the pure in heart shall see God so the pure in heart shall
0:13
hear God's voice seeing God also means hearing God's voice recognizing what he
0:18
is speaking recognizing whom he is speaking through whom he is moving
0:24
through recognizing his Works recognizing his miracles his
0:30
deliverances his healings um that's also the meaning of
0:36
seeing God seeing God means all of these things and so um when it comes to
0:44
Discerning different people if they are if whether it's um leaders or whether
0:52
it's people of influence whether it's people who don't have really a big influence but are believers
1:00
everyone has their own opinions people speak different things so when you have
1:07
a pure heart this is how you have the right discernment this is how you can recognize this is God speaking this is a
1:14
work from God Etc so for example if it's just um any believer and they are
1:21
speaking something you can discern if this is God behind what they are speaking or not as you grow in wisdom
1:28
and discernment you can see God in someone or not you
1:34
know you can see like if this person is really walking with the Lord or not you
1:40
can see if this person is in you know following that voice of
1:46
religion is more like a Pharisee or if they have a pure heart
1:51
and are truly following the spirit of God um and then also when it comes to
1:57
Discerning leaders in the body of Christ Discerning Ministries Discerning um good
2:03
fruits versus versus bad fruits is God really with this person is this really the work of Jesus when you have a pure
2:09
heart you will have discernment the pure in heart shall see God so how to have real discernment from God you need to
2:16
have a pure heart what's an impure heart a heart that has selfish ambition so an
2:21
impure heart is a heart that has selfish ambition a heart that has um Pride a
2:26
heart that has jealousy that is an impure heart a heart that has
2:34
hatred a heart that wants bad for somebody
2:39
um a heart that is selfish so when you
2:44
have those things that's an impure heart the pure in heart shall see God the pure
2:50
in heart shall have discernment shall really hear God leading you shall recognize where God is recognize his
2:57
voice um but the devil is the ultimate deceiver
3:04
deceit comes through lies that's how deceit comes so he the devil tries to manipulate people with his lies he tries
3:12
to deceive people by his lies so what happens is when you are allowing these
3:17
things in your heart it's like you are agreeing with the
3:24
Enemy I mean if you are keeping these things in your heart these impure keeping now
3:30
we all are in a spiritual war where the devil can put thoughts in our mind
3:36
jealous thoughts hatred thoughts selfish ambition thoughts but we have the choice
3:42
to reject them or to keep them we have that choice we have that
3:47
Authority and so when we reject them when we say ew I don't want that thought of jealousy I don't want jealousy in me
3:54
I don't want to be jealous about somebody or ew I don't want selfish ambition in me I don't want self
3:59
selfishness in me this this strong desire I have all of a sudden now of
4:04
selfish ambition I don't want that in me ew no I reject it when you do that you
4:11
are disagreeing with the devil you are saying I do not want to be
4:18
a part of you devil I do not want your influence in my life I don't want your voice in my ear um I don't want any part
4:27
of you I I don't want any part of your agenda I don't want any part of your
4:33
heart of your impure heart devil that's what you're saying okay and you're saying I want God's heart I want God's
4:41
agenda I want God's plan I want God's will I want to be Godly um when you reject these lies of
4:50
the devil these thoughts of impurities when you reject them okay so the thing
4:55
is is that a lot of people they are not reject ing these things they they are
5:02
not rejecting the jealous
5:09
thought you know they they they see somebody jealousy jealous come jealous
5:15
thought comes and they they stew on it they feed it they accept
5:22
it when they do that this can be selfish ambition too they you want something
5:29
you're thinking about it how much you want something in a selfish way um you're thinking on it thinking on
5:35
you're accepting it and then that's becoming even more in you okay so the more you're ex like not
5:44
rejecting the devil's thoughts the devil's lies the more you are going to his
5:53
side he's the ultimate deceiver I've heard the story this a
5:59
Satanist say an ex Satanist say how the devil would tell him like I'll give you
6:05
love I'll give I'll love you and that was part of the reason why this person
6:11
would follow the devil is because this person didn't have that from like parent
6:16
parents growing up um and so we believe the devil's lies so you have people like this that
6:24
are just living in deceit you have people like this that don't start out blat wanting to do evil but they listen
6:34
to The Devil's lies they accept the devil's lies and then they become in they they start to live in deceit they
6:40
they start because to hear God is it you know is not just for
6:46
everybody you have to make the choice to hear God you have to make the choice to be spiritual you have to make the choice
6:53
to be strong spiritually reject the devil's lies and be so adamant so
6:58
surrendered so obedient I want God's will over my life completely I want to be completely obedient to God you have
7:05
to be so serious about that and when you do that your spiritual ears open to hear
7:10
God's voice you are giving permission for God to reveal himself to you and he becomes
7:17
revealed to you his ways become revealed you have understanding you remember how Jesus would teach in Parables and he
7:23
would teach when he was teaching his disciples he would one time he was saying like these Pharisees they have
7:29
ears but they don't hear so I could teach and teach and teach and teach and spend so much time trying to teach them
7:34
but they will never hear they will never hear they will never really hear what
7:39
I'm saying and so he's saying that this is the Pharisees Choice it doesn't matter what I speak it doesn't matter
7:46
how much I try to explain it they will never be able to hear me because of their choice to not hear
7:52
me so it it's a choice to be able to have ears that can hear God eyes that
7:58
can see God the pure in heart shall see God it's a choice to be pure so if you make the
8:05
choice to keep on allowing impurity in your heart um you're you're what you're
8:12
doing is you're opening the door and giving excess to the devil to feed you more and more and more lies and
8:19
now when he spoke the lies before you wanted them I don't mean you but I'm saying
8:25
like when people do not reject certain lies like this like jealousy selfish ambition Pride when they don't reject
8:32
those lies they're they're they're wanting them they they are wanting them
8:40
technically they are technically wanting they're technically wanting to not be pure like that's their
8:48
choice so they're they're actually in the spiritual realm technically they're saying I want the devil to speak to me
8:55
and I want the devil's lies to be truth I want the devil lies to be my truth like I
9:00
think this is true I think this is right I think this is um good this is what I
9:06
want is the devil's lies like that's what that's what they're saying as an action of keeping hanging on to the
9:14
devil's lies and not rejecting them and so they start to go in this place of
9:20
Deceit they start to go in this place of Deceit and they can go further and further down this rabbit hole and this
9:27
is where you have people that are so sure of things um but they're completely
9:32
wrong they're saying thus says the Lord God has sent me to do this and it's doing a work of the devil
9:38
actually it's it's bringing destruction um it's trying to divide
9:44
God's Kingdom for example people can be so adamant and sure of sounding sure and confident of this but it's because
9:51
they've accepted the voice of the enemy and this has just become their lifestyle
9:56
this has become their Doctrine now this has become there what they think
10:02
is good the good thing to do for their life you know so to answer the question
10:07
can um what was the question can jealousy Cloud discernment I think it was
10:12
something like that pervert discernment yeah absolutely like the
10:18
more we are are are stand firm to accept God's truth only the more we have
10:24
Crystal Clear discernment the more we can accurately hear God's voice
10:30
and then the opposite is true so that's why it's so important for believers to
10:35
um recognize this truth and not just listen to anybody that says thus says the Lord and says that God has sent me
10:43
to do this and you know it's so important because you need to know as a Believer there are those who are
10:48
surrendered to God and there are those who are not there are those who are pure and have chosen
10:54
Purity and have done the steps to choose Purity they've rejected the devil's Liv they've picked up their cross they've
11:00
surrendered and there are those who do not there are those who have chose the path of lukewarm there are those who
11:06
have chose to not reject the devil's lies there are those who have chosen um
11:11
the impure way the impure heart so important you realize that so that you
11:16
don't get confused or deceived um out of people's confidence
11:22
or Zeal just like Saul who became Paul look how zealous Saul was that the
11:27
followers of Jesus deserve to be killed that they were Blasphemous they were Heretics they were false prophets look
11:34
how zealous he was right but he was completely wrong his eyes were completely
11:40
shut Jesus opened up his eyes and he repented and he became Apostle
11:47
Paul I've had freedom from so much Hallelujah but I'm still struggling with anger and irritability especially when
11:53
I'm weak in a weakened place from sickness lack of sleep or hormones how
11:59
do I have
12:09
victur I first want to say that we need to have you need to have Grace for
12:15
yourself as a human as a human when we are tired like
12:24
when we've been through really hard things
12:31
you know we are not really ourselves
12:36
sometimes ourselves is who we are our true self is who you
12:41
are um on a good day on a good day when you are
12:49
um when you are full of energy when you are full of joy when Lots when you're
12:55
not passing through a storm when you know when things just all these
13:03
horrible things aren't like happening to you or something like the way you are
13:09
just so excited to like praise God and you you just you just feel so zealous to
13:18
love on people and you just have so much natural energy and strength the way you are like that
13:25
that's that's the real you that's the real you and
13:32
um God really spoke this to me one day and it really helped free me from
13:39
condemnation and helped me to be more confident in God's love for me and who I
13:45
am in Christ it it it it helped me be more confident in my love for God as well
13:54
because like on I would notice that on mountaintops
13:59
I naturally just like wanted to shout on rooftops about God's faithfulness and his goodness and then um in valleys or
14:10
in in hard waiting Seasons I still loved God so much and I still was obeying him
14:17
and serving him but I didn't feel like the same exact way as I did on mountain
14:22
tops inside I didn't have this like wild
14:27
energy um of like praise praise praise but I was choosing to praise God I was choosing to
14:33
love God I was choosing to be obedient but I didn't have as much is like that wild enthusiasm and I remember I would
14:41
see these patterns and then one time the Lord really spoke to me and he said the
14:46
real you is you on a good day you know don't like the the the that Zeal that
14:54
passion that fire that's the real you and so on other days where you don't feel feel that way naturally don't see
15:01
yourself as like oh this is who I am now or this is who I've become or something
15:07
um or I've lost my fire don't see yourself that way um have Grace and
15:14
understanding that you're going through hard things and you're a human Jesus was sweating blood in the Garden of
15:21
Gethsemane um and this was before he went on the cross this was just
15:27
like going through the person ution that he was at that time and just knowing how
15:32
Judas betrayed him and knowing prophetically what was to
15:37
come that's a lot he was going through that's a lot that was going on in his
15:44
mind it's a lot and so he was sweating
15:49
blood because like of of this heaviness um before even he was being
15:57
scored whipped in the prison um and put on the cross it
16:03
was before that you know that he was going he was really in a valley and
16:08
going through such intense time where because he's a he's a human he was
16:15
um he was sweating he was um sweating blood
16:21
uh and saying Lord take this cup if you can but above all let your will be done
16:27
so that was like a human moment and he there's nothing wrong with that prayer because he said above all let your will
16:34
be done he was just being real like this is difficult and I would prefer to not
16:40
do this but but but but above what I prefer let your will be done so that day
16:46
was different than a day where the will of God is fun and you're like preaching to everyone like the will of God is the
16:53
best thing in the whole world look at how God's blessed me like that day of
17:00
preaching is very different than that day in the Garden of Gethsemane you know
17:07
and um so like I what I I say that to say is that
17:14
like you need to First have Grace on yourself in terms of the feelings Department
17:21
um and just have Grace on yourself when things are tough when things are hard um
17:28
God has for you Jesus went through these hard things he has compassion he has
17:33
understanding the reason why I'm first saying that it's important you have Grace because that's an important step
17:40
to to grow stronger to even be Christlike in your weaknesses to be
17:46
Christlike still when you're tired or when things are hard that you can still make the choice to be
17:52
Christlike you have to first be so grounded in God's love for you and seeing yourself rightly
17:59
um and also like in those times of weakness to know God's with you and he
18:06
understands and he has compassion for you and he's going to help you still be obedient to him still um serve serve him
18:14
well and represent him well to be looking at him rightly like that that's
18:20
how you gain the the power and the strength um and so to make that it's
18:26
important to make that intention to make that practice when you find it's like a a weakness day
18:33
or you're really tired or things are hard that you in the morning like in the
18:38
beginning of the day if you're just going through something just recognize I need more of God's help
18:45
today to be obedient completely to be Christlike to represent him well and so
18:51
Lord I Look to You and I ask you to help me and I receive your power your strength and my life and I know I can do
18:57
all things through you who strengthens me um that's how you can can gain that
19:05
strength and um and to not see that that that God's
19:12
just like looking at you judging or something because that's what happens sometimes in weakness places maybe a
19:18
mistake happens maybe you're not like you don't respond as Christlike as
19:23
usually um and what the enemy will want to do will some many times do is bring condemnation
19:30
and what what what's not good to do is to allow that voice of condemnation to
19:36
just continue to show up anytime there's a a time of weakness because then it'll just be like a spiral
19:43
by listening to the voice of condemnation you're doing the opposite of turning to God's voice and hearing his voice of love hearing his voice of
19:49
compassion and understanding and being proud of you so um whatever area it is
19:56
that you find your a weakness in still and and then when when there's those weak days you you find that you are not
20:03
Christlike or you make a mistake in this area you sin in this area renounce that
20:08
renounce you know renounce that you know on on hard days that I give this sin or
20:15
I give into this I renounce that and that will not happen again because I believe and I receive that God
20:23
is with me and I receive his help I receive his strength um and so it's it's really just
20:30
having that belief that that you can do it that God can help you and rejecting the devil's lies and making that
20:36
intention being proactive about it how to be more consistent I feel like
20:41
sometimes I don't reject lies quick enough because I don't even realize they're there for a minute like if I'm
20:46
focused on something else like listening to a teaching um well as long as you're
20:54
focused on God and like listening if you're listening to a teaching and you feel like you didn't reject a lie after
21:00
like it was there for a minute it's okay you know you don't it you don't need to feel like religious
21:06
about it or or like you like there's something you have to attain of perfection um when I say reject those
21:14
lies I'm not saying like you have to reject them the second you hear them I
21:21
mean yeah reject them the second you hear them but it's not something like if
21:26
it took you one minute for until you rejected it you've lost the battle no no
21:31
no no no no no no no no no no no no no because um I mean it's it's really powerful to
21:39
reject the LIE whether it's the second it pops in your head or if you were just
21:45
focused on focused on a teaching for example that's a beautiful good thing and you realize a minute later oh that's
21:51
a lie you reject it then that the the important thing is like once you have
21:57
that revelation This Is A Lie reject it reject it that's
22:03
the important thing you know it's so important that you don't um be turning in
22:11
this walk of a walking Dominion walk of authority life that we're doing as
22:18
something religious you know it's important that you don't turn in you know it's important you don't turn the new wine teachings to old wine it's
22:27
important you don't allow the enemy to try to infiltrate that in to the
22:34
teachings you know it's so important you you abide by this understanding of God's
22:40
grace of God's love of God's compassion and that he's not a religious
22:46
like dictator and just watching over you with like a like a judge um have you
22:52
done this perfectly um but he's looking at the heart so important you abide by
22:57
that thinking how do we act polite when we know the enemy is speaking through
23:03
someone I usually reject it in my mind is this enough um yeah I mean if you are in a place where I don't know like the
23:09
workplace or maybe with family you're an area where you're just like close to people who are speaking um by the enemy
23:18
enemy speaking through them um just renew your mind to see them with Jesus's eyes to see that they are a beloved
23:24
child of God they truly are to have God's heart for them remember how Saul
23:30
was transformed to Paul so to have that those eyes that perspective that even
23:35
though this person is allowing the enemy to use them right now God still has a
23:40
plan for their life if they choose it God still wants to save them redeem them and even use them mightily in the
23:47
kingdom of God that's God's plan for their life so I will choose to have this perspective of love for this person and
23:55
um Renewing Your Mind of how we are called to love our enemies um so you
24:02
know just renew your mind in these times if you're if this is a struggle if this is hard like in the moment renew your
24:08
mind with these things and that will help you to number one
24:13
just not speaking negative words towards them uh and to be able to be loving to
24:21
them still being polite when repenting is it important to
24:27
apologize to the person you sinned against or is it more about your changed heart posture towards
24:34
God so this just depends on the situation basically if you have hurt
24:40
somebody if you've caused damage to somebody you should apologize to them
24:45
because this will help bring healing to them you know
24:50
um you know I mean if you are used if if you did spoke a negative word you know
24:58
about somebody or just did a negative action towards someone that can cause hurt that can
25:05
cause pain that can cause um stumbling block sometimes for
25:12
somebody it can be a trauma um sometimes the enemy can move
25:18
through trauma and bring oppression you know and so it's important to not take
25:25
lightly uh if you've caused some sort of harm to another person one negative word
25:32
can really the enemy can really move through one negative word many times you know somebody's not
25:40
trying to be used by the enemy and they really love God but they speak a Nega they choose to speak a negative word and
25:45
the enemy hops on it and the enemy really uses that and you don't know what's going on in
25:51
the other person's life maybe that word really the enemy really worked hard
25:57
through that word and um cause struggle in their life through that word
26:03
insecurity uh fear things like this
26:08
so when you realize like if if this was you like if you caused harm to somebody
26:14
any way in any way you spoke negatively to somebody
26:19
um the action you made was negative when you realize that and you feel sorry and you repent
26:27
you should AP oliz to them so it can bring healing to them so that the
26:32
enemy's lies can be exposed and rejected out of their life because maybe there's
26:37
maybe you know that negative word the enemy's really tried to push on them that like it's true you know and so just
26:45
that word of apology um can really free them can do a
26:52
big a great huge thing in the spiritual realm for that person
26:58
so um and and then this is another side note like if there's some people that
27:04
speak negatively online about people say things that are not true say things that are judgmental
27:10
um say things about ministers Ministries negatively online um that aren't true that are
27:18
judgmental and so God is absolutely 100% calling that
27:24
person to repent publicly and to say that they were wrong publicly and to
27:30
apologize publicly because that will help help it's the
27:36
same principle it will help uh clear the damage that was caused by The Lies by
27:43
the negative words help people to know the truth see the
27:48
truth um and so yeah so that's the one side but then if you have been thinking
27:56
negatively about somebody you know maybe it was like jealousy and
28:03
the the devil came and and
28:08
um was trying to make you jealous of somebody and you didn't reject those those thought those thoughts but if you
28:16
never acted on those thoughts you you you don't necessarily have to like tell the person that can
28:22
just be something you repent before God because it it was just there in your heart and didn't
28:29
come out but many times when we keep things in our heart for a while the Bible says that what's in your heart
28:35
it'll come out of your mouth so sometimes
28:40
um you know if a person is thinking negatively about somebody in their heart they'll start to act negatively towards
28:46
that person so in that case you know you should apologize you can also share I was dealing with thoughts from the devil
28:53
about you and I wasn't rejecting them and it was causing me to like treat you wrongly so I apologize and I repent and
29:00
I reject those lies of the devil and this is who you are and confess the truth about who they are you can do that
29:07
um you know you don't have to like go into all like these huge details if that's the case of things in your heart
29:13
that you if you didn't act on all the things that you know were going on in your heart but maybe if it was just a
29:19
preliminary thing where there were things in your heart you were thinking negatively about somebody but it wasn't
29:25
for a long time so fortunately it didn't lead to negative actions towards that person in most cases you wouldn't need
29:33
to go to the person and tell them all that was going on in your heart um you can just repent to God about
29:47
that but it also just depends I mean sometimes you can feel convicted sometimes the Bible says confess your
29:53
sins um publicly so I mean it's not like it's bad had ever to in most cases to
30:01
confess like man I've been sitting in this areas I just want to confess this I just maybe want accountability you know
30:09
so you shouldn't feel like it's like wrong to confess things it's just about
30:15
knowing what I'm sharing is like to not feel like you like something religious
30:20
or that you haven't really repented if you're not telling all these people or telling the specific person's a thought
30:27
that you had about them many times like but like if it's
30:34
your spiritual leader many times it's important to be like fully honest and
30:40
like you need you need freedom in this area so to confess that is to be fully
30:45
open and fully honest and say I don't want any of this in it's it's like part
30:51
of being open before God because God uses vessels and you are uh submitted
30:56
planted under your spiritual leader so so it's it's an area of surrender to God
31:01
to be honest and and say like I need help I need this power of God I need
31:07
freedom in this area um as God uses vessels as God uses your leader it's
31:12
good in those cases many times to be honest and to just confess and to not to
31:17
to to to Really make it a Firm Stance devil I don't want this anymore in my life a person received freedom but then
31:24
their life went turned into immediate refining fire this person lost their job
31:30
is now depressed because of that I believe and has back pain so um there's
31:37
a cost to becoming a disciple of Jesus there's a cost uh the cost is part of the cost is
31:44
refining fire because we don't become more like Jesus and transformed and a
31:50
usable vessel of him without the refining fire without going through hard things without God allowing the enemy to
31:57
attack back temporarily for us to defeat that battle and rise above it um and
32:04
come out stronger you know that's a cost you think about when you when you look at
32:10
the story of David and all he went through to be who God called him to be to be a follower of God disciple um he
32:19
went through such ridiculous things like the one he had blessed so much Saul
32:28
trying to kill him taking armies out to try to kill him just because of
32:34
jealousy God allowed that this was the cost this was part of the cost of being
32:39
a follower of God this was part of the cost of being whom God had called him to be as anointed king Joseph was thrown in
32:46
the pit by his brothers to die was then sold to slavery was then lied on by a
32:53
woman and then thrown in jail because the lie was believed and God allowed all of that why
32:59
because that was a cost David and Joseph they came out Victorious through it all
33:05
these attacks were temporary I mean these hard things they had to go through were temporary they were temporary it
33:11
was something they had to pass through it was a battle they had to fight and win fight the good fight of faith and
33:18
win and um there was reward that come that came
33:24
with that and there is Heavenly rewards that come with all of this so um the disciples they were persecuted
33:32
they were most of them were martyred before they were martyred they were persecuted so much
33:40
worse than we are persecuted today for the most part that the their
33:45
level of pers persecution the hard things they had to go through was so
33:51
much worse you know we deal with negative words lies towards us but they
33:58
dealt with being physically imprisoned being beaten um being told they literally
34:05
cannot speak the name of Jesus we have freedom of religion here and for the
34:11
most part Mo most people have freedom of religion in the world um so but that was the cost of
34:20
being a disciple and and I posted this today actually Jesus says count the cost
34:26
like it's powerful he says count the cost to becoming a disciple there's you got to pick up your cross and it's
34:32
powerful it's a powerful scripture because it's like saying like this is where true life is when you
34:39
give your life to Jesus true life true Abundant Life this is the only way only place that there is freedom Abundant
34:45
Life peace Joy contentment and salvation where you will go to heaven when you die
34:52
for eternity and you'll have relationship with God which is what brings you this contentment and peace
34:57
and joy um this relationship with God here and now like this is the most incredible
35:04
beautiful life and the only li like the only way of true life actually is surrender to Jesus but like you also
35:12
need to understand there's a cost to it it is so worth it anything with value has cost we are willing to um spend tons
35:20
of money on a an apartment to rent or a house to to buy um a car hard to drive
35:29
close to where we are totally willing and down with it like we're totally fine
35:36
with we're not like furious at the waiter for giving us a bill you know I
35:41
mean we're we we've counted the cost we count the cost we pay the cost we move
35:47
on we don't fret about it we don't get angry about it we don't get upset about it so um yeah I was really meditating on
35:56
this scripture lately how like we get the most amazing life
36:02
with Jesus but there is a cost but the cost is so little compared to what we
36:07
gain through Christ and it's so worth
36:13
it it's so worth it you know I mean it's it's like if you go this is probably a
36:20
silly example but like if you have a really good meal and it's like maybe it's like it's a meal that's
36:30
expensive but it tastes like so good like so much better than the cheap meals
36:36
that you usually have are you going to like complain to the waiter when he comes are you going to say like how dare
36:43
you charge me this much I've never charged this much for anything in my life like all the other restaurants
36:49
they're charging this amount like no you know it was worth it it had
36:56
value you counted the cost you chose to go to this restaurant that is more
37:02
expensive because for a reason because you wanted better tasting food and so you can peacefully pay the
37:09
bill and not be upset about it not be angry about it not cause a fuss right and so um it's kind of a silly example
37:17
but this is our life with Jesus like the life we gain we we don't many times we
37:23
take it for granted and we don't realize the alternative if we don't surrender to Jesus the alternative
37:28
is hell is torment is bondage is sickness it's it's awful and is an
37:36
eternity of hell and then surrendering our life to Jesus so we do have to go through persecution we do have to go
37:42
through those battles we do have to go through UND difficult times unfun times but it is so worth it the C the cost is
37:49
expensive but it's not that expensive compared to what we gain like it is
37:55
expensive it is it is expensive it it is a big
38:01
cost but it's it's small though like it's worth
38:07
it it doesn't even match what we gain you know and this is a perspective we
38:14
don't have as Believers a lot of the time and the enemy can deceive people so
38:20
easily when things get hard through Battles Through refining fire that God's
38:25
allowing the enemy can comes with this deceit like making you forget what he's done for you making you disvalue it
38:32
trying to get you to disvalue it and trying to feed you with lies
38:39
like where is God you know things like this um that's a scheme of the devil to
38:47
pull you away from being a true disciple so
38:52
uh it's really empowering to think about
38:58
how little the cost is compared to what we gain and how how it's even a smaller cost than the disciples the apostles
39:05
that went before us have paid doesn't change the fact that it hurts sometimes that it's not fun that
39:12
it's very uncomfortable sometimes that there may be tears sometimes doesn't change that fact but man it's worth it
39:20
and so there is a cost there is a cost the refining fire it's tempor orary it's
39:28
temporary it's not staying like this life is not staying like this you're in the middle
39:35
of the battle right now but Victory is coming you're in the middle of the battle right now but Victory is coming
39:43
this two Shall Pass Hallelujah can you please expand on how
39:49
refining fire increases before breakthrough
39:55
comes so
40:02
you become promoted in the spiritual realm you God lifts you after you have passed
40:14
tests job was lifted to receive double than what he had before
40:21
in terms of blessings after he was tested
40:28
so being you know because the Reason God lifts you which lifting looks like an increase
40:36
in influence for his glory to reach more other to reach others for his name so he
40:45
can use you to reach others and um lifting also comes with
40:51
blessings like that's a way of lifting is blessings and rewards like what hope
40:58
experienced you see Joseph Joseph and David when they were once lifted to that
41:03
place of being King and being second to the king
41:10
um it came with both that influence so that God could use them to reach more
41:16
people but it also came with blessings and rewards so that was lifting but when
41:25
both of their cases the lifting came came not it be they had they had
41:32
to they had to be going through they had to go through spiritual
41:37
tests to really rise up in the rank spiritually like when you when you go
41:46
through a battle a testing a battle that God uses as a test so battle is like the
41:53
Devil comes and attacks you many usually it's through people lots of times it's through people attacking you Devil comes
41:59
through somebody God allows it to attack to attack you now the devil's trying to
42:05
stop you but God the Bible says God never allows you to he doesn't allow Temptations to
42:12
come that you cannot that you cannot overcome so God is smart he knows this
42:19
kind of battle that's coming this kind of attack from the enemy he knows that because of your heart and because of how
42:26
he's molded you in the past coming to this point you'll be able to have victory over
42:32
this you will it's still up to us we still have the free will but God has given us what we
42:40
need so God then allows that attack then you have Victory and once you have
42:48
Victory what's happened is you've gone through something different you've gone through something you never gone through before you've gone through something
42:54
more difficult and and and you doing that and having victory means that you've choosen
43:00
Faith choosen obedience choosen humility chose chosen surrender and you've done these things in a a new way a higher way
43:09
a different kind of way because of this hard thing that came but you still chose Faith you still
43:15
chose humility you still chose obedience you still chose surrender you still chose to be obedient in all things
43:23
including staying focused on what God has called you to do do the work of God stay strong be fir stand firm in the
43:30
word of God believe the word of God confess the word of God uh not choosing to not doubt okay so you've done all of
43:37
these things in a new way you've done you've exhibited faith and surrender in
43:43
a new way and so with that it's like you've you've defeated a more difficult
43:50
battle and with that you become higher in the spiritual
43:56
realm you've become [Music] um stronger spiritually you've become
44:02
stronger in faith uh and and so you are more of a leader you're more of a leader that can
44:09
be entrusted with more influence that can be trusted with more blessing because you have to be ready
44:14
for the blessing so the blessing doesn't Crush you so that you receive the blessing to bless
44:20
others you know um you receive the blessing and don't take pride from it but become humbled even more
44:27
right so um then the lifting comes so David Joseph they went through those
44:37
attacks after choosing God they chose God already they love God already they
44:42
were serving God already they were going through things already David was going through fighting the Lions and the Bears
44:49
and then he went through fighting Goliath he was going through things so they were already on this Faith Journey
44:55
they were already passing tests they were already um climbing up you know growing stronger
45:03
spiritually and then came the biggest attack of them
45:09
all then came the biggest testing of them all now they were ready for this because the greatest lifting of all was
45:16
about to come so that there had to be the the biggest
45:22
battle the biggest testing that they were now prepared for so
45:27
um that's what's going on in the spiritual realm that's what's going on in the spiritual
45:34
realm that's why there's the the most [Music]
45:39
um Warfare refining fire before the biggest breakthrough it's all planned by
45:45
God you know you it's and it's part of shaping you it's part of transforming you I know the attack I had gone
45:53
through persecution I went through three years ago totally shaped me totally
45:58
transformed me totally totally transformed me totally took me higher
46:04
spiritually in terms of like made me have more faith and I've literally seen the evidence of it now because now going
46:11
through in these days ever since going through persecution I literally feel
46:16
different I literally feel different I literally can feel more faith in me I
46:23
literally can feel more strength I literally can feel feel more peace and joy than I did before going through
46:30
similar things hallelujah how did that happen that happened through the transformation that happened through
46:36
that refining fire of that previous battle so I became literally a different person I became stronger I became more
46:43
like Jesus glory to God that literally happened um Hallelujah and so that it's
46:51
like how God lifts how God transforms how our Faith grows how we
46:58
become more like Christ how God releases blessings when you realize this and this
47:04
is all throughout the Bible like it's very clear it's nothing like super profound what I'm saying it's really all
47:11
over the Bible but the thing is is like you have to see that the Bible is for us today you have to see that this is these
47:17
aren't just like stories that will make make a good movies um this this is for us today this
47:25
is an example for us today this is what we can expect for our lives
47:34
today this is a part of counting the cost and what has
47:41
strengthened me so much especially in recent recent times of battles recent
47:46
times of persecution the thing that strengthened me the most has been counting the
47:54
cost has been renewing my mind with that
48:00
scripture like I've chosen to be a disciple I have to pay the cost God has this great plan for my life
48:07
God has this big assignment for my life that requires a bigger
48:14
cost it's worth it though but but it's okay so that really helps me to not hear
48:22
the devil's lies and to see it for what it really is and to not be selfish why
48:30
do I have to pay this why is this happening to me this is unfair how can this be happening to me
48:37
this is so not fair it helps to not like take things personally and be um selfish
48:44
honestly because I signed up to pay the price when I said yes to Jesus to
48:51
becoming his disciple and also when I said yes to this calling when I said to
48:57
this calling I didn't sign up for an easy ride to the calling I signed up for a bigger cost
49:05
God's like Catherine I'm calling you to pay a greater cost as my disciple than
49:10
others will I'm calling to pay but this is this is the deal it's but it's worth
49:16
it and I'm going to be able to do great things through you and and bless many lives and bring many people to Kingdom
49:23
but this is the truth it's a bigger cost for you you than others like we need to
49:30
um know that word that Jesus speaks you know take it to heart take it to heart
49:37
this is part of being a disciple okay okay Lord okay Lord and so when it comes you
49:44
say okay this is paying the price time okay I signed up for this willingly so
49:51
therefore I will not complain I will keep my joy I will keep my peace and um
49:58
I won't throw a fit for paying the cost I won't be silly and and throw a
50:05
fit throw a fit at the waiter how foolish would somebody look at pay and sometimes you see that happen
50:12
right in real life you say you see people complaining over things like maybe the food wasn't cooked properly
50:17
how they wanted it or something and they throw a huge fit and they look foolish right like mistakes happened or maybe
50:24
there's miscommunication like we we um we need to grow up and um be
50:31
respectful towards God right and you know not complain for things um that are
50:40
actually intended for our good and that God has been clear to us about and that
50:45
we have agreed to and signed up for amen it should be exciting to pay
50:51
the price too because it's like when you pay the price when you swipe the card
50:57
for the clothing then you get the clothing
51:03
right um when you you know when you pay
51:08
the rent then you get to go in the house when you pay for the car then you get to drive the car away so you paying the
51:15
price is a sign of the blessings coming and God's will being done in your life
51:20
that it's coming you're getting very close Hallelujah and um
51:27
and also like every time that I've seen uh attack of the enemy like the most
51:33
severe kinds of attacks of the enemy persecution every time it has been
51:40
um in a time where the like the enemy was so angry
51:47
at what what God was doing through me it
51:53
was very clear it was very clear like it was like oh of course he's he's very angry
52:02
because of do got is open because of the testimonies and the Miracles taking
52:08
place because of growth because of growth in Min the ministry different
52:14
things it's it's been very obvious to see the timing of things the timing of
52:21
attacks and so to see it with a godly perspective is to see
52:28
Hallelujah the devil's mad There's real damage being caused to
52:34
the devil's Kingdom The Works of the devil are really being destroyed God's kingdom is advancing
52:42
rapidly so much so that the devil is losing his mind is I mean is losing it
52:48
trying to do whatever he can to try to stop it
52:54
Hallelujah that should be humbling encour encouraging exciting and
53:02
humbling that's you know we are that's why you know that's one of
53:07
the reasons why blessed are those who are persecuted for Jesus's
53:15
sake part of the reason you're blessed is because the persecution comes when
53:22
God is able to really use you when you are really being a vessel a
53:29
powerful vessel for God that is when persecution
53:35
comes so that's a great joy That's so exciting and it's also humbling it's
53:42
also humbling that wow it's a wakeup call like God is really able to move
53:49
through me and destroy the devil's Works glory to God
53:57
I Joy I take joy in the insults I take joy in the persecution then praise
54:03
God hallelujah when people around you at work do not
54:09
receive Jesus's move in his Revival do I just love them and be who God called me to be and not bring it up until they ask
54:17
yeah I mean I I share about this a lot um so I encourage you to watch other subscriber q&as cuz I address this a lot
54:25
just how to be the light in the world how to love with gentleness and kindness
54:31
and not be pushy or religious you know I shared this a lot so I encourage you to check out past subscriber Q&A they're on
54:36
my YouTube you can see them all just for more about this but I'll just share right now shortly um yeah I mean share
54:46
first of all your social media is such a powerful tool because this is like where you get to really share your
54:53
heart and it's your personal page so you don't need to feel like you need to please somebody through your social
54:59
media page you shouldn't you should be pleasing God through your social media page and this is a big place where you
55:06
can showcase your faith and you can really be loud and proud share share
55:13
share what God is doing and people will see and um people won't
55:20
get mad or offended if you're posting so much well I mean what I mean is they
55:27
will not feel like you are trying to shove Jesus down their throats because they understand that this is your
55:35
personal page your your social media page is kind of like your your house your room you can decorate it how you
55:40
want like the outside of your house you can paint it how you want people may judge you for it people may not like how
55:45
you painted your house but it's your house you know you don't need to you you
55:51
should be unashamed of how you express yourself with your house
55:56
and so in your social media page you should feel unashamed with how you express yourself and you should see it as an obligation from God responsibility
56:04
to shine your light there and just share what God is doing this is a place where you have influence where you have a
56:09
voice and if people don't want to hear it they can unfollow you they can defriend you if they want but this is
56:16
your place to speak the truth of Jesus and share what he's doing but then when
56:21
it comes to relationships um it's just in workplace it's just important to shine your light
56:27
with wisdom so the biggest way we shine our lights is by being loving by being Christlike and and showing the love of
56:34
God to them showing our joy showing our peace speaking with kind words not gossiping
56:40
Etc and that will be attracting and so those people that feel attracted to you
56:46
attracted to Friendship attracted to well I mean I don't mean just if they
56:51
feel attracted to you that you should like hang out with them all the time I talk a lot about boundaries a lot so check out my videos on that you can I
56:58
have a playlist called relationships where I talk about boundaries and all of
57:03
that I won't get into that right now but but what I mean is if someone feels drawn to talk to you more at work for
57:08
example um because you're shining your light now this is a time where you know they're opening up and they are Desiring
57:15
to hear more about your life more about what you're interested more about your passions more of what made you who you
57:20
are why you're so joyful and everything and so now you could be sharing your testimony sharing about um what God is
57:27
doing sharing about Jesus but um to start out with you can as people
57:34
are you know open to it you can share your testimony and share about what Jesus is
57:41
doing in his Revival now and if people are don't want to hear it you know then
57:49
be respectful and don't shove it down their throats but keep being the light keep shining keep shining on your social
57:55
media you know but yeah you shouldn't be pushy and forceful and keep bringing things up
58:01
if someone is very against very resistant but it should but don't let
58:07
that influence your personal life don't that let that influence your light don't let that don't like for example like if
58:14
you had a shirt about God's power or something you know don't be uh oh like
58:21
feel like bad about wearing it to work or something like that you know don't be afraid about what you post because of
58:29
some people that follow you they don't they're they don't want to hear about Jesus don't let it affect that but I'm
58:36
just talking about in terms of bringing things up and conversation everything you do not need to be like shoving it to
58:41
them you shouldn't be that was like forceful um and not gentle if they've been resistant at one point do we stop
58:48
talking to someone when defending the work of God just with wisdom um it's
58:55
different every situation really walk with wisdom with the Holy Spirit
59:02
um basic a big in indication of what that wisdom will look like is as you've
59:10
spoken what is you've defended as you feel you should have in the proper way
59:18
um to the extent that you should have and the person doesn't want to listen um
59:24
and it's turning into just back and forth is turning into a real
59:30
argument before it turns into that actually is when you should stop so um
59:38
it is important to defend the work of God um but we are not called to like keep
59:45
exerting so much energy to like one person to try to convince them when they
59:53
don't have ears to hear so usually it will not be a long time of going back
1:00:01
and forth in most cases thank you Jesus
1:00:06
Hallelujah well I declare for every single one of you today who has brought prayer requests here who has sickness or

1:01:35
condemning lie of the devil religious lie of the devil that's aimed at its
1:01:41
purpose is to try to keep you stuck and not grow in the Lord and keep feeling
1:01:48
feeling guilty feeling bad if you make a mistake this this uh striving Spirit the
1:01:55
spirit that's saying that you need to be perfect and just this judgmental Spirit

God is intending it for good this is going to be the devil's biggest big big big time regret and mistake in Jesus
1:03:09
name there's a lifting God is bringing through this as what I shared today
1:03:14
actually answering a question there is a lifting coming so that way more people
1:03:20
can come into His Revival and encounter his power encounter his love receive
1:03:26
freedom and healing and salvation this is what God has planned and the devil is
1:03:31
being used as a catalyst of this just like he was in the times of David just
1:03:36
like he was in the times of Joseph just like he was in the times of Jesus when they put him on a cross that was the
1:03:43
Catalyst for us to be saved and for Jesus to be resurrected praise God and so this is
1:03:52
what is happening so I I I I I I pray for your eyes to be opened up more as
1:03:57
Elijah Elisha prayed for his servant for the his eyes to open up to see the army that was with them was so much greater
1:04:04
than the Army coming against them may your eyes open up more so that you can
1:04:09
be stronger spiritually and be as I described as I shared earlier even as I
1:04:15
shared about counting the cost as I shared about the the real godly perspective that through persecution
1:04:22
through attacks from the enemy we really should have joy we really should have peace peace we really should have this
1:04:28
um awareness of like yes of course this is happening this is what I signed up for this is the cost but this is a good
1:04:34
thing this is what's coming then this is what's coming then is the calling for my
1:04:39
life for our life for Revival expanding this is what's coming this is nothing
1:04:44
but a good thing let this Revelation enter your heart more for your own
1:04:50
personal life and for the for the Revival Army for the work of God let
1:04:57
this Revelation increase in your heart so that you can truly be a part of what
1:05:05
the enemy intended for evil God intended for good so that you can actually be
1:05:10
walking in more joy more peace more anointing be lifted spiritually be used
1:05:17
more powerfully for God in Jesus name
