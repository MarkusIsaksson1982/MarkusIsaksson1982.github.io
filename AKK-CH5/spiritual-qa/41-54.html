How many questions is it
0:00
how many questions is it okay to ask God should they all be in our head so the devil doesn't know what we speak now you
0:06
can have intimacy and communication with God in your head absolutely
0:13
but that is to say we shouldn't shy away from the
0:20
greatest the greatest amount of intimacy we can have with God because we're afraid of the devil
0:27
overhearing um you know intimacy with God there H with your intimacy with God
0:35
and your relationship with God it has to be like you feeling the intimacy too you
0:40
know what I mean and so it's not natural to just not talk to
0:46
a friend like with words so um talking to God out loud with words with your own
0:54
words is important and um it's true that the devil can hear words that we speak
1:00
speak but it's so important that you're not being afraid of the devil over
1:06
hearing um really the thing to think about more so is is just using wisdom
1:13
and I'm going to answer this just to summarize kind of like to how to make
1:19
sure you're watching your words carefully um in terms of the devil over hearing uh while being free in your
1:26
relationship with God your intimacy with God this is the way I can summarize it
1:33
be spiritual with God like be
1:38
mature you know um you know your friendship that you
1:43
have with a parent let's say if you if you were to have a friendship with a parent when you're an adult that's a
1:49
mature relationship and that's a relationship that's probably brings the most Joy ever
1:57
at that point in life probably I mean I mean it it just brings blessing and joy
2:02
to the parent as well for there to be this mature relationship you know and so with God it pleases him it Delights him
2:10
for you to have a mature relationship with him um it it it Delights him also
2:16
because it means that you're you're growing you're listening to his word you're taking his word
2:24
seriously and um you are you are in his will and
2:30
walking in victory over the devil and fulfilling your purpose cuz you're growing cuz you're choosing to listen to
2:38
what God's saying and and apply his word and be spiritual so in your relationship with God it's very important for you to
2:43
remember that that part of pleasing God part of touching his heart part of loving him is being mature is is
2:51
choosing to be spiritually mature that's a choice because sometimes there can be
2:56
a temptation to just be like a baby and wine in your father's
3:04
arms but but there comes a point where it's time to grow up so
3:12
um like it's important to always be speaking the words of truth the words of
3:19
Faith the words of life and so to be speaking so much of I feel like the world is crashing down I feel like my my
3:27
life is over I feel like I won't make it go God I I feel like I can't do
3:34
this um this is just upsetting me so much I
3:40
want to give up uh most people when
3:47
they've been receiving the word of God you know when they're not quite
3:53
babies anymore they know that what they're speaking if they're speaking these things is not true it's just emotional
4:00
they know it's not true they know their world is not going to end they know that God's going to come through they know
4:06
that they'll be able to do whatever God's calling them to do Etc they know
4:11
that God's working out all things for the good but it maybe feels better to
4:16
just be like babyish kind of thing um to god it feels good to just roll with the
4:24
emotions for for a moment so when you're talking to God
4:30
like immaturely like when you know it's not even the truth but it's just just being
4:36
emotional um that's where it's it's it's not wise that's where it's I mean it's
4:43
not wise because that's where you should be um concerned about the devil
4:51
hearing right you are showing the devil
4:56
um that you are really weak and that's a choice to be weak or strong right so
5:02
when you to choose to be strong is to speak the truth is to believe and
5:09
Believe In Action uh including prayer time with God
5:15
talking to God that's a choice so you're choosing to be strong and you're showing the devil that I mean the devil seeing
5:20
that they're strong the devil knows they're probably going through through it internally
5:27
emotionally but what they choose to be weak or strong so when you show you are choosing
5:35
to be weak it's like it's like the devil has
5:41
found a weak one that he can focus on attacking
5:46
more and you are showing that the devil is his schemes are like working they're
5:55
working and so it's giving him like Intel like oh this scheme this lie that
6:01
I'm sending in their head is really working perfect I'm going to send more I I'm on to something here is like
6:09
what the devil's thinking right so um that right there what I just
6:16
described is the is the area where you should be thinking oh the devil's listening when you're talking with God
6:24
but the rest of the time you don't need to be thinking the devil's listening be at peace and be at rest
6:31
when you're talking to God you know don't let the devil um ruin your
6:37
intimate time with God so whatever
6:42
you're saying that's as long as it's like in coming from a spiritually mature place in a place of Faith then you don't
6:51
need to be worried concerned afraid that the devil might be hearing what you're
6:58
saying and I think it it's wise even even when
7:03
you're even when things are really tough you're going through it you're going through a trial you're going through an
7:08
attack of the enemy and it's causing you to to cry it's causing you to weep I mean yeah the
7:16
devil sees that and so he can see um oh
7:21
like this is really affecting him or her um so whenever like it's fine to cry
7:27
it's fine you know to have these emotions in these like hard times and
7:33
attacks of the enemy but um it's like you you want to be in this
7:39
position of making God proud and always choosing obedience like the obedience to be to have faith and to choose to be
7:46
strong so like for me if what if I'm ever in this moment of feeling down
7:53
because of attacks of the enemy things that are going on and it's even moving to tear moving moving moving me to tears
8:00
I feel convicted in that moment like I will not be weak not that tears are weak
8:06
but let let me not end here let me not end with tears but let me come to God
8:13
and declare I mean like confess like to God like you're faithful I trust you um
8:21
and and sometimes even it can be a a moment where you're going through
8:27
persecution or you're having Revelation that persecution will
8:33
come uh because of what you've been called to and it can be a a moment of
8:41
like feeling the weight of that and it can be emotional but that's can be a time you that should be a time you're
8:47
convicted to say Lord I will do whatever you you call me to I will go through
8:52
whatever I need to go through I trust you God choosing to
8:58
speak words like this whenever you're having those vulnerable moments emotional moments um so that that that
9:06
really shows because the the devil knows the devil knows that we're not robots the devil knows that things hurt
9:14
us but he doesn't know if we will be weak and weak or strong choose to be
9:20
weak or strong until we until the words come out so okay those there's tears let's
9:28
say but then the words that come out are words of faith and they words showing that you're choosing to be strong and
9:34
trust God and be a warrior then the devil finds that conclusion not the
9:41
conclusion of weakness because of the tears how to not fall into betraying the
9:48
leaders like Judas is the scariot this is a good question
9:56
that maybe a good sermon coming up and then your future let me answer it though in a
10:04
brief way now semi- brief way if I can it's not really ever a brief answer to
10:10
this question but um ultimately what made Judas betray
10:20
Jesus was his love for money over Jesus
10:25
and was his lack of surrender was his allowing allowing like having doors
10:34
open which allowed the enemy to take over which allowed his heart to be full
10:41
of evil he knowingly made that choice it's not like he was forced to
10:48
betray Jesus and it wasn't just overnight that this happened this would
10:54
have been going there would have been these things going on in his heart beforehand so so the devil Roars around
11:01
like a lion seeking whom he can devour and true anointed Ministers of God there
11:08
will always be judices there will be multiple judices there was one Judas among
11:14
12 disciples and so if there are 24 disciples there will be two if there
11:22
generally if there are um if there are thousands of disciples
11:30
there will be you can multiply that number to see how it will be and and and
11:36
and honestly when you're anointed you you should know this you should be prepared for this you should be aware of this so when the day comes you aren't
11:45
taken out by shock and grief but you are prepared and aware and this is something
11:50
I've prepared myself for I've already experience multiple and I I still
11:58
prepare myself self for for that in the future um especially it's it's it's it's
12:04
a very sobering and daunting but daunting with faith in God and trust but
12:12
sobering um reality when you have God's promises over your life when you have
12:18
these prophecies where you know that um as a minister God is calling your
12:24
ministry to grow more as exciting that as that as that is is for the glory of God it's when you
12:33
are mature in the lord it's also sobering in terms of this reality right
12:40
here this is a real thing and um it's the most I I would say
12:47
for I would say it's the most difficult thing about
12:53
Ministry um it's it's it's it's hard but um it's it it happens so it's hard to
13:02
wrap your mind around and um I there's always betrayals in the
13:08
world there's betrayals outside of the church too but I believe at least what I've seen
13:14
what I've seen in my own personal life what I've seen in my spiritual father's testimony and in his life what I've seen
13:20
with other true anointed uh Servants of God
13:25
is that the judices in the church don't compare to the judases of the
13:32
world um because the devil hates Jesus and his work more than he
The devil uses agents
13:40
hates anybody else so therefore hates the anointed Servants of God that carry
13:47
Jesus that influence that reached the whole world to destroy the devil's
13:53
Kingdom and Advance God's kingdom he hates them where than he hates worldly people that aren't doing the work of of
13:58
God and he uses his he uses agents the devil uses agents he uses people
14:05
to be vessels of the devil literally like Judas was a vessel an agent of the
14:14
devil a vessel of the devil is What Judas turned out to be at the end when
14:19
he did his deed that's what he was and that is exactly what happens today and so it's
14:26
um to be an agent of the devil is is pure evil like it's really hard to wrap
14:31
our minds around it when we are children of light and or innocent and we're
14:38
childlike it's really hard to wrap our minds around how a human being can do
14:44
such evil but it's because they're truly an agent of the devil it's going past
14:52
like Temptation and being worldly to like a deeper evil of being being an
14:58
agent of the devil and anything's possible in this place in this place of being an agent of
15:05
the devil a person can make up lies not just one lie but lies out of
15:11
completely thin air and people can do these things for money um people can do these things for
15:20
anything so um you just did it for money
There are Judas
15:27
so this is something sobering for for
15:33
disciples for um those who are serving
15:39
and who are planted and serving in a Ministry it's something sobering that we shouldn't be naive to but spiritually
15:46
mature aware about there are judices among us I hope I'm not I better not I hope I could be
15:54
one not to have um like fear I don't mean to say that
16:00
but I mean if every single person genuine in their heart was like I humble myself and realize
16:08
that um I'm not perfect right
16:14
like I could be a Judas if I'm not careful if we could all humble ourselves in that way then there wouldn't there
16:20
wouldn't be judices so the ones if you were really humbling
16:28
yourself in that way then you won't be a Judas and you don't need to spend your days worrying that you'll be a Judas you
16:34
can um have a Godly confidence about it because that's because you're really
16:40
carrying that fear of God but when one carries pride and they refuse to go there in their heart they refuse to have
16:47
that kind of fear of the Lord and [Music] um they don't fully surrender then there
16:56
is where the judases LIE so they answer to this question have the
17:02
fear of God and and and and and and and make this
17:08
Covenant with God make this Covenant with God lord I never want to and I
17:14
promise that I will never um speak against your true anointed servants I
17:21
will never betray you I won't betray you in your ministry in your work through
17:27
your servants I will not do that I will be slow to
Always hear both sides
17:33
speak um the Bible and also you know the Bible says that it it is wise to always
17:40
hear both sides and the reason of that is is because there is that evil out
17:47
there that just completely makes out lies out of thin air as wild as it is
17:53
for those who are innocent to imagine that that it really does
18:02
happen I mean it was happening in the times of Jesus people were making up stories about him out of thin air people
18:09
were accusing him of all sorts of things people were accusing him of using demonic Powers no evidence completely
18:16
made up out of thin air they didn't see Jesus go to a witch and receive demonic Powers they didn't um witness Jesus
18:23
doing a demonic ritual they didn't see a shred of
18:29
evidence a shred of anything that could make them [Music]
18:34
um like that could validate them from
18:40
speaking this from even speaking this could be happening no they made it up
18:46
out of thin air because of evil in their hearts
18:53
so um as Believers we have to grow up as
18:58
Believers especially where the anointing is because this is where you see evil
19:04
where the anointing is you see evil like never before too like where the true anointing is where God is moving like
19:12
never before you also see the devil like never before and on one hand very
19:17
clearly just like how church without the anointing
19:22
um it's like worship message
19:28
bye [Music] everyone right but like totally
19:34
oblivious to the fact that the devil's real totally oblivious to the fact that demons are literally in people in the
19:40
church sitting beside you inside you perhaps totally oblivious but where the
19:46
anointing is the devil's exposed you literally see evil there
19:55
like coming out of a person's mouth saying this person belongs to me a demon speaking it right
20:02
you see this person I mean you see the demon speaking out of person um I'm
20:08
trying to kill her I want to kill him whatever um you your eyes open you see evil like
20:16
never before but then you see the love of God and the power like never before and you see the victory over the devil
20:23
like never before also where you don't get to see that in a church where anointing is not it's just
20:30
like but not seeing God's love and power uh in in a high level maybe you're
20:39
experiencing it slightly slightly through the word but not to the extent when you see the love
20:45
and power of Jesus destroy the works of the devil set a person free and heal
20:51
them and reveal his love to them tangibly in power with an encounter
20:56
Hallelujah so there's just one example but another example of seeing evil so
21:02
presently where the anointing is is also is is that the devil hates the
21:09
anointing the anointed Ministries and the anointed servants a million times more than he hates the
21:16
Ministries the Servants of God that are not anointed probably more than a million
21:21
times more I mean so therefore the greatest attacks
21:28
will come against the anointed Servants of God and the anointed ministries of
21:34
God so therefore you see the greatest kind of evil uh coming
21:41
towards and and and this can manifest in people making up complete lies and
21:46
getting together and making up complete lies and um yeah it's um it's
Grieving
21:55
very grieving I mean it's grieving when it happened to me and I've experienced just
22:00
grieving I remember sitting down and listening to my spiritual father one day it was like after I had
22:08
gone through such it was after I had gone through intense like
22:14
Judas betrayal stuff for the first time when the ministry was still really
22:19
small and I had visited his church and I was I
22:26
was he I was just sitting being like listening to him being mentored by him at this this one day and he just starts
22:33
to it was beautiful it was like holy spirit wanted to encourage me and strengthen me so he just starts sharing
22:39
with me all of these ways that such evil has been done like
22:45
Judas betrayal lies being made up stuff and it was one of the days I will never
22:52
forget it was like it was such a it was like it it was he it was so encouraging
23:00
but it was also heavy because I wasn't used to
23:06
seeing how intense a devil can attack somebody you know I hadn't because
23:12
without the anointing he doesn't attack that strong
23:18
so I was it was just sobering you know it was it was grieving and and like this is a part of our walk uh is um
23:29
just like our eyes being open up to what true Servants of God have to go
23:36
through the evil that will come their way and that that's part of it that Jesus says uh I was hated and you will
23:43
be hated and expect persecution but blessed are those blessed are you when
23:49
you are persecuted like this is just something that we have to swallow like something that we just have to accept
23:55
that this is part of our walk and it is something I'm just not going to lie it's
24:01
it's definitely not comfortable it's it's grieving it's saddening when it
24:07
happens to you to see members in the body of Christ attack you make up lives about you and then it's like also really
24:15
saddening to see it happen to others you just want
24:20
to like you just want the truth to be known
24:25
you know what I mean so badly and um yeah so this is just part of it this
24:32
is part of it but the good news is that we always have Victory the good news is that God is our Defender it's in his
24:38
timing um but the good news is that the devil can never stop the work of God the work of God will always Prevail the
24:43
devil will try to stop he will try so hard to stop it he will try so hard to discredit uh true anointed ministers he
24:50
will try so hard to discredit um the the the supernatural move of God um this is is even something
24:58
he's trying to do right now he's trying to make people afraid of the the
25:05
supernatural the apostolic and the prophetic move he's trying to make people afraid of it um he's trying to
25:12
put narratives out there to make people just be freaked out and and and
25:19
think that everything's fake and but the devil will never win the devil will never ever ever ever ever win
25:28
Jesus will always win and his true anointed Ministries and servants will
25:34
always Prevail the work will go on and God's
25:40
plans nothing can stop them hallelujah hallelujah so um yeah to to answer I
25:51
mean to finish answering that question how to make sure you're not a
25:56
Judas just must beware how like what is possible for a human to
26:03
do who calls them a Christian when they allow evil to enter their heart when
26:10
they allow jealousy the um betrayals usually the jewi type
26:17
betrayals usually happen um because of a
26:23
person like choosing they don't want to completely surrender
26:28
and therefore they're not getting what what they want they're seeing
26:36
others be blessed they're seeing others be lifted for God's glory
26:43
because they have surrendered to God God lifts The
26:50
Humble but God humbles the proud so the Judas types are always
26:58
those who are not humble are always those who are becoming jealous of others
27:04
around them being blessed by God being lifted by God being used by God it's
27:10
many times others being used by God but yet they aren't seeing growth aren't
27:15
seeing change aren't seeing lifting aren't seeing blessings but it's because they are choosing to to not surrender
27:23
they are choosing to not grow that chal y enters bitterness
27:31
enters offense enters they're not getting what they
27:36
want uh that enters many times it can what what happens is they they
27:43
themselves have um impure motives they want to be they want to have a platform
27:49
they want to be a minister themselves and when they have that you know impure
27:55
motive that they want that with impure reasons not for Pure reasons God's not going to lift them
28:02
that that's not going to happen and so they're not getting what they want and
28:08
um and other others are getting what they wanted for themselves and they become bitter and
28:14
resentful and that's that place that the devil knows here is where I can enter
28:19
bring Temptation and this person can be an agent of the enemy
28:25
so that's the scheme that's the Judas scheme so it's important for you to be aware of that so if you you yourself
28:32
need to be real with yourself are you really surrendering don't be mad at God don't
28:38
be mad at your leader don't be mad at others around you because they're surrendered and they're obeying God and
28:44
you're not be aware with the reality of the situation with the reality of your heart
28:50
with the reality of yourself uh and um you know be aware of
28:55
the scheme be aware of the scheme now that you're aware of the scheme you know if if you ever find this happening
29:02
to yourself like later you know maybe you you in a place of not full surrender
29:09
remember this remember this is the dangerous place where I could become a judice I don't want that to happen I
29:17
Repent Lord I Surrender um part of uh you know part of
29:24
every day having the fear of the Lord is just like your mind your heart is just focused on Lord I want to please you I
29:30
want to obey you I want to please you I want to obey you I want to touch your heart that right there is the the
29:37
greatest advice I can give you to not sin to stay in God's will is is making
29:44
the intention every day to have the fear of the Lord God I want to please you I want to touch your heart I want to obey
29:50
you and nothing else because you choose your like you
29:56
choose your passions like that's God's passion for your life that's what he
30:02
wants for your life he wants you to have the fear of God he wants you to obey him be in his will and touch his heart
30:07
that's what he wants and so 100% that's supposed to be all of our desires and passions but it's up to us to make that
30:13
choice to adopt to receive that passion from God so if you will make that choice then
30:19
you are 100% making that be your number one passion and so if that's your number one
30:25
passion your number one OB objective goal Mission you can't go wrong like if if
30:33
that's the truth if that's really the truth every day you're doing this you're taking this action this intention you
30:39
don't got to worry you don't need to worry about messing up um being a Jud
30:45
becoming a Judas you don't have to worry it's simple it's very simple truly carry
30:50
the fear of God in your heart make the intention to have the fear of God to please God to obey him can we sew for
Sewing for our enemies
30:57
our enemies my son wanted me to sew for his dad's freedom and we did but I wanted to make sure it's okay whenever
31:03
you sew there's a reaping that takes place when you sew into the kingdom of God where anointing is it this is this
31:10
place of receiving more anointing upon your life there's several ways to receive anointing but this is one of the
31:18
ways one of the ways to truly receive more of the anointing and it it's quite
31:25
simple we don't need to it's not really complicated the principle of sewing and reaping um like the
31:33
anointing uh like it's not like when you sew you were just receiving reaping for
31:39
financial blessings only you do but it's not just that it's not just when you sew
31:46
into the anointing you re you're you're reaping more of the anointing of impartation yes you receive that but not
31:53
just that it's really quite simple when there is a need whatever the need is
31:59
whatever the prayer request is and you sew into the true kingdom of
32:05
God where God's anointing is there will be reaping of that
32:10
anointing in your life for that thing that you have swed
32:16
for it's it's quite simple that anointing is going to that area that you
32:22
need when you sew these specific seeds but we ALS have to remember that
32:27
it's not like um like magic or like a a transaction it's not a
32:33
transaction uh we also have to remember that people's Free Will is involved and God's timing is
32:40
involved in this as well so um you know
32:46
just CU we seow it doesn't mean that there's this transaction taking place or something and
32:52
boom then the miracle happens like right away or that is even guaranteed to
32:58
happen um but there is so much power just like we just like prayer just like
33:05
prayer you pray for things but sometimes God's will is something
33:10
different it doesn't mean it was a bad prayer to pray or maybe you're praying healing for someone but it was just
33:17
God's timing for them to go to heaven or maybe you're praying for healing for someone but the healing is
33:24
going to be taking it's just God's will that the healing is going take a lot of time it's going to be extended amount of
33:30
time until the full healing comes but there's there's there's power always in prayer there's power always in
33:37
sewing and so we we believe that there is power in it that there is anointing
33:44
going to that area where we sew always and also God's will is involved in this
33:51
God's timing is involved in this so we invite that we invite God's sovereignty
33:56
into our our prayer our prayers and our
What happens to the Holy Spirit in a Believer
34:06
sewing and there's also power to keep on sewing um like as you're not seeing
34:13
something there's also power to keep on sewing what happens to the holy spirit
34:18
in a Believer after they opened a door to the devil the holy spirit is in and
34:24
your spirit man are one and when you give your life to Jesus
34:30
Holy Spirit just stays there does not leave as when you have given your life
34:36
when you've given your life to Jesus unless you renounce
34:42
Jesus uh Holy Spirit stays stays one with your spirit man and the God wants
34:52
you to invite the Holy Spirit to invade every part of your life to to invade
34:57
your soul to invade your body your flesh and the more you fan into flame
35:06
your spirit the Holy Spirit the more you seek God the more you obey God and do
35:15
the spiritual things he's telling you to do instead of the carnal things living spiritually instead of carnally the more
35:21
you do these things the more the Holy Spirit overtakes your life every part of your life
35:27
but when one opens up a door to the devil that's the opposite of inviting
35:34
the Holy Spirit to take over more um and and and and it's it's you
35:42
generally in the soul realm where a a demon enters and is
35:47
allowed so instead of inviting the Holy Spirit to overtake in the soul realm
35:52
you've done the opposite and you've opened a door for a demon to come in in and the opposite kind of spirit instead
36:00
of Holy Spirit demonic spirit is now taking place residing in the
36:06
soul the area of the soul but the holy spirit's still there the holy spirit's still one with your spirit but what it's
36:13
what's been done is it's just been quenched it's been um pushed down
36:20
more so now you're carnal man like what you were before Holy Spirit came in your
36:26
life is started to change you the carnal Man rises and the Holy Spirit is stifled
36:33
when one opens up a door to the demon so when one opens up a door to a demon and Demon comes in what's urgent is to seek
36:41
God to seek God where his anointing is to get free of that demon and invite
36:48
Holy Spirit to fill you to overtake these areas where the demon was and to
36:55
overtake more than ever before and seek God like never before so Holy Spirit can now take over
37:02
every part of your life so now holy spirit the your spirit man is so
37:07
strengthened by the holy spirit that there is such little Temptation now
37:14
there's no temptation to even open up doors to Demons because you've become so spiritual that you are not enticed to do
37:22
things of the flesh you're not enticed to open a door to a
37:28
demon if I tested positive for something like covid how should I tell my employer without speaking death so it's okay for
If I tested positive for Covid how should I tell my employer
37:37
you to speak the reality of the the test
37:43
results what the doctor says it's okay for you to say the test says
37:50
this what's not okay is to accept it I mean what's not okay spiritually is to
37:56
AC accept it in your heart what you should do whether it's a
38:01
doctor telling you this is the diagnosis this is what we see in the X-ray um this
38:08
is what the test results show what you should do is see this is
38:14
what this test says this is what the doctor says it's true it's true with I'm
38:21
not hard I didn't just hear out of thin air the doctor did say this this is what
38:26
the doctor says this is what the test results yeah this is what it says that's totally fine you can say that for sure
38:35
but Jesus says something different and and so what's important for is for you to know that in your heart test results
38:42
says this doctor says this but Jesus says something different Jesus says I am healed and I can choose to accept in my
38:49
heart what this test result really says what the doctor truly says or I can
38:55
accept in my heart heart what Jesus says I can accept in my heart what Jesus has done for me I can accept the spiritual
39:02
reality the spiritual reality is greater than the physical reality so we can say
39:08
yeah I mean we we shouldn't be um we we we we we got to be careful
39:15
actually that we're not too um what's the
39:21
word we come off as like weird Christians like like to the world like
39:28
yeah yes this is what the doctor says yes this is instead of like the doctor didn't say this um the test result it
39:35
doesn't say that but it clearly says this no it doesn't say that no like yes
39:41
like we we have to reach the people in the world let's not be um like weird spiritually I don't know
39:48
the right word to say this right now but I think you know what I'm trying to say because it's not we're not doing the
39:54
wrong thing by saying yes this is what the world says this is what the doctor says this is what the report says that's not wrong that's the physical reality or
40:03
worldly reality or test result reality doctor reality that is the reality their reality but this we know in our hearts
40:10
the spiritual reality is stronger is is more real than the physical reality than
40:18
the doctor reality like that's their truth I accept that that's their truth
40:24
but my truth is something different my truth is that I am healed by Jesus's
40:30
Stripes yeah and so um you know even
40:36
it's a reality that sometimes we have an injury an injury happen yeah you you
40:42
feel the pain you you experience the twisting of the ligament the you you you you you you
40:49
know it that that really happened yep I hurt my arm I hurt my back I hurt my leg
40:57
yeah that's a reality but you know I am healed so though this happened to me
41:02
though I'm experiencing the feeling of pain right now though it is swelled up
41:08
it's physically swelled but I am healed I declare this swelling must go this
41:14
pain must go this sickness must go and I am healed by Jesus's Stripes I am healed
41:20
I receive my inheritance of healing now my spiritual reality that's my truth the spiritual
41:27
reality is my truth not the physical reality that I do indeed feel I do indeed see and I and I experienced it
41:34
the fall or whatever I but I accept the spiritual truth that I am healed okay so you don't
41:41
need to worry like oh no I said that I got hurt I said that I have a cold I
41:47
said that um I have tested positive for covid oh no now I'm accepted the
41:53
sickness no it doesn't work that way way it's about your heart and the actions
41:59
you take uh spiritually to reject it and
42:05
to I mean rejecting it is acknowledging that that it is an attack that has come you know you know when you're saying the
42:12
doctor report says this or whatever it's like the weapons have formed yeah the
42:18
weapons have formed but then in your own spiritual life and it doesn't have to be in front of the people you don't have to
42:23
be like I'm tested co co I'm tested positive for covid but I don't accept it
42:29
I am healed by jus Stripes like you don't have to do that like in front of the person like you can do it in your own
42:35
time make take that action in the spiritual realm and reject it and accept it accept the in inheritance of
42:42
healing and do it quickly too do it quickly like you get the doctor's report and then like as soon as you can after I
42:50
mean as soon as you get the doctor's report don't even accept it in your heart immediately immediately just don't
42:55
make that choice like inside to not accept and then as soon as you leave the doctor like the
43:01
first moment you can say I don't receive it I reject it but now when you're with um when
43:08
you're walking in wisdom and you're with fellow Believers you can say yes I have
43:13
this uh this sickness this injury but I know I am healed by jesus' Stripes you
43:20
know you can definitely talk spiritually with those around you who are spiritual
43:27
because that can even be a testimony to them like that can even be an iron
43:32
sharpening iron moment for that friend that person to hear how you're responding in the face of this
43:40
attack so I don't mean that it like has to be private I'm just saying walk in wisdom and you don't need to um worry
43:49
about saying what the doctor said or what the um test
Is it possible to have an ungodly soul tie
43:55
says is it possible to have an ungodly Soul tie with another Christian
44:01
absolutely absolutely I mean
44:06
um for one there's some types of relationships that God's not calling us to so it doesn't even mean that a person
44:13
has to be like really sinful while a Christian it can just
44:18
simply be God wasn't calling you to that relationship and it could be a unhealthy
44:26
uh suai but um there are I mean so many
44:32
people call themselves a Christian but they aren't fully surrendered some of them when we're
44:37
talking about romantic relationships some of them aren't ready to be in a romantic relationship yet and
44:43
they they God needs to do more work on them they need to do more work on their
44:49
character and so they could be a great person with a great heart but they're
44:55
just not spiritually mature enough ready to be in this Rel uh um romantic
45:03
relationship yet so that can be the case sometimes and a lot of times also there
45:11
are Christians in ungodly relationships because a person um carries manipulation
45:18
in them in themselves that's something that they have not surrendered to God yet repented of been transformed and and
45:26
they carry manipulation the big area of um ungodly soul ties many times is
45:37
manipulation and and a lot of Christians carry that manipulation when they aren't
45:43
surrendered when they haven't worked on their character when they haven't repented and been transformed in that
45:50
area so that is a big area a lot of people people find
45:56
themselves in as Christians is in a manipulative relationship which is a
46:03
whenever it's a MIP relationship pretty much it's always a a soul tie an ungodly
46:10
Soul demonic Soul tie uh and and you'll notice that because you'll notice like
46:15
how you're controlled by that person pretty much like maybe you sense how you don't fear
46:22
man any other time but you do with that person and you're like it's weird it's like I'm different when I'm around that
46:28
person and you care so much about what they think and you find yourself compromising
46:34
yourself um just CU you fear them just because you care what they think so much but it's just that person the rest of
46:40
the time you're not like that with anybody else that's an indication that it's a demonic Soul tie and it's
46:47
manipulation that has formed that demonic Soul tie and by you giving into
46:53
the manipulation so to be free of that
How to be free of an ungodly soul tie
46:58
demonic Soul tie renounce that demonic Soul tie position yourself where the anointing is Flowing to destroy that
47:05
yoke like coming to the church like coming to fful church for example or coming onl on the lives watching replays
47:12
that's where anointing is Flowing you'll be free as you renounce this and any other ties sometimes people give jewelry
47:19
rings in in in romantic relationships for example or other relationships that
47:25
carries demonic Spirit attached to that uh specifically in the area of the Demonic Soul
47:31
tie and and and honestly Believers need to really be aware of this that I mean
47:36
going back to Judas going back to Judas um we need to not be naive and we need to realize that
47:45
there are people who call themselves Believers but are not
47:50
surrendered and have allowed the enemy in their I mean to influence them many
47:57
times it can be through manipulation they will pray on Christians I mean they
48:03
can call themselves Christians they can even think that they are Christians but they carry this evil
48:11
motive in their heart um of wanting to manipulate people to get their
48:17
way so they can pray on Believers because they know Believers are so
48:24
loving and think the best of
48:31
people and we know we are called
48:36
to to give to the poor and we are called to
48:41
um give our enemies the shirt a shirt on our back like we we are called to to
48:48
live this way and sacrifice ourselves but God doesn't call us to do that in
48:54
the face of manipulation he calls us to do that with wisdom he
48:59
calls us to do these things with wisdom when he's truly calling us to do that but not
49:05
to when you're doing it through manipulation it's like you're giving it it's not helping a person you
49:12
know when you are when they're like I'm going to do this I'm going to do this so that they
49:18
can give this to me like you giving it to them isn't isn't isn't helping it's
49:24
not it's not really helping the person it's enabling the person many times so that is a situation of Still
49:31
Loving them but having boundaries still showing them love but but having
49:37
boundaries so be we need to be aware of that that there will
49:42
be there will be there will be people who who are not surrendered that are out
49:48
to manipulate innocent Believers fighting in Jesus
No middleman between us and God
49:56
people take things out of context so much and um there is
50:03
no middleman between us and
50:10
God there's no middleman needed to have intimacy with
50:16
God and relationship with God none at
50:22
all Jesus tore the veil so we could have intimacy and relationship with God with
50:28
no middleman with no having to go to a priest like what it used to be or going
50:33
to a prophet or anything however God still uses
50:40
vessels God still speaks through vessels and God so God speaks to us
50:46
individually just without vessels but God also chooses to speak to us through vessels and there's like every single
50:53
person on this Earth there isn't is anyone that's immune to that where
50:59
like God will choose to not like like no vessel God will never speak through them
51:05
it's just them and God no I mean this is just God's ways that he speaks to us
51:12
different ways he speaks to us just Holy Spirit to us to our spirit he speaks to us through the
51:17
word as we're reading the word but he also speaks to us through vessels and so
51:23
there's sometimes we can be praying to God for an answer uh but God chooses to
51:28
to answer specifically through a vessel so in that case one could call that a
51:35
middleman in that regard but it doesn't mean it's a middleman of having intimacy
51:42
relationship with God salvation with God at all and that is um that's Foundation
51:49
that's a foundational belief among every believer among me among my spiritual
51:54
father how to not allow family to manipulate man manipulate you and still be
52:01
loving uh you have to understand that to put boundaries down and to not allow
52:07
someone to manipulate you isn't being unloving so you just have to get that in
52:13
your mind you just have to understand that um
52:19
and you also have to understand that people who want to manipulate they
52:26
they're manipulating to get their way what they want if someone's manipulating it's like they want their way what they
52:33
want to get through the manipulation more than anything like that's like the biggest thing they
52:39
want right that's why they're doing this that's why they're doing this like wrong thing so when you don't allow them to
52:47
manipulate you then they're not getting what they want so that's not going to make them
52:53
happy you know um and if if a person is a manipulative
53:01
person then they're going to respond with more manipulation they're going to
53:08
manip try to manipulate when the manipulation in that area is not working they will then try to manipulate through
53:13
trying to make you feel bad making you feel like you're not being loving um so you got to be aware of that you
53:20
got to be aware of that scheme and you have to knew your mind and
53:27
remember I am being loving right now you know I'm not being not loving I'm
53:33
obeying God right now and that's all that matters and I won't let the enemy
53:39
lie to me I won't allow the enemy to lie to
Boundaries
53:45
me so um you don't need to feel like how do I
53:53
show them I'm loving though when I when I say no like just well I mean what's
53:59
important to do is to not like be angry you're manipulating me but just be firm
54:06
just put boundaries down and just be simple in that in that way and then
54:13
continue to show them love in a way that maintains the boundaries you know speak with love love
54:20
in action in other ways have you always had good boundaries
54:25
taught by family or have you learned in Your Surrender call I've learned in my surrender call mostly and especially
54:30
through my spiritual father he has so much wisdom and my spiritual father Prophet Dr Jord Davy so much wisdom
54:37
especially in that area I mean having boundaries is such an important part of being an anointed servant of God it's so
54:43
important I mean Jesus had boundaries that was such an important part of his ministry was like having boundaries like
54:49
he only kept 12 close and then three very close and he was consistent with
54:55
that so he was really walking in this mature way of keeping boundaries
55:01
consistently so that he would be able to do exactly and all that God had called
55:07
him to do because that's why we need boundaries so that we are not drained so
55:13
that we are protecting the anointing in us so we are
55:18
protecting the the goods in us the anointing in us uh uh
55:25
that God needs to release okay so I have to make sure I'm protecting the anointing and I'm also protecting my
55:32
peace and my joy so that I can come on here and I can have energy and I can
55:38
have so much joy to pour out to you all and I can have so because I have peace I
55:44
can pour out more love if I didn't have as much peace it's not that I would Don't Love don't love you but the love
55:54
can't come out as much because there's too much going on
56:00
there's too much there just tired drained right so I have to make sure I
56:05
protect my peace my joy the anointing I have to make sure I'm not being drained I have to make sure my mind is
56:13
focused on Jesus and whatever is good admirable worthy of Praise lovely um
56:19
instead of too much negative or that will cause me to be drained will cause me to not have as much peace which will
56:25
then cause me to not pour out as much love and will cause the anointing to not
56:30
grow as much as God wants it to and keep pouring out um so that's an area of
56:37
boundaries too um I mean like that's why a big that's
56:42
why we have to keep boundaries so um so yeah my spiritual
Spiritual Father
56:48
father has has um just gotten so much
56:54
wisdom and in this area from him walking in Ministry and also being a prophet and seeing and so he has really helped
57:02
me like like people in my life people in Ministry like many years
57:08
ago just the prophetic directions helped me so much
57:14
just um true motives being revealed in people that I didn't really realize and
57:21
so because of that I was saved from being the anointing being drained by
57:26
these by by these like wise boundaries that I was led to put up by God by um
57:35
the the wisdom coming from my spiritual father Prophet Dr J Davey and um as you
57:41
you know just like what I was began to speak on in the beginning of the message the more you grow in the
57:47
anointing the more you see the potential the capability of evil that a person can
57:53
do like Jud so
57:58
um my eyes opened up you know the the capabilities that that that Christ some
58:04
Christians can have so that really leads you to walk in such
58:10
wisdom um of of who to keep close I've heard the term spiritual
58:15
grandfather is your spiritual father our grandfather well there's actually technically like the technical term in
58:20
the spiritual realm of spiritual grandfather actually doesn't exist just because
58:25
the spirit doesn't go get old like having to do it in that way our the
58:31
spirit does not ever grow old our body grows old but the spirit does
58:37
not yeah so it's like um our family in Christ and our fellow uh like Servants
58:45
of God it's like in the spiritual realm We're All
58:51
Youthful We're All Youthful so it's different that than how it is in the the
58:57
Physical Realm how do we love people and protect our hearts at the same
59:03
time this is a this is a good one how do we love people and protect our hearts at the same time so
59:13
um there will be there will be people that God reveals to you that it
59:23
will be like a covenant um relationship there will
59:28
be uh like jeanal I know she will be with me till the
59:38
end I I know I know that that there's a spiritual Covenant there um there's
59:45
certain relationships my spiritual father I know
59:50
I will he will always be my spiritual father always I know that God God has called these relationships in my life to
59:58
be there for life I know it with all my heart this is
1:00:04
and this is all having to do with God's plan and God's purpose um God's work and that's why
1:00:11
there's this guarantee that's why there's these blessings of these relationships it's all having to do with
1:00:16
God's plan um and and the reason why they will be there for life is because God needs
1:00:23
that or his plan and that has been made clear to me by God um so there's certain relationships
1:00:31
where you don't have to like worry about protecting your heart where God will
1:00:38
lead you in that but then there can be some relationships there's a lot of relationships that will be seasonal and
1:00:44
that's totally okay and God doesn't want you to um hold a person too tightly like
1:00:52
make them your God or make them or not even just make them their your God but like not give them to God right
1:01:00
like all the blessings that God's giving you I mean everything God's giving you
1:01:06
you should give to God you shouldn't hold them too tightly that you don't trust God with them and you don't surrender them to God and so you got to
1:01:13
be real with yourself that there will be relationships that are just going to be
1:01:19
seasonal and it's just cuz God wants it that way it sometimes it's because your
1:01:26
calling is is higher than another person's and that person can't go with
1:01:32
you they're not meant to go with you in that next season right or maybe a person
1:01:41
isn't as equally yolked to you like they're not fully surrendered and but
1:01:46
you can love that person so much and be so close to that person and you don't you don't want to
1:01:53
let them go but but God's saying you have to let them go for your purpose to be fulfilled but you like really love
1:02:00
them and want to stay really close but God's asking you to not but it's for the best you know and
1:02:07
so you got to be real with the relationships in your life that you're not that God hasn't confirmed to you
1:02:13
like what I was talking about the ones that like God's really confirmed you got to be real with yourself like these
1:02:19
relationships God hasn't like confirmed that they're lifelong close relationships that for
1:02:26
God's purpose be real with yourself be real with God surrender them to
1:02:31
God and that's all you have to do I mean in terms of like protecting your heart I
1:02:36
mean like you you surrender surrender surrendering your relationship to God is how you protect your heart so you
1:02:44
understand I surrendered everything so I'm going to be okay and content with whatever comes with whatever season
1:02:51
comes you know if God has me moving someplace else and that means that I'm not going to be in close relationships
1:02:56
with them anymore as much sometimes that's the reason or sometimes you're just as close you're
1:03:01
you're online and on the phone but but sometimes that will lead
1:03:06
to other friendships not being as close because you God need has other people in the place he's moving you to for example
1:03:13
that he needs you to be close to for his purpose I'm okay with whatever new
1:03:19
season God takes me in different direction I'm okay with it just have that in your heart talk to God about it
1:03:25
surrender and that's all you need to do to protect your heart you don't need to like worry or have walls up and
1:03:32
everything um I mean have healthy boundaries have healthy boundaries but
1:03:37
don't don't live in this hurt place like this rejection place this orphan
1:03:43
abandonment place of not opening up to friend in
1:03:49
friendships that God's calling you to open up to because you have you're afraid you got to let that go you got to surrender that to God you got to be free
1:03:55
of all of that um so that you can pour out love sometimes God wants you to pour
1:04:01
out so much love to a person in a season but it's just for a season but that's your
1:04:06
assignment some that's how it is sometimes so that's okay and you have to trust God that if
1:04:14
if one relationship is ending God has a better one in store like a like if you
1:04:21
were so blessed by a relationship and you know it's then God's calling this to end God's going to bless you even more
1:04:28
in the next relationship and not just a blessing but uh it's for the Kingdom so
1:04:35
I mean God's kingdom is going to advance more through you and through this other person in general because you're friends
1:04:42
because you're are working together for the kingdom I want to answer a question about um not seeing healing immediately
1:04:50
yet so it's very important to understand like when you are where the anointing is
1:04:55
and when you have really applied all of like serious
1:05:00
like you're surrendered and you really applied all of the principles of how to receive Deliverance
1:05:06
healing completely and also maintaining freedom and healing like when you can be
1:05:11
confident that you are surrendered and you're applying all of these principles and um and you've experienced
1:05:20
freedom but you're still waiting on some others it's important for you to
1:05:25
understand this this truth right here that God chooses sometimes for
1:05:32
healing to take place over time he has different purposes for this
1:05:37
different reasons but this is just the truth and sometimes we can forget that
1:05:43
sometimes we can think maybe I'm not doing something right but we have to remember this
1:05:50
truth and we we have to accept it we have have to
1:05:55
accept God is choosing and and if you're seeing this take place in yourself you will know okay God is choosing for this
1:06:02
to take place over time and I must choose to be content with that and I
1:06:07
must continue to do all that he's commanded me to do I must continue to apply all these principles and I must
1:06:14
continue to believe with all of my heart that I will see complete healing because
1:06:20
I am already healed because Jesus loves me so much and he paid the price for this and I believe in the power of the
1:06:26
anointing that I've already seen so much transformation from in my life and freedom from I believe so I will choose
1:06:34
to believe every day that I will see it manifest completely there's a story where of the Bible it says that the
1:06:41
people with Leprosy they came to Jesus it says on their way to the priests they were healed they were not healed
1:06:46
immediately that's that's one of our big examples in the Bible of of a time when Jesus just chose for the healing to not
1:06:53
take Place immediately there's different purposes that God has for this um we don't always
1:06:59
have to understand them sometimes God will give us understanding uh
1:07:05
sometimes sometimes the reason can be is that God knows I've heard many testimonies actually I've heard
1:07:10
testimonies at fful church I think some of you watching even have shared this testimony that God it God took a while I
1:07:17
think one person it was like almost a year to see full Deliverance for nine months
1:07:22
and they realized themselves that if God hadn't taken time
1:07:28
like gone slowly with their full healing that they would have not come back to church and
1:07:36
they probably would have gone back to their old ways and they literally thanked God for
1:07:45
not delivering them immediately I I've seen one I think one
1:07:51
of you here shared this testimony and I've seen these testimonies veral of them that they actually recognized it
1:07:56
and so that's a big reason why um sometimes God delays the healing is
1:08:04
because God he sees the future even when you don't see the future he he sees what you don't see and
1:08:10
he sees that if he just did quick healing boom before there was transformation in your heart in one's
1:08:17
heart that there wouldn't be enough strength in you you would end up just
1:08:25
going back to life as as usual or you wouldn't take it as seriously seeking
1:08:32
god um so that sometimes is a reason the big a big reason why it's it's having to
1:08:39
do with God knows more than we know and um this continuing to seek Him and
1:08:47
honestly giving you a big reason to keep seeking him like I need Deliverance
1:08:54
still is God's using that to transform you to keep you safe to keep you out of
1:09:00
the world to keep you from opening up doors and God knows more than we do we
1:09:06
can be like no what if God delivered me from everything right now immediately
1:09:11
there's no way I would go but I would go back and but God knows God knows better God
1:09:19
knows us better and we are truly really in invulnerable place when our hearts
1:09:25
haven't yet been transformed yet cuz that takes time and so when someone has like if
1:09:32
someone's you know pretty carnal in the soul hasn't been transformed by God much in the soul
1:09:39
and they have tons of bondage and for God to free them completely they are in
1:09:45
a vulnerable place remember the Bible says how when one demon goes he wants to bring more back with them like they're
1:09:51
in a vulnerable place and it's it's not every situation that it's like a
1:09:57
dangerous person it's not like it's a dangerous place all the time but I mean many times a person can be completely in
1:10:04
the world can be can can can come to Jesus God can deliver them completely they surrender everything and they're on
1:10:11
fire they fill themselves with the Holy Spirit they transform day by day it's a quick transformation even and they're
1:10:17
they're safe they're protected that yeah many times but sometimes not sometimes it's God just knows the person God knows
1:10:25
that this will put them in a very vulnerable even dangerous spiritually position so instead we'll do it
1:10:33
gradually and then sometimes we'll heal them of a lot of things but then the
1:10:38
other things you're not seeing complete healing yet and but God knows what he's doing God knows what he's doing so trust
1:10:45
him and surrender everything surrender
1:10:50
everything everything and take be be so serious about following God and all of
1:10:56
his principles and I declare
1:11:01
