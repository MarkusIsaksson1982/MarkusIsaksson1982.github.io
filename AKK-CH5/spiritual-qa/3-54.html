Can we be sure of our salvation if we struggle with an addiction to nicotine?
0:00
can we be sure of our salvation if we have a struggle with addiction to nicotine um Jesus isn't expecting you it
0:07
doesn't say you have to be perfect to be saved um so that's it doesn't really
0:13
correspond um the question uh it'd be different if you
0:21
were like choosing choosing to live a sinful way but if you
0:26
are if you haven't if you've been battling and haven't been able to find freedom yet you don't need to be
0:32
worrying if you're saved because that would you got to understand God's love
0:37
and grace that doesn't make sense you know for him to banish you to he hell
0:44
just because you're having a struggle you know that's not God god is so full of love more than any person on this
0:51
earth so you can just have that wisdom if you can know God's love you you won't have
0:58
that question in your mind um but this power of God that is moving here is
1:05
delivering people always of addiction so if you can really make the choice that you don't want to indulge in jug drugs
1:14
anymore and you really be serious about rejecting the enemy's lies and renouncing and believing choosing to
1:20
believe that God will give you the power to resist temp the temptation I guarantee I promise you will be free and
1:26
you'll be free fast because I know the power of this anointing I know the power of of Jesus his power is so great so
1:36
really believe lift your faith and you can be free right now today you don't have to to struggle you
1:44
don't have to think it's this struggle jesus will free you
What to do while waiting on the full manifestation of healing from God?
1:50
completely what to do in terms of healing while waiting on the full manifestation of healing from God what's
1:55
really important is to believe that you've been healed and especially if you've experienced healing before the
2:02
enemy can never take it if you don't allow him he will lie and say you're not
2:08
really healed you you aren't really healed still he will lie he will do that
2:13
so you have to value what you've received if you've experienced receiving healing before if you've seen a miracle
2:20
take place that really took place and if the enemy tries to bring symptoms back
2:27
if the enemy tries to um make it seem like you you lost the healing you
2:34
weren't really healed you have to know that he's a liar and that he will attempt that many times and so you you
2:41
can't go back to a place of "Oh I guess I need healing again." You have to say "I received my healing." Because you
2:48
have to value what you have already received you can't disvalue what you've received and then um just keep asking
2:56
for it again and again you know you have to value what you have received so that what has already been given to you can
3:05
fully manifest and stay in your life so it's very important you value what you
3:12
have received and reject every lie of the enemy that is saying otherwise
3:17
anytime that it seems the enemy is bringing symptoms back of how it used to
3:22
be you have to go in the spirit and say "I reject you i reject these lies i am
3:29
healed god has healed me i value what he has done and you cannot steal it and God
3:34
will be glorified through this." We also have the responsibility of being good
3:40
testimonies of what God has done we have that responsibility to hang on to our
3:46
miracles to to take it seriously the valuing
3:52
because we the miracles that God gives us we are to be stewards
3:57
of you know so the so the miracle is not just about us the miracle is not about
4:03
us getting to receive this healing the miracle is for us to be a testimony to
4:08
what Jesus can do so it's so important that we really value what God has done
4:15
for us not just cuz that's how you keep it yourself but
4:20
that's how God has glorified the most and people can really see the testimony
4:25
of Jesus in our lives the testimony of a like abundant life that God has given us
4:31
all that he that he has for us all I should say abundant life that he has for us
4:36
all it's up to us to receive it and value it and keep it and and then be
4:45
someone that God can entrust with even more and even more and even more by valuing what he's given us and by
4:51
surrendering and being selfless and choosing to grow up and not listen to the enemy's lies
4:58
so as we do as we do this as we exhibit that maturity as
5:04
we as we exhibit that wisdom of you know
5:09
using what we have received that the the schemes of the devil that's been revealed to us and now we use what we've
5:16
learned and we walk in our authority and we don't let the enemy lie to us anymore we grow up we be strong when we do that
5:24
God sees he can entrust us with more he can entrust with us with more anointing more responsibility more blessings to pour on
5:32
our lives to then be good stewards of those blessings and all of that contributes to more and more abundant
5:38
life all of that contributes to more and more heaven on earth in our lives all of
5:44
that contributes to being brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter for Jesus so that's the big
5:51
picture you know and so really it it all like to receive miracles and to see them
5:58
fully manifest and to to keep them if the devil's trying to take
6:03
them what can give you the most power to be able to do that to keep the miracles
6:08
to see the miracles to keep the miracles to go glory to glory is to focus on your
6:14
love for Jesus to focus on the fact that all of this is about obedience to
6:22
God that's you know it's very simple if you keep your eyes simply on obeying God
6:27
so like what you're learning what you're learning at church for example the principles you're learning the schemes
6:32
of the enemy that you're learning the equipping that you're learning of how to have victory over the enemy all of that
6:38
that you're learning God is saying to you I'm teaching you this for you to apply in your life for you to have
6:45
victory over the enemy for God to be glorified more in your life for God to
6:51
be able to pour more anointing upon you is now you're not constantly being beaten up by the
6:58
enemy but you're standing strong and you can be a vessel to help other
7:04
people it's all about obedience to God love for God and so that's where the power is like that's because if you f if
7:12
you're focusing on other things like I want the miracle I want to be healed but you're not focused on your
7:20
love for God like obeying God then you won't have the power to to keep to receive the
7:27
miracle to keep the miracle so you know I found in my life as I've been sharing
7:33
the simplicity of God's ways like I found in my life just like having that simple heart
7:40
that simple mind I must be in God's will i must please
7:45
him when I speak I want it to be words that please him i don't want to speak
7:51
negative words that would be babyish i don't want to speak words that are out
7:57
of his will every word I speak I want it to be pleasing to him the meditations on my
8:03
heart I want it to be pleasing to him so if I start thinking negatively I'm gonna catch myself and start thanking God
8:11
praising God confessing the opposite of the negative thoughts in the mind and
8:17
speaking the truth you know just simple things like
8:22
simple things like that that simple kind of obedience of your day-to-day your meditations in your heart your words
8:30
just that you speak all of that being about obedience to God everything follows
8:37
that everything follows that like like as you do that the doors are
8:44
automatically being shut to the enemy as you do that you're automatically
8:49
receiving miracles in your life and I've seen like me personally it just
8:55
it's like every day it's just like a supernatural life like it's it's never a time where I'm like so
9:03
frustrated by the enemy and it's like "Oh what do I do the
9:08
enemy's come in this way so hugely and
9:14
this is horrible." like just just every day like for me personally every day I found it's
9:20
just the grace of God the favor of God the miraculous power of God at work in
9:26
my life and so much peace so much
9:32
joy and of course there's days where there's you feel
9:40
the the discomfort and a little bit of pain of the waiting of the sacrifice
9:48
that comes with the picking up your cross the sacrifice that comes with obving God there are days like that but
9:55
they are few and the peace and joy is still there amidst that
10:01
discomfort so it's not even considered a bad day you know
10:07
um but yeah like every day I just and I and I I I know I'm kind of sharing a
10:12
little bit of what I've been sharing a lot lately but it's really like um I really see God speaking so much and
10:19
I've been getting so much revelation so much lately about this is the true
10:24
simplicity of following God when his power is really available when you're really planted at a church where God's
10:30
power is it's so simple it's so simple it comes down to
10:37
surrender to God and obedience to him and then he just takes care of
10:45
everything everything else takes care of itself the doors are shut to the enemy
10:50
miracles flow in your life you go glory to glory you're divinely set up for
10:57
God's perfect will just by surren of surrender and
11:03
really being after his heart genuinely being after his heart genu genuinely wanting to please
11:10
him every day and if you have a day where you're not doing that that you catch yourself
11:17
and you apologize you don't condemn yourself you apologize and you ask God to help you
11:22
get on track again and be after his heart really every day
11:29
amen how do you deal with loneliness um okay first of all the joy of the Lord
How do you deal with loneliness?
11:36
is your strength so the first key is to really be in relationship with God and
11:42
when you're really in relationship with God you will not be lonely you may have times where you feel lonely but it won't
11:49
be like this excruciating painful
11:54
loneliness that leads to like depression like people without Jesus or people that aren't truly
12:01
um surrendering everything to Jesus and allowing him to fill that hole fill every
12:07
hole loneliness will usually lead to depression it will lead to um being so
12:12
discontent it can lead to thoughts of death negative thoughts
12:18
thoughts of unworthiness so much thinking about rejection that you're not good enough and just a dark place like
12:26
without Jesus filling the void that's what will happen for most people if they um are experiencing loneliness or
12:34
experiencing not having many friends or any friends in their life and they
12:40
listen to that voice that will usually lead there but when you can surrender everything to Jesus and really allow him
12:47
to fill every void as I said you may feel lonely from
12:52
time to time but it won't be overtaking you to a place of loneliness
13:00
um and so it's very important that you first of all make Jesus your everything
13:07
and your best friend your father and your Lord and your best friend it's very
13:14
important you renew your mind regularly that Jesus is always with you
13:21
and just be con choose to accept his way of comm communication choose his way
13:29
choose choose to accept that he doesn't speak in the way that we would probably prefer
13:35
like audible voice um and like to see him physically
13:43
as a like a physical person you know choose to just accept that and be okay
13:48
with that rather than like longing like like just constantly longing
13:54
for that relationship in a friend when Jesus is not going to come in that way
14:00
by and large you know like choosing to be content in that choose choose to accept Jesus for who he
14:06
is that's something powerful wow choose to accept Jesus for who he is and for how he chooses to speak to you
14:15
and like a big way that God is going to speak to you the biggest ways is through his word through the Bible and through
14:22
the teachings of the leader God has anointed you to receive from
14:28
so sometimes a word will come forth through a teaching for example that
14:34
really touches your heart that really makes you feel God's love that really brings
14:39
peace and so you need to renew your mind that's Jesus speaking that's Jesus
14:45
speaking to you that's him pouring his love out on you that's intimacy with
14:51
Jesus you know it's just it's the it's it's God using a vessel to speak but it
14:57
was really him speaking to you and so if you can choose to value God's voice
15:05
and feel his love through him really speaking on a regular
15:11
basis that that hole will be filled and there are seasons for most
15:19
everyone that God will take you through a time where you don't have as many or
15:24
maybe any close friends and sometimes that's that God is you're
15:31
realizing all the friends you had are open doors to the enemy and aren't surrendered to God and aren't healthy
15:36
for you and so maybe that's the reason it happened or maybe it's just a different season where it's just not
15:41
happening don't take that as rejection don't take that as something's wrong with you sometimes that is God leading
15:48
you there so that you can turn to him and allow him to fill every void and be
15:54
your best friend and help get you to that place of
16:00
surrender sometimes that's his kindness to help you come to that place of
16:06
seeking him fully and surrendering everything so
16:11
um you know God wants for us to have community but there's some seasons
16:19
where it might not be there and it it doesn't and God wants it that way cuz he wants you to learn how learn for you to
16:27
allow him to fill every void but when God does bring community and maybe it's even just one person
16:34
value that value that gift of the friend that he's given you we many times think
16:40
we need way more friends than we need we really don't i mean we really don't need we don't
16:48
need tons of people to make us feel special or something we
16:54
really don't need that we think we do but many times when you're thinking that it's that you're not allowing God to
17:01
fill that void allow him to fill that void and the
17:06
one person or two people or three or four or however many people whom he's
17:12
put in your life that love you maybe that's just a parent maybe that's just a
17:17
child maybe that's just your spouse maybe that's just one friend maybe it's
17:22
just like one person who you feel is like like genuinely loves you and you
17:28
love them value that and see what a gift that that one
17:35
person is that God has given you and that you are so blessed you're so blessed and you don't
17:41
want for you don't want for anything amen
17:47
um but yeah I mean I also want to share like how do you deal with loneliness is one of the question is the question I
17:54
want to share like there is a there is an aspect of um loneliness that I have
17:59
felt in like among
18:06
among my peers like among people in my field like of
18:14
ministry in the body of Christ like I've definitely felt that um
18:25
but you don't have to let it get you down it's very important sometime many times when you feel loneliness there's
18:31
that the enemy wants you to feel rejection through that or there's something wrong with you or pity and
18:40
victimhood like especially when you don't deserve it many times the enemy may want you to feel like a victim and
18:46
feel sorry for yourself but that's the enemy you got to recognize that
18:52
um Jesus was rejected by so many he was rejected by his peers he was rejected by
19:01
the leaders in the body of in the church of those times the the the the the godly
19:07
leaders of those times um or the the men of God in those times he was so rejected
19:13
and he says that we will be rejected too [Music]
19:20
um and so we don't need to be disturbed by it
19:26
um upset about it it's just like a fact of reality but that doesn't it it's a
19:31
sign it's part of the persecution it's part of that sign that we are really in God's will and being used powerfully by
19:39
him that the enemy is bringing these kinds of feelings and
19:45
actions through people to try to stop us you know so
19:52
um if I if I when I if I feel that kind of loneliness but then I see the love of
19:58
God and the love of the revival army and the support of the revival army and if I
20:05
can put my focus there and value what God has given and not see what I don't have I don't feel any kind of loneliness
20:14
i I feel so content i feel so full um loved and supported so so much of it is
20:22
your perspective if you're seeing and thinking but God's perspective or what the enemy wants you to think so if
20:29
you're putting your perspective in the wrong place you're going to feel lonely you're going to be a really lonely feeling person so that's very important
20:36
you you renew your mind should I always strive to be myself and
If you are not naturally feeling joyful, should you "force it" or is that being not authentic?
20:43
authentic or should I force myself to be full of joy at all times even though I
20:49
don't feel joyful
20:56
well so basically this is how it
21:01
is really what the simple answer is stay in God's truth and everything else will
21:09
follow perfectly like just simply stay in God's truth like be thinking correctly because
21:17
there may be some I've I've experienced this before i've experienced where you know through something through
21:25
somebody through some some circumstance the enemy speaks something negative speaks something you know maybe I can be
21:32
really so excited about the future and so excited about God's promises that are going to come to pass and so hopeful and
21:40
expectant any day now you know um and then have in my mind like how it's going
21:46
to look like but God's timing is so much different than ours like I mean his ways
21:52
and his timing are so much different like with um with the revival breaking out nowhere
21:59
in a million years would I think that it was going to pan out the way it did i mean I really thought I was thinking in
22:07
a logical way i was like planning it out in my mind imagining how it was going to look like and I really thought that
22:14
every every month every year there would be growth gradual growth at the ministry
22:22
and that revival was just going to like it was going to be blossoming it would just like keep growing and keep growing
22:28
and keep growing to be so big but just gradually but we literally got smaller
22:34
and smaller each year for four years and then
22:39
overnight God made videos to go viral and revival broke out like overnight so
22:46
fast um hundreds now coming like like one week before 80 came 300
22:54
came the next week and it was hundreds ever since that day and a global revival ever since then in 2021 and just a few
23:02
months prior to that there was just like five people at the at the park at the church service just a few months before
23:09
that there was one person and they left in the middle of my message and at that time there was like pretty much hardly
23:15
any social media following i mean just like 1,000 people you know of followers
23:21
so um never in a million years would I imagine that that was how God was going
23:27
to do it so anyways um that continues to be how
23:33
life is i found like um God gives us the promise god says
23:39
what's going to happen but he doesn't tell us the in between he doesn't tell us exactly how it's going to happen he
23:44
doesn't tell us how he's going to open up doors and how he's going to bring this to h bring this about um that's our
23:50
walk of faith and um so but we're called to live in expectancy and hope and that
23:55
definitely includes having that feeling of any day now you know which is a good thing to have that's part of keeping our
24:02
flame lit you know like not being like the virgins who got lazy and didn't keep
24:09
their um oil burning their lamps burning um and they missed when the bridegroom
24:15
came so God wants us to be that way but that does mean that that's there's going to be like disappointment moments not
24:21
disappointment in God but disappointment in our own expectations because we're just so excited about it um so yeah so I
24:28
experienced that a lot i've experienced that and I and I noticed when those things happen in the past that like the
24:34
enemy can bring a negative thought um like the opposite of hope you know uh an
24:43
expectation um and like a discouraging thought and this sometimes a thought
24:49
like this is going to take so long and it's going to be so many more years you have to wait and things like that um and
24:57
I've noticed that like in the past for me like if I'm thinking like that like I won't be as joyful naturally um and so I
25:05
first of all want to say like this is the spiritual war we're in and it's part of following God that sometimes a
25:11
circumstance will happen enemy will bring a thought
25:17
and you won't automatically feel joyful because of that you don't need to get
25:22
down on yourself you don't need to condemn yourself for not naturally feeling as joyful but you do need to
25:28
take action and renew your mind and thank God and praise God and
25:34
um and take more intention to renew your mind take more intention to fill
25:40
yourself with the word of God so that the enemy doesn't pull you into some kind of slump you know your natural
25:46
state should be joy there can be some days where you don't naturally feel that joy because of circumstances um or
25:53
sometimes it can be just that you didn't get much sleep and you're really tired or something you just don't naturally feel like yourself you don't feel like
25:59
tons of joy the important thing is is to remember that's not the real you and to
26:05
make that intention to get back on track to to fill yourself with the truth and
26:11
not go the other way and then everything will follow the joy will follow um and
26:17
I've seen that to be true time and time again in my life like the joy just follows i don't have to like force it i
26:23
don't have to feel like I'm being fake i just keep keep the truth in my heart
26:31
keep the truth on my lips keep the truth in my mind um and make that intention to
26:36
make sure that truth is staying there and everything else follows simple just as I say the theme lately is it's simple
26:44
i shouldn't say just lately but this is the the way of following Jesus it's simple everything else follows um and
26:52
so what I will say is that you should put on
26:57
joy when you're around people though like you know like you don't What I'm
27:03
trying to say is like maybe you feel inclined to like praise so joyfully you know put on
27:11
a worship song and like praise with so much joy and dance
27:17
um you might feel that naturally one day and maybe another day you're still praising God you're still praising God
27:24
maybe through just serving him it's not that we have to put on a song to praise every day you know so but you don't just
27:30
naturally feel like so full of joy but you're still praising God with your obedience to him through serving him um
27:38
but but you don't need to like force yourself to do that same thing you did
27:44
yesterday with putting on a praise song and singing with all this joy and dancing now there are some times though
27:49
like like in battle like when the enemy is really attacking where it's like I
27:55
need to praise God with everything i need to jump and dance and shout and
28:00
proclaim his victory it's like a serious time of renewing your mind with praise
28:05
so that time like make that intention but what I'm trying to say is like you don't have
28:12
to over complicate your daily life um like on a day that you're like
28:19
naturally full of like so much joy and you're like I feel like put on a priest song and just dancing cuz I'm just so
28:24
full of joy the next day you don't have to feel like you have to do that same exact thing or that you're not as
28:31
pleasing to God that day or something um you can be serving God and obeying him in a different way um but when you are
28:40
around people and you don't feel as naturally joyful it's not that you have
28:45
to be like hi you know like you can you can still show kindness and love without
28:52
maybe being as wildly hyper as you was were the day
28:57
before for example you know what I'm saying um you can still show kindness and love
29:03
and the the continual joy and peace of the Lord
29:10
um as you interact with people so you know if you need to if you're not
29:16
feeling yourself like definitely put on that joy but you don't have to feel like you have to
29:23
um be really hyper for example well you can you can you can just smile and show kindness and love
29:31
still even if you're not having so much wild energy for example the real you is
29:37
you on your best day that's so important because I used to get down on myself when I wasn't naturally feeling joy
29:43
because that was usually um or so much joy I should say because that was those are usually times of like serious
29:49
waiting um and it would be hard and sometimes I would like notice I wasn't as joyful and
29:57
I would start getting down on myself and thinking God was disappointed that I wasn't like that I should be so much
30:03
more full of joy and I was like not I was I was I was not valuing like what
30:08
he's blessed me with just cuz I wasn't full of so much joy and it was just the enemy trying to bring condemnation so that's when God
30:15
spoke to me the real you is you on your best day so that's the real you um so on
30:23
other days when you don't feel like yourself just know that's not the real you that's you're in a spiritual war and
30:31
um that God God knows the real you and that's what he sees and that's that's
30:36
the default you that's the you most of the time and that's still you on days where you don't feel that way
30:44
naturally what do you do when symptoms start coming back after being healed or freed so I have a playlist called
What to do when symptoms start coming back after being healed or freed?
30:50
maintaining receiving and maintaining your complete deliverance on my YouTube watch all of that where I go even more
30:57
in depth um also in my book Unlock Your Deliverance I go over in several
31:03
chapters I go over just what you're asking how to maintain your deliverance one of the biggest schemes of the
31:09
schemes of the enemy is to try to think try to convince you that you didn't
31:15
really receive deliverance or that the healing or deliverance you
31:20
received left um that's one of the biggest schemes of the enemy he comes in
31:26
a lying way but it's not real it's not true you have to reject the enemy and he
31:31
will flee even if it's not immediate you keep rejecting him and he must flee day
31:39
after day keep rejecting him and keep staying in the truth and there is
31:45
nothing that can hold you back from walking in that full freedom and
31:52
healing i've seen this time and time again over the years many years i've seen so many
31:58
people receive many miracles and keep their miracles but I've also seen many
32:05
people receive miracles receive healing and deliverance and allow the enemy to come back with
32:14
his lies because they didn't know the schemes or they didn't take it seriously
32:19
and stand strong so that's why I say I know that I know that I know that if you
32:25
really value these teachings that I've shared you will you will absolutely see
32:31
complete freedom and healing and keep it and maintain it and walk in it the enemy
32:39
is so angry when a person is free it makes him more angry than anything
32:44
because that person that was like a victory for his kingdom when he had
32:50
someone in bondage even if they are a Christian it's like a victory for him when he's able to keep them in
32:56
bondage and and he knows like some people they could be staying in bondage and it could
33:02
lead them to doubt God and even leave the faith or it can lead them to be lukewarm because they're they're
33:11
they're not getting the full revelation of God's love because they're missing they're missing a big part of Jesus the
33:18
healer the the deliverer the one that brings abundant life so that's why I say the enemy sees it like as a victory for
33:25
his he sees it like as a victory for his kingdom when he has someone in bondage even if they're a Christian and so when
33:32
a person is set free that's a huge loss for his kingdom he's so angry every single time a person is set free he's so
33:40
angry and he knows that he can bring that person back he can bring bondage upon them again
33:46
if the person isn't equipped to know his schemes or isn't
33:52
serious to walk in authority reject him and apply these teachings these
33:58
principles that are in the word of God that I expand upon that I reveal the revelation of the principles of how to
34:06
walk in your authority reject the enemy and keep your healing and freedom
What to do if you feel like you can't keep up with listening to the teachings and serving God?
34:12
at times I feel like I don't have much capacity to do all the serving and listening to messages that I'd like but
34:17
could my priorities be wrong or am I making excuses so it's going to look different everyone is in a different
34:24
season everyone has a different capacity really we all have different lives when
34:30
you have children when you have young children the capacity you have is very different than someone without children
34:38
um if someone is traveling several hours to work and another person isn't
34:43
traveling several hours to work that's a different kind of capacity you know it's we all are on different have different
34:49
kind of capacities so this is what I would say the bare minimum which can be what is fine for some of you in certain
34:57
seasons of your life that you're in it's not like it's not enough it's okay for this season it's fine for this season
35:02
it's what it's right for this season so I would say the bare minimum like so where you're planted so the one asking
35:09
this question is planted at 5F church at 5F church so I'll say for you that Sunday must be a priority Sunday message
35:16
and the the mid midweek live if there is one should be a priority um if if I am
35:25
traveling ministering somewhere watching that live um if not and there's just not a live which is really rare
35:32
um but just watching a past one as a midweek and um subscriber Q&A if you're
35:41
able so that's three messages that would be like the bare minimum i also have a
35:48
pod week that I release every podcast that I release every week if possible listening to that too but I would say
35:54
like that's the bare minimum like the two to three per week would be the bare minimum but that that's important to
36:02
make sure you're really being fed spiritually every week but like you should you should renew your mind
36:11
like what like probably watch the message on Sunday or message like twice if possible for like the second time
36:18
maybe to really take notes and really make sure you're retaining it and not losing it not forgetting it and then
36:26
throughout the week like make that intention like it could be like a devotional like in the morning like renewing your mind with what you learned
36:31
on Sunday and just getting that truth in you more maybe looking over your notes um so that that food really nourishes
36:39
you really stays in your spirit that food that you received so that you're
36:45
keeping on growing and you're equipped with what you need for the for spiritual warfare that could come
36:51
um with different situations different things that could come you're equipped now you have this food the spiritual
36:58
food equipping in you um so yeah I mean that's so that's so much more important
37:03
than trying to like take in millions of messages but not really just listening to them just to listen to them but not
37:10
really nourishing yourself with them really taking in fully yeah so um and
37:17
then there's ways you can figure out how to um like if you're folding laundry for
37:24
example like that's the situation where you can kind of be like fully listening almost like almost fully listening so if
37:32
you're really trying to find time you can be creative i mean I would advise for the most time like and even like
37:38
driving like usually you're able to like really listen well while driving unless it's like a uh in the middle of a city
37:45
driving or something like that you know but just get creative to find ways to
37:51
incorporate listening listening to the teachings um if you don't have like that
37:56
capacity but you don't but then other people like especially if you are new if
38:02
you are new to the new wine you're new 5F church for example there's a lot you got to catch up on you got to watch the
38:07
revival army training playlist so in the beginning for sure it's important to
38:13
take in more more teachings um if that if you're able to in that season of your
38:18
life for example and then so other people will be in different seasons where they have more time on their hands and then God would want them to
38:25
um take in more teachings maybe like a teaching per day
38:31
um God or or not a teaching per day but like a teaching on one day and then
38:37
listen to it again the next day like to really take it in so maybe like a few messages per week and like listening to
38:42
them twice each you know it's just different for everybody um but yeah just be be okay to know your
38:50
your capacity and that you're not missing out um if your life is really
38:56
busy as long as you just take it seriously the the messages each week um
39:03
and in terms of serving that's going to look different for everybody too um I'll say that it's important for most people
39:10
it's going to be very important to have a full-time job because to live we I
39:15
mean to live we got to work to eat food and have shelter and have um things that
39:22
we need money to buy things that we need clothes and and and and other things we
39:28
we need to work like most people need to be working full-time jobs um there could be a certain season where it's a
39:34
part-time job and you have I don't know a parent helping or something like that i went through that in the past you know
39:40
but like for the most part that's just kind of the simple way of life that's
39:46
important um to make sure you're not uh unnecessarily
39:53
like draining from someone when they you know um when they need money for
39:58
themselves to live type thing um and unnecessarily um unnecessarily like in a place of like
40:06
poverty that you don't need to be in that that's causing spiritual and
40:12
physical heaviness to your life that it's as simple as having a job you know
40:18
so it's important um so on on how much you work and the
40:24
distance it takes to travel to work and other responsibilities you have if you have children d that's going to depend on how much you can serve so if you can
40:33
spare a little bit of time each day even if it's like a half an hour or 1 hour
40:38
then that's that's fine you know there'll be other people in different seasons where they have more time to
40:43
serve and they can serve more but what I'm trying to say is don't compare yourself it's everyone's in a different
40:49
season has a different capacity and um one of the big things that religion
40:55
does is try to what I found is like try to tell you that you're supposed to be
41:00
doing all these things and there's literally not hours in the day to do that you're a human that has to sleep
41:07
you're a human that has to go to work you're a human that has to take care of the kids or you're a human that needs to rest you're you know I mean religion is
41:16
just trying to tell you to do all these things it's impossible so you continually feel like you're messing up
41:21
you're not good enough your heart's not good enough when it's as simple as you don't have hours in the day to do all
41:27
this god's not asking you to do all this because you don't have hours to do this and this is not necessary for do for you to do
41:32
this so yeah make sure you live in that grace and that realistic way simple
41:38
realistic way of like wisdom like knowing this is the hours I have to work
41:44
with and I will serve God with this that I have i've been battling my flesh when it
When struggling with areas of being carnal, how do you overcome?
41:50
comes to comfort entertainment and not working hard how do I surrender and let God help
41:57
me without striving to do it myself and be burnt out chasing perfection um so first of all take it to
42:05
God and just be open and naked before him and just share with him like I see
42:10
that there's these areas of fleshliness that I that need to be transformed more into your image and I want that Lord i
42:17
want that i don't want to hide that from you i I can't do it on my own and so I invite you to help me and give me
42:23
strength that's huge because when we don't do that it's easy to get caught up
42:29
in religion it's easy to be doing things like separate from God's power and strength and then it becomes impossible
42:37
and it becomes so difficult and heavy like I remember in um I remember in
42:46
college I would make the intention to read my Bible every day and it was so heavy and so hard and it felt like it
42:53
was I knew like had knowledge that it wasn't going to be so like painfully
43:00
boring or something like I knew that but it was spiritual it was the spirit of
43:07
religion of heaviness it was like it was like heaviness on top of the Bible in my life where I couldn't lift the cover and
43:15
um and then then it was just constant condemnation and I I just it was like
43:21
something it was spiritual that was like speaking to me that it was so hard to do
43:26
this and it's so weird looking back it's just knowing just you just know it's spiritual
43:32
um but that whole time I remember feeling like God was condemning me and so me going through my Bible was like
43:39
separate from God it was like not seeking God to give me strength and help to do that it was like God's watching me
43:45
like well you do it i can't believe you haven't done it yet and me not inviting
43:51
him to help me do it to help me open the word and make time and make it a priority and take the time and um yeah
43:59
and so it became impossible so that's why I say religion when you do things
44:05
um outside of God and inside religion with like led by religion it'll be
44:12
impossible it'll be impossible it be so heavy and it will seem like the the
44:18
biggest the hardest thing to do and most annoying thing to do kind of thing so
44:24
it's so important you renew your mind that you don't have this perspective of like gh to not do these things that I
44:29
want to do and to do these things that I'm supposed to do is so heavy and I don't want to do that like having that
44:36
in your mind is like the the the spirit of religion is leading that and God's not invited in that so that's
44:43
why I say it's so important for you to be naked before God be open um like
44:49
inside like your heart open in your heart naked in your heart before him and
44:56
um allow him to help you and then now you're inviting him instead of like
45:02
seeing him watch you from afar like with his arms crossed which is not what he's doing like are you doing it I'm watching
45:09
you know so um that will empower you and to renew renew your mind that doing
45:15
things um that pleased him is so exciting and it's how you show love to
45:21
him and it really touches his heart so that's what gives you motivation and empowerment and excitement and zeal and
45:27
enthusiasm to do these things that can feel hard to do these things of the
45:33
spirit and not the flesh um and uh if there's certain things that you
45:40
know it's important you cut out completely cut them out completely if there's other things where it's not that
45:46
they're worldly it's just that doing these things is taking up time that you
45:52
could that you should be spending other in another way to serve God cut back you know and so that like
46:00
cut back you don't what I'm trying to say is to not live in that place of religion
46:06
but live in that place of like grace and knowing it's okay to do these things the
46:12
things that aren't dark and know it's okay but just in moderation to do be doing things in moderation where where
46:19
you still have time to do the things for God is is how like serving
46:27
God is a joy and not something so heavy heavy because we are living here on this
46:33
earth so um like it's like we don't need to be
46:40
hard on ourselves for getting a good night's sleep we don't need to be hard on ourselves for having um for not
46:45
eating only vegetables only and fruit and you know it's okay like moderation
46:52
is is is a good thing and it's how God wants us to live
46:59
like not as I've said before not sacrificing unnecessarily where he's
47:04
things he's not sacrificing you to because that asking you to sacrifice because then it makes serving God so
47:11
heavy And it's like he's you think he's asking you to do things that he's not asking you to do and then that that's beyond your capacity and you living as a
47:17
human it's like impossible to do that you're not like an angel you know so um
47:23
it's kind of like rest like rest does wonders like a day off does wonders i'm
47:29
like amazed sometimes like the day after taking a day off how I feel i'm like feel like a different person like I have
47:36
so much joy what am I so happy about like what oh like nothing exciting happened like what it's just it's doing
47:44
these things as a human and and having fun like refreshing and having just enjoying life just wonders because we
47:52
are a human on this earth and we can't live as like an angel we have to take
47:58
care of our body and our soul you know and so a lot of that includes like
48:04
moderation um yeah so when you do that then you're
48:09
in this balance where you're able to do everything that God is asking you to and it doesn't feel too
48:15
heavy hallelujah is keeping a clean house really a spiritual
Is keeping a clean house a spiritual thing?
48:21
thing yeah i mean um to have a clean house is
48:27
important because you can just see how um the difference i don't know if you've
48:32
ever like stepped into a house that's clean and you just feel like "Wow it feels nice." Or if you just have a house
48:40
clean your own house clean after not being clean and you're just like I feel
48:46
like he's you know if things are dirty it's chaotic um it's it's it's
48:54
um making your mind to not be at rest and at peace it's making it to be disturbed um your place at home is very
49:03
important that it's clean for your spiritual health for your peace in your
49:09
mind um and
49:14
uh it just really affects you it it can affect you if it's not clean that's it it can affect you spiritually and
49:20
negatively if it's not clean that's really what it comes down to now heaven is beautiful and in order and clean and
49:28
our lives should reflect that you know where we have the temple of the Holy Spirit we are the temple of the Holy
49:35
Spirit it should be someplace clean as well and put together um and
49:42
so you know you do not need
49:47
to like obs you shouldn't go on the other side and be OCD though like OCD so
49:53
like so obsessive um so like when thing
49:58
I like when if when I'm traveling it's like man there's just
50:04
like not time to put all the clothes where they got to go and there's just
50:09
not I mean there's times I'm I'm traveling i get back I got to do all
50:15
this work i don't even have time to rest i got to go to church the next day the next day got to throw clothes out of the
50:21
bag put new clothes in fly away come back the closer places like you know
50:28
what I mean that that's okay and of course as I see it I'm like uh I just wish it would be clean it feels so much
50:34
better and more peaceful but like that's just part of our lives as humans like we can't just go like this and it's clean
50:41
like it takes time so it's not that you need to be like obsessive over it maybe you're really tired one day
50:49
um you know you don't need with what I said you don't need to take that in an
50:54
obsessive way and get paranoid if your house isn't perfectly in order every
51:01
second i don't mean that but what I mean is like be aware of laziness be aware of
51:07
um the scheme of the enemy to bring laziness um and to bring that same
51:13
thought of like this is so hard this is going to be so hard to do this this is going to just be so difficult you don't
51:21
want to do this be careful of those mind of those thoughts in your mind because there could be more to that in the
51:26
spiritual realm that the enemy wants to keep you from having peace you know in your home it's so important to have
51:32
peace in your home um so it affects everything else you know the majority of
51:38
where you spend your time where you're resting where you're spending time with God so yeah it's going to it requires
51:46
discipline it requires intention um it requires sacrifice sometimes you don't
51:51
want to do it or you you don't have much energy to do it but you got to do it
What is the key to freedom from not liking kids?
51:56
what is the key to freedom against not liking kids i love them i just don't
52:02
have patience something in me changed during my life but I don't know how my feelings changed it makes me not want
52:09
kids so um everything you just shared and not just these things but this is
52:15
for everybody maybe you don't struggle with this but if you're finding a certain struggle um like in a different way of life
52:24
uh the biggest power is to change your mindset lift your
52:31
faith and renounce these things that you don't want there's so much power in your mind
52:38
and there's so much power in your words so much power in your faith in your mind
52:43
what you choose to believe and your words so as a man thinks so he is the
52:51
Bible says so a lot of people they have this mindset I can't do this this is how
52:58
I am i don't like this i don't like kids um I don't have patience and they have
53:04
that like mindset like this is the reality and this is who I am and that
53:10
has to change it has to change like you can receive freedom from that and you can be transformed completely but you
53:17
have to make the decision to change that's the only way it can happen so you have to change your mind you have to
53:22
renounce it and say that's not who God wants me to be god wants me to have patience i can have patience because I
53:28
have the Holy Spirit in me and God's children are beautiful and he says that we should be like children to enter the
53:34
kingdom of heaven so I actually need to not just love children but I need to look at them for examples in in certain
53:40
ways like in their character and their hearts that's where we're supposed to look there for their example like what I've been teaching lately at church um
53:47
and this past Wednesday I've been teaching like the qualities the characteristics of childlikeness and so
53:53
they're literally in children so we can literally look at them for example that's why Jesus literally brought his children in front of the crowd one time
53:59
and says "I tell you unless you become unless you humble yourself and become like a child like this child you cannot
54:05
enter the kingdom of heaven." That's what he literally brought as an example so like we really can look at them for
54:12
example like the the simplicity of their hearts the humility of their hearts the way they are teachable the way that they
54:18
are desiring to grow desiring to change um the way they have love and compassion
54:25
for other people and the simple mind that doesn't have um pride and selfishness and skepticism and
54:32
manipulation and all these complex things like we can literally look at them as an example so anyways um you
54:38
know you this is the truth i know that God wants me to love children because he wants me to love everybody and they're
54:43
his precious children and on top of that I'm actually supposed to learn from them so I really got to like this really
54:50
needs to change and God wants us to change so I renounce all this i renounce not having patience i renounce not
54:56
loving them i renounce the wrong perspective I have towards them i renounce the feelings that I have
55:01
towards them i renounce that all and I believe that this power of God that is
55:07
moving through the screen always like even today I believe that this anointing will touch me and free me from any if
55:14
there's any kind of yoke any kind of bondage that needs to to to be gone that's holding me back from loving and having patience I believe the power of
55:21
God will deliver me and then from there whether you feel any difference you feel any change or not I just posted we just
55:26
posted a testimony of a woman who was um set free of four years of addiction to
55:31
cigarettes but it was 4 days after she attended the conference Flourish conference last year that all of a
55:37
sudden she felt the addiction leave she she no longer had the feelings of of of
55:44
a craving cigarettes but it happened 4 days earlier but she didn't feel any difference until 4 days later so this is
55:50
how so many miracles happen so whether you feel anything or not feeling anything you change or not maybe you
55:55
still feel the same way towards children you feel impatient still you have to change your mind you have to choose to
56:01
believe you have to start confessing this is not me i have patience i'm not a person of no patience i have patience
56:08
whether you don't feel it whether you feel it or not i have patience and I love children and they are beautiful and
56:15
I actually need to learn from them and I will learn from them and you confess these things and you keep confessing
56:21
them and you keep rejecting and renouncing if the devil's saying anything otherwise or you're not seeing change yet manifest you just keep
56:28
rejecting keep renouncing keep rejecting the lies and keep declaring the truth
56:33
and as simple as that you will see change you will see yourself transform
56:39
you will see yourself become a different person you will have a different heart completely it will happen when you
56:45
change your mind and live in God's truth walking in your
56:52
authority for those of us who have PhDs of the old wine to receive the simplicity of the new wine are we then
In the new wine, is it okay to desire to have a master’s degree and a PhD?
56:59
able to get PhDs in the new wine is it okay to desire that yeah of course like you can go to school you can get your
57:05
masters you can get your PhDs i mean some people are called to be doctors they need to get their PhDs um but you
57:12
know what I've been teaching lately is that actually the what I've been teaching lately is that there's a danger
57:17
in so much knowledge now it doesn't mean we need to avoid knowledge worldly knowledge but um you know without having
57:24
this equipping there's that temptation to see yourselves greater than to to to
57:30
be prideful um but with this teaching and equipping like I believe there's going to be children and youth spiritual
57:37
children but I believe even like there's going to be spiritual children who just grew up in the new wine you know
57:45
and they're going to be cultivated in the new wine you know they're going to
57:52
be purity and humility is just going to be a part of them even like for me my
57:57
parents were so pure that just like through that upbringing humility purity was cultivated in me
58:05
just like automatically so I believe that people come to Palm to 5ft church for example
58:10
that they're going to be raised up in purity of heart and in humility and so
58:16
when they then go get their schooling and go get their doctorates their
58:22
heart's already pure and so they're able to remain pure they have the tools and the equipping to know how to humble
58:30
themselves and um when your heart's pure also I've noticed like it just happens automatically kind
58:37
of for the most part if you're really really really pure like when you're blessed you don't have that like I
58:43
deserve this you're like "Lord thank you." You know it's just the the when
58:50
the foundation is pure the rest flows as long as you keep being obedient and surrendered
58:58
to God the rest follows like those responses from your heart those feelings
59:04
of your heart of like the blessings that come and the lifting that comes it comes seeing it
59:10
seeing it for what it is that it's only by God's grace and you don't deserve this and God's only lifting you for his
59:17
glory for his purposes and not desiring people's approval and what people think of you
59:24
it's not in you you're pure so um those of you that are now being cultivated and
59:29
raised up in the new wine um as you go and do things as you are lifted as you
59:35
get not other knowledge like in schooling but even as you're just lifted in general lifted in the world's way
59:42
like promoted or something or your business really succeeds stuff like that
59:49
so whether you're lifted in like that way and it's God doing it or whether
59:55
it's like in ministry God lifts you in leadership um you you will have that natural
1:00:04
response of of humility and purity when you've cultivated that humility and
1:00:10
purity in you and that's that's you've been transformed you still should be
1:00:16
intentional to humble yourself though and if the enemy may come with temptations but because the foundation
1:00:21
is so pure you'll it's who you are and the enemy doesn't have a
1:00:28
chance to bring pride if you're serious about staying in obedience to God how to
How do you best answer someone who hears about this revival and comes back with skepticism?
1:00:36
best answer someone who you shared 5F with and came back with skepticism like where to point them first or what to say
1:00:42
um I mean just as a general answer to this question um generally just generally there people will have
1:00:48
skepticism if they don't have childlikeness and humility and purity in
1:00:53
their heart if there's some pride um I mean sometimes it also can be because
1:00:58
they've been hurt in the past and there's just like a wound there and there's fear and so sometimes it doesn't
1:01:04
mean they have pride but there can be that too but like when you are really pure in
1:01:11
heart um you can see the truth you can see the
1:01:17
truth um I mean there there also can be naive people as well so that's true but
1:01:23
but but in the majority and this is what I've found i found that the people that are like the most skeptical are the ones
1:01:30
with pride jealousy um so that's just something to be aware of you can kind of
1:01:36
discern who you're talking to because a person has to be open to hear so if they
1:01:42
don't want to hear from you there's not much you know you know you're really called to do but
1:01:49
um in general I would say respond just with kindness and love and just share my
1:01:55
life has been so transformed i've never seen so many fruits like I have here for example God's done this this this this
1:02:02
and this for me in my life and I've been here for this amount of time this amount of years and I've been following
1:02:08
consistently you know all the time and I'm just in awe of all the testimonies I've seen the Bible says you shall know
1:02:15
them by the fruits and I've never seen so many fruits in my life i'm just making this up maybe maybe you have
1:02:20
maybe you've seen other places too i'm just saying this as if this is what's true for you maybe you've never seen fruits like this because what Jesus is
1:02:25
doing in this new wine and revival is shocking hallelujah so you know you can share like I've literally never seen so
1:02:32
many miracles many testimonies so many fruits in my entire life and the Bible says you know them by the fruits and we
1:02:38
also know the enemy is angry um always angry he will always be the most angry at the most the angriest at the most
1:02:44
anointed and try to attack the anointed the most and he's so angry when God's
1:02:50
power is really moving um so we know that he will come in the same way as he did with um the Pharisees towards Jesus
1:02:58
false accusations intimidation fear trying to make people be afraid this is fake all
1:03:05
those things they did to Jesus so we know that will happen so but I bless you i love you praying
1:03:12
for you you know just you can keep you can keep it simple in
1:03:19
general and you don't have to feel like you have to say all that I just said right now you could just discern the situation and how open the person is
1:03:27
you could simply leave it as just sharing testifying like how much you were you've been blessed and transformed
1:03:33
and so you just desire others to be blessed too and that you know what's true that video exposed videos that
1:03:40
they're lies people lying with other churches the focus seems to be fellowship fellowship
In this move of God, what is the importance of fellowship vs. discipleship?
1:03:46
fellowship in this move of God what is the importance of fellowship versus disciplehip there's one teaching that's
1:03:53
missing so much in the body of Christ by and large and that's the importance
1:04:00
of keeping boundaries and bringing the right people in close and
1:04:06
um how one of the biggest ways the enemy can bring attack to a person is through
1:04:12
another person and there's a lot of believers who are not surrendered to God
1:04:20
there are there are sheeps and wolves clothing as well that that will be in every church there's just there's someone or a
1:04:26
couple people you know and um that's nothing to be afraid of about but what's
1:04:32
so important what's the foundation of at 5F Church is building people equipping
1:04:39
people to be surrendered to Jesus and to be wise and discerning and
1:04:48
mature um to as I was sharing earlier to not
1:04:54
depend on people to fulfill you but God to fulfill you and not idolize fellowship over
1:05:04
God and what God has really been building at 5F Church is like he's
1:05:13
really building in people maturity so
1:05:19
that they can be discerning of the enemy's schemes and the enemy can't find
1:05:25
all these loopholes within the church to attack people
1:05:31
a big reason why there's so much church hurt in other in in church in other in other churches that people have found a
1:05:37
lot of church hurt is that the enemy is moving so easily
1:05:44
through like fellowship because so a lot of people aren't surrendered because
1:05:49
they haven't encountered the power of God to free them also a lot of people aren't equipped to know the enemy
1:05:55
schemes they aren't equipped to know the importance of boundaries um and so they end up getting hurt at
1:06:04
church and it ends up being a lot of hurt people when they're supposed to
1:06:10
come to the church to be healed and to be strengthened and equipped to then go out in the world and help others
1:06:18
so um the the the very important foundation
1:06:24
is to lead people into surrender get them freed and healed surrendered to
1:06:29
Jesus and equipped to know the enemy's schemes and to stand on your own two
1:06:35
feet and be a strong believer where you're not swayed if the enemy uses
1:06:40
somebody whether they're in the church or outside the church you know like if because everyone's invited to come to
1:06:46
church so there can be people who come who are not serious about c God who come with a different motive um you know
1:06:53
that's the reality the doors are open wide so what's so important is for
1:06:58
believers to stand strong on their own two feet so that when the enemy uses if the enemy uses somebody to speak through
1:07:04
somebody um whether they're in the church among them or they're outside in
1:07:10
the world that they wouldn't be swayed but they would be strong they could discern the enemy's schemes not let the
1:07:16
enemy get to them through that person um and the focus needs to be
1:07:22
surrender to Jesus and serving God and we fellowship but we the we the very
1:07:28
important thing to do is to surrender everything and to serve God and I think
1:07:34
there's a lot of people that put so much focus on fellowship but not serving God and not doing the work of God they put
1:07:40
so much focus on fellowship but not spiritual growth and so you end up having a lot of baby Christians who are
1:07:46
not effective in the kingdom of God they're not effective against the the works of Satan so fellowship can be this
1:07:54
temptation that the enemy brings that keeps churches powerless and people
1:07:59
babies and not growing so um yeah so that's you know that's why
1:08:08
when it comes to everything we do at five church in terms of fellowship in terms of gathering in a fellowship
1:08:15
way it is not done it is not done half-hazardly it's not done in a rushing
1:08:21
way but it's done with wisdom from God to make sure that the church is ready
1:08:27
for everything that God then for for different seasons for ready
1:08:35
for you know like small groups are beginning and we could have started small groups so long ago i've I mean
1:08:42
we've been a global church for with people around the world for um
1:08:48
2021 and this has been completely God's direction and I'm like seeing a lot of
1:08:54
like the leaders how they've grown and how it's taken time for them to grow and
1:09:01
now it's at a place where we are ready to have these small groups
1:09:07
where people can be safe people can grow And also even leaders can stand strong
1:09:14
in the small beginnings they can stand strong because the enemy won't be happy you know that revival is expanding so
1:09:22
but they can stand strong so um yeah so
1:09:28
5F Church is led completely by Jesus and his direction and doesn't go along with
1:09:36
Christian culture of today but completely led by the Holy Spirit praise
1:09:42
God well thank you Jesus for all you've done today okay i want to declare over all of you here if any of you need healing from anything I declare all pain
1:09:49
and sickness to go from your body any issue physically that you're having I declare healing for you now in Jesus'
1:09:57
name and I declare any demonic spirit any way the enemy has come any way the
1:10:02
enemy has come back maybe you have not valued your healing you have not walked in your authority and rejected the devil
1:10:10
and maintained your deliverance or healing i declare this demonic spirit this bondage this sickness must go from
1:10:16
you now in Jesus' name and may you receive that healing again now may you
1:10:22
receive it and never may it never leave you again in Jesus' name be healed from
1:10:27
what you lost be healed now and may God be glorified through this testimony and
1:10:33
through your life in Jesus' name and I release this anointing upon you all and
1:10:38
I speak more fire and joy upon every one of you i speak victory over every every
1:10:45
battle of the enemy i speak victory to you and if any of you have been feeling heavy or not yourself I release more of
1:10:52
the fire of the Holy Spirit to fill you with more joy with more zeal more hope
1:10:58
and expectation and excitement to live and to walk in God's promises and to
1:11:04
live as a vessel for him this exciting life that it is where you are changing the world forever and shining your light
1:11:13
let this joy increase this revelation increase of the joy of living the joy of following God the joy of being used by
1:11:21
him the joy of shining your light let this revelation increase in Jesus name
1:11:26
and I speak wisdom to increase that all these questions that that you have not had answered that you have in your life
1:11:32
I speak wisdom to come to you now in Jesus' name because some there's some things
1:11:38
that you know there's some spiritual question spiritual questions we may have but there are some that are just like
1:11:44
practical questions that isn't really spiritual but as you grow spiritually you grow in wisdom so you're not making
1:11:51
like worldly fleshly decision so I just want to say that to you for for some of you like it's important for you to know
1:11:58
that when it's not that there's some there's some um things that you're
1:12:03
supposed to figure out on your own with the help of the Holy Spirit with wisdom
1:12:08
guiding you um when it comes to like practical type things day-to-day type
1:12:13
questions and so I want to bless you and speak wisdom to increase in you that
1:12:19
there would be no confusion but there would be clarity when you make these decisions that you are supposed to make as you walk with the Holy Spirit in
1:12:26
Jesus' name let peace and joy increase in you in Jesus name may the love of God
1:12:32
increase in your life in Jesus name amen
