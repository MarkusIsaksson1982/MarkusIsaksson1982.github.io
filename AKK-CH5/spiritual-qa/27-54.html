0:01
how to not let people's personalities dictate how much love you show to them
0:06
how to see people with God's eyes well
0:14
um how to see people with God's eyes the the biggest way to make sure you're able
0:20
to see people with God's eyes is to have your spiritual eyes open up how do your
0:26
spiritual eyes open up number one humility
0:31
that's what we see with the disciples when they came out when they came back from casting out demons Jesus said thank
0:36
you Father for hiding these things from those who are wise and proud and revealing it only to the humble and childlike so the big meaning of these
0:45
things is the deeper things of the spirit the spiritual realm your spiritual eyes thank you Lord for
0:50
opening up the spiritual eyes of those who are humble and not opening up the spiritual eyes of those who are proud so
0:58
one of the biggest ways to have your eyes open up is to be humble and then another biggest way to have your eyes
1:05
opened up is to constantly position yourself where God's power
1:12
is because um seeing the kingdom
1:18
manifest in power the kingdom of God manifest in power is is is also what
1:24
opens up your spiritual eyes when you have the two of those humility and positioning yourself or God's power is
1:31
that's where your eyes will really open up and so one of the biggest times that my spiritual eyes opened up to let to
1:38
lead me to see people with God's eyes was being at the highest level of
1:44
anointing I'd ever witnessed or experience which was at my spiritual father Prophet Dr Jord dav's church and
1:50
actually that day he was doing Mass Deliverance he was it was just a session of just deliver a a service of just
1:59
Deliverance Del setting the people free and um just again and again seeing the power
2:06
of God manifest the power of God making the demons to tremble and um and and and
2:14
and reveal like what's really going on in the spiritual realm what is um making
2:20
these people to be this way um seeing how evil the devil was
2:26
like how hard he's after people to torment them and to control them like my eyes open up to
2:35
see that like never before like whoa the devil's way more evil than I imagined
2:41
and the de Devil's way more at work than I imagined he's way more active in
2:46
people's lives to try to destroy them to try to um make them tormented to try to
2:53
um control them to act demonically like how the devil wants so from that day
2:59
I'll never forget foret that was the day that my eyes opened up like never before specifically to love God's people to see
3:04
people with God's eyes because it made me realize like the main reason why people are the
3:11
way they are is because the devil is at work in their lives um it's I mean people do have free
3:18
will people do have the choice to like accept evil and they they have the
3:24
choice to to to to do evil you know we still
3:30
have the free will um but you know God really taught me we don't really have a part to play
3:38
in that c that area of like trying to decide or judge if
3:44
someone's choosing to be evil or not type thing like our job is just to be
3:51
the light of the world and love people and want the best for people and so it
3:59
really we should be more simple-minded so when we see people um you know be mean to us um do
4:06
bad things um maybe their personality is irritating to us um when we see that
4:14
happen instead of like being a judge being judgmental and coming up with theories
4:22
like oh they're choosing to be this way you know we don't know all that only
4:29
God knows so let us not go there with our thoughts let our thoughts
4:34
be pure and and want the best out of best for people because that's what God wants I mean even murderers are not have
4:41
not gone too far to be redeemed like Paul was a murderer so imagine if God
4:48
has seen Paul who used to be Saul he's seen Saul um with such hope and such a
4:53
good light um wanting the best for him how about for everybody else who even
4:59
aren't murderers so to renew your mind is what you should be doing like to see people you know God
5:08
had hope and saw the best out of Saul when he was murdering Christians and was
5:15
the one doing the the the the biggest work of the enemy to try to stop the
5:20
work of God to save people and heal people and deliver people so if God can
5:25
do that for for Paul who was Saul I can God wants me to see this person in that
5:32
light you know and then just having that understanding we don't know people's past we don't know why they're the way
5:38
they are we don't know the kind of generational curses in their past that have led them to be This Bitter this
5:44
hateful this um have this pull towards
5:50
negativity we don't know the generational curses they have that they couldn't even help it they were born
5:57
Into Darkness because of that um we don't know about the abuse they
6:02
went through the trauma they went through we don't know and but we do know
6:07
that the devil is so after people's lives so everybody so when we find someone that
6:14
is uh you know hard hard to love it's safe to assume that they've been through
6:22
things they've there were things that happened that led them to be this way and so that should immediately bring us
6:28
to compassion passion so um that's that's the that's
6:34
the biggest key I can share with you of like just renewing your mind uh to see people in the right way you know give
6:41
them the benefit of the doubt think the best of them that's what Jesus does
6:47
that's how Jesus has looked at you he when you were in your at your worst he saw you at your best he he saw the best
6:53
of you he saw that deep down your heart was good he saw that deep down your eyes
6:59
just need needed to be opened up you just needed to have revelation of his love and you would change your ways your
7:05
wicked ways you know so um just renew your mind to that and just renew your
7:11
mind to how at work the devil is in people's
7:16
lives amen even for me I just think about how I had this natural tendency to
7:23
Purity so much because of my upbringing my parents my parents um
7:30
all I knew was just their example of purity of innocence of loving God of
7:37
never lying like never lying like I've never experienced my parents like lie
7:43
even like tell a white lie um I never experienced my parents
7:48
talk bad about somebody even uh so that was just like what I knew like I didn't know another life and
7:55
so naturally I will be that will have such an effect on who I become to
8:02
be is how God used them in that way but like I I look at people like I'm just
8:08
thinking of one person in particular right now and this one person did horrible things to me um and like hasn't
8:15
repented and um just unbelievable Unthinkable things but I know their past
8:21
I actually know their testimony I know their past and it's completely the opposite of my past like they had a
8:27
really rough past and you know that God's done a lot in their life to um
8:32
deliver them from things and everything but it just just
8:39
knowing the advantage that I had gives me more compassion like I
8:45
don't get the complexities of things I know this person like I still don't know like how they could choose to call
8:51
themselves a Christian and do this thing but I'm not God like I don't I I I can't
8:59
imagine what it's like for what they've been through in their past and I can't imagine how the enemy's like hunted them
9:06
in a way he hasn't hunted me because whenever you're in the um
9:13
whenever you're like in the devil's Camp so much um it's like the devil's more mad
9:20
if he's lost you and so you can definitely have Victory with Jesus and
9:25
it's nothing to be like afraid of like oh man I was really in the enemy's Camp so this is going to be hard
9:32
to just be free of him hunting me you know what I mean I don't mean it in that way but I do mean like I mean there is a
9:41
the Bible talks about this benefit of the generational blessings like if you're not if you're family members if
9:47
you yourself haven't sewed into the devil's Kingdom you're not dealing with that reaping you're you know you're not
9:55
um Wanted by the devil so much you're like really out of his grip so much you
10:02
know um and I even see I I I even notice how like when I did open a door to the
10:09
enemy when I was living a lukewarm life in my teenage years I see how there was
10:14
like I didn't get demons when other people could have gotten demons like when I opened up the door to um to
10:21
things in the worlds where maybe if someone generationally there's a generational curse or something the
10:28
moment they started drinking drinking alcohol for example they would immediately like be addicted for example
10:35
um or the moment they slept with someone they would immediately have an imperor
10:40
sexual Spirit come through that person just because of like their past so anyways um when when you have slash your
10:49
family has been um sewing so much into the devil's Kingdom really been in the
10:54
devil's Devil's Camp it's like you do need to
10:59
be really aware that you know you're wanted more by the enemy like he's extra
11:05
mad and you have the protection from Jesus 100% And you have the victory but
11:10
you have to be even extra diligent even more diligent than like the average
11:15
person to keep every door shut to the devil and reject the devil's lies and
11:21
stay focused on Jesus and sew even more into God's Kingdom in every aspect of
11:27
meaning of sewing you know to really um get far away from it's like this is an
11:36
amazing um I love this beautiful analogy uh my spiritual father actually shared
11:41
with me he said it was like um it's like when you're okay so when you're in the
11:48
devil's camp and then you leave the devil's Camp meaning even just being set free
11:55
like set free from demons and choosing to be all in for Jesus and surrendered and being planted where God's anointing
12:01
is and all of like surrendered to all of everything to Jesus all of God's
12:06
principles so when you do that it's like leaving Egypt and headed to the promised land Promised Land meaning like really
12:14
walking in your calling really accessing all of the areas of abundant life like
12:19
going like Egypt being in the deficit and then leaving the shores of Egypt
12:25
you're kind of like at zero or one or two or three like meaning in the Abundant Life and then the promised land
12:31
being like I don't know a million like you know you just keep going up and up
12:37
Abundant Life Abundant Life Abundant Life abundant so it's like so it's like uh dungeons the
12:45
dungeon is under here the prison and that's in the deficit that's bondage that that's bondage and then you get set
12:52
free and you're no longer in the dungeon You're outside of the prison but right side out of the prison doors and then
12:58
you're at zero you're set free but you're not in abundance yet and then you go above you keep going higher and
13:04
higher like day by day as you keep your surrender is you keep surrendering to Jesus and you keep obeying Jesus and you
13:11
keep sewing into God's kingdom So eventually you're so you're really far from the deficit it's really out of your
13:18
sight so anyways when you leave so it's like leaving Egypt when you when if you're on a boat I know this well
13:25
because on semester C this cruise ship study abroad program I took a across the I took where you go across the world on
13:31
a SHP we would always leave the dock and um I mean we'd leave the city you know
13:37
obviously to go to the next destination the next port and as we would leave you could see the city lights for
13:44
a while maybe even when you just leave you can still hear the hustle and bustle
13:49
of the city right so when you are just set free
13:55
it's like you've left the shores of Egypt you've left the if this is if this if this is Egypt the
14:02
boat has left the shore but like when you're here you're totally delivered you're totally you're totally surrender
14:07
to God you're totally in God's hands right here but you can hear the hustle
14:13
and bustle and see of the city and see it still and eventually as you keep going it becomes out of sight and you
14:18
can't hear it anymore hallelujah hallelujah so um that's what
14:26
it's like like you need to understand like when you just leave Egypt Shores especially if you've been into Egypt if you've been um in bondage for many years
14:34
it's like you've just left the shores you're not that far from the enemy's Camp you need to be extra diligent extra
14:40
diligent to stay focused on the promised land to not look back uh like Lot's wife
14:46
you know and just really be extra diligent when you're closer when when
14:51
when it's when you've just left Egypt um yeah so anyways back to what I was
14:57
sharing like there's this one person specifically that I know their past I can't imagine like what they've been
15:03
through and so I know that really the devil hunted them in this area to do bad
15:10
things you know and that's not an excuse for them that's not an excuse but what I'm trying to say is like I've never
15:16
even been in their shoes like I would hope if I was in their shoes I wouldn't do what they did but who am I to judge
15:23
you know like who am I to judge like in humility let me just like realize like
15:30
the devil might have tried even like so much harder in their life than I've even ever imagined so it just it just
15:37
releases you from that judgment it releases you from this like having hatred towards somebody because of what
15:44
they've done to you and it just um releases you into this place of humility
15:49
of like all I know is the devil is so evil I know the devil's after every person I know the devil's after that
15:55
person and so I don't know the details I don't know the specifics but I know that
16:01
there's a spiritual element to this I know the devil really hates me and is really trying hard to find someone to
16:06
work through and so you know I just I don't take it personally upon the
16:13
person if the anointing is taken away is one still saved can you have the Holy Spirit but no anointing and still be
16:19
saved are you saved even if you've never had an encounter with Jesus so the Bible
16:26
says that you will be saved when you believe that Jesus is Lord and Savior and you speak
16:36
with your mouth he is the Lord you know you make it real you make
16:41
it you don't just keep it inside but you confess it it brings
16:48
it as like a covenant like into reality as you
16:53
speak um so that's how to be saved but
16:59
the Bible also talks about the narrow road is where salvation is and few find
17:07
it it says um so but we also know the grace of
17:12
Jesus is so massive it's so massive and so God doesn't really want us to worry
17:19
about or to think too much about the complexities of Salvation he just wants us to focus on surrender to him and not
17:27
worry about the complexities so you can be surrendered to Jesus and maybe you
17:33
have never encountered the anointing um you can will be saved the
17:38
power of God you know you'll be saved I know like for example this anointing this power of God that that God has
17:44
restored to the body of Christ now here in this end time Revival um it hasn't reached the point
17:50
where everyone has heard about it or experienced it or encountered it yet and so of course if those people haven't
17:59
encountered the anointing yet they will be saved um but then at the same time
18:04
there could be people that are claiming they are Christians they could even be
18:10
leaders um but they reject the anointing they reject the move of God and we can't
18:17
be sure about that their salvation it's not our job to judge but there isn't that certainty we do know God's grace is
18:24
so big but it is dangerous it's very dangerous um you know the Bible talks
18:29
about the the blasphemy of the holy spirit is unforgivable sin um and that's
18:34
not something to make people like afraid of but it's more just to give us the fear of God realizing that man we it is
18:42
never our job to speak against the move of God the even if we think maybe it's not the move of God we
18:49
still shouldn't talk about it we shouldn't reject it what if it is people have been wrong in the Bible so many times there were so many people wrong
18:56
about Jesus so it's not our job to speak against something that um could
19:04
be could be the Holy Spirit right so
19:10
um I God doesn't want you to be like
19:15
worried about your salvation or others salvation but he wants to you to he
19:20
wants you to focus on surrender he wants you to focus on humility and that's all
19:26
you should be focused on when you're humble and when you're surrender surrendered you will be saved and and you you you call you you believe that
19:34
Jesus is your lord and savior and you speak it aloud you are saved you will go
19:39
to heaven um not Perfection it's not Perfection leades to Salvation it's not
19:45
works that leads to Salvation so it doesn't mean it has to be a perfect surrender it can mean that you're doing
19:52
your best but sometimes you've made a mistake sometimes you make mistakes in the future but the real the surrender
19:58
means that like when you do make a mistake you when you do step out of
20:03
God's will you more than anything want to go back to God's will you will repent
20:09
so um it's important you're not looking in the wrong way of like you're in God's will you step out oh am I going to be
20:16
saved because I stepped out of God's will well if you're keep on staying on that path maybe not but you need to
20:25
understand it's about the continual coming back to Jesus and we should get to the point when we have all that we
20:32
need spiritually through the fful ministry through the equipping through the power of God we should get to a
20:37
point of maturity where we're literally every day in God's will maybe once in a while a quick um mistake a little
20:45
mistake but we should really get to that point where we're constantly in God's will the holy spirit's in us so that
20:52
should not be unattainable and the Bible says that God has not given us any kind of Temptation that we won't be able to
20:59
overcome so when you're really accessing the fullness of the Holy Spirit by
21:04
abiding by his principles such as accepting how the Holy Spirit comes
21:09
through ministers fivefold ministers Your Leader um and and and surrendering
21:15
to his principles like being planted and truly being a disciple not a lukewarm
21:21
Christian and doing Christianity your own way but when you're doing all these things you should be just staying in
21:28
God's word will because the holy spirit's in you so he's not going to sleep and
21:33
forgetting to tell you oh go this way to St in my will go this way to stay in my will amen um yeah long story short to
21:41
answer this question uh really don't worry so much I mean there's going to be some people that maybe they've never
21:48
even heard Jesus you know in China they have to have underground churches there's places where people cannot even
21:55
worship Jesus publicly um so obviously the areas or there's some countries
22:00
where the social media is um monitored so there might be some places I don't
22:05
know really for certain about this but there are probably some places where my videos are banned for example so um but
22:15
don't you believe God has Grace for those people who haven't heard of course of course and so there can be some
22:22
people that never hear that hear about Jesus um or maybe they've only heard the
22:29
old wine and so it you know they've only heard from Pharisees and so they never wanted Jesus from the old wine way um
22:39
but Jesus has Grace for them Hallelujah so there'll be many people who probably
22:47
Jesus will come to them in dreams maybe when they die maybe they've never heard
22:52
about Jesus maybe Jesus will appear to them the moment they die you know what we need to understand is that God's
22:58
grace is so good his love is so big we need to take him seriously and not play with his grace but we need to not spend
23:06
our time worrying um like that God is going to be thinking
23:13
that God is like so particular he's it's not works that leads to Salvation all right it's it's so it's
23:20
Grace it's faith and Grace and so um definitely the spirit of religion wants
23:27
you to be worried about self ation don't be worried but have the fear of God the
23:32
fear of God which fear of God is means to be surrendered and be humble and make
23:39
and make Jesus your best friend and Lord of your life where every day you're looking to him every day you're taking
23:45
him seriously ones say you taught us about
23:50
the other disciples who were doing the work of God but not in the way in the new wine way how do we help them see
23:58
there is a better way without bursting their bubble or do we so on Wednesday I
24:04
talked about a scripture where there are disciples saying to Jesus there are
24:09
people out there who are casting out demons but they're not with us um and so
24:15
I wouldn't call those people disciples I wouldn't say them other disciples because I would say really as I talked about as I taught on Sunday the true
24:22
meaning of disciple um is like the disciples that were with Jesus he says
24:27
you cannot be my disciple unless you pick up your cross unless you leave
24:32
everything and follow me and so those other people that were that that was referred to in that scripture Luke 9:49
24:39
now John answered and said Master we saw someone casting out demons in your name and we forbade him because he does not
24:44
follow with us but Jesus said to him do not forbid him for he who is not against us is on our side so
24:53
um uh so like when Jesus came and he brought he brought the new wine and so
24:58
his way was the only way I mean his way was the only it was the best way it was the one
25:04
it was the way that was full of the most truth but you know like the Pharisees
25:10
it's the same word of God that they were teaching so um it's not that the the the
25:17
Pharisees carried 100% everything was false uh it's just that Jesus was a much
25:23
higher truth because remember Jesus was with the Pharisees in the temples like learning from them like teach he even
25:29
taught in the synagogue and he he spoke that ver that verse from
25:35
Isaiah God has anointed me uh uh to proclaim the good news to
25:40
the captives to free the oppressed to um uh uh uh proclaim the good news to the
25:47
Blind and you know that verse so he was like coming speaking in the temple he wasn't going in there being like you all
25:54
are from the devil and teaching everything wrong like he was reading from the the same scripture that the
25:59
Pharisees believed in um but he carried this new wine and this higher truth like
26:06
it was so much greater and so much better and without the better without
26:11
the new wine the old way that's full of some truth can bring harm like the Pharisees
26:19
ended up bringing so much harm but it wasn't that they were like 100% wrong
26:24
about everything I mean it was the same word of God you know that they were teaching and the same God that they were
26:30
worshiping I mean they were worshiping the same God and then they crucified the same God but um it's not like they were
26:36
worshiping Buddha you know the Pharisees were not worshiping Buddha they were worshiping the same God so um so yeah so
26:45
like Jesus so Jesus's disciples were saying it could have been it could have been like Pharisees it could have been
26:51
people following the Pharisees it was people it was these people believing in the same God believing in the power of
26:57
Jesus and but but not really not surrendering everything and becoming a disciple of Jesus so that's representative of people
27:06
trying to bring the old wine and new wine together like not liking because people always okay people always like
27:13
parts of the new wine people always like parts of the new wine but they all but a
27:19
lot of people like the people that are SE in the old wine and not humble and like love the old wine like they love
27:26
the old way because of tradition because of maybe they feel so knowledgeable and
27:31
experienced in the old wise so they like to be professionals um it's what they're used to it's it's what's popular and
27:39
what um doesn't offend people and it's what's the majority like so that's so common today
27:47
people love the old wine way and then the new wine comes and then like certain aspects of the new wine they love I mean
27:54
they love even more than the old wine but then other aspects of the new wine they
28:00
hate and so if someone's not willing to give up the because it offends them other parts of the new wine will offend
28:06
them so if someone's not willing to give up the old wine completely they will ultimately end up rejecting the new
28:14
wine so that's some that's like the most common thing you find today like it you know and I know this from experience
28:21
from Ministry I find so many people that I can see they like they have the old
28:26
wine and like they're so excited about some aspects of the new wine but then
28:32
other aspects they do not like because it clashes so much with their old wine
28:39
then as as the Bible says you can't put new wine into Old win skin the old wines skin will burst so that's literally what
28:45
happens you have this new wine Doctrine new wine Revelation new wine of a new
28:50
way of doing things outside of the box and then the old wine has a different Doctrine and is inside the box and so
28:58
it's two things that's not working together yeah so um you find that a lot
29:05
today I I see that so often and I've seen a lot of people be so excited about
29:11
the Revival that's breaking out and then they don't end up staying they end up leaving a lot of them end up talking against the move of God they end up
29:17
being like Pharisees um and it's literally that's the reason the reason is usually because of Pride it also can
29:23
be because of jealousy which is the same thing if you have jealous if you have jealousy you have pride uh but because
29:29
of that like this Old Line they're hanging on to because of Pride
29:35
um it they they can't receive the new wine
29:40
fully and they end up end up leaving so when Jesus um or when the when John is
29:49
saying we saw someone cast out demons in your name it reminds me so much
29:54
like I remember like um I remember when the Revival first broke
30:00
out in the park and it was like there was like five people in our park in our
30:07
church service uh January of 2021 and then videos immediately went
30:13
viral God moved and powering the videos and so we grew to about 20 something people in two months in March 2021 and
30:19
then the first demon manifested in somebody in March show was in 21 and then every week more and more people
30:25
came where the next week it was like 20 something and then it was like 30 something the next week was like 40 something the next week was like 50
30:30
something the next week was like 70 something and then the very next week because word started really spreading
30:36
the very next week was 300 and that day was
30:43
chaotic because it was a lot of old wine and it was amazing I mean it was
30:49
one of the best days of my life because Revival broke out like we could imagine but um like it was so many people that
30:58
were coming in with their doctrines of casting out demons and
31:04
um uh not knowing about the new wine at all
31:09
not knowing about the revelation of authority and like the way how Paul Paul and Peter were casting out demons and
31:16
Jesus like not having that Revelation and so it's like it was so chaotic it was
31:24
like I was 99 99.9999% % Overjoyed but
31:29
like a tiny part of me was a little grieved but not really cuz I understood
31:34
like well this is inevitable like people have to be taught like this is brand new what God's doing so it was like 0 one%
31:42
that was grieved but um what I just mean is like oh man like things were done out
31:48
of order like people were just coming in with their old ways and what I mean is like there was demons manifesting
31:53
everywhere and everyone was just like get out get out like a million people not a million people there was 300
31:59
people but like most of the 300 people were screaming and like you know trying
32:05
to cast demons out everywhere because it was Revival broke out I mean demons were manifesting everywhere and um yeah it
32:11
was so chaotic but like there wasn't order but it it's just how it had to be
32:17
I mean there's no other way people have to learn that's how Revival is so I understood that and I I I wasn't I
32:24
wouldn't say I was grieved it's just like oh I just had to accept like okay
32:29
we are Paving the way and and then it changed and so it was a lot of um breaking ground at first
32:36
where a lot of people didn't understand and came so passionate with their old wine ways their old wine ways of casting
32:42
out demons their old wine ways of doing Ministry their old wine ways of alter calls and uh like how alter calls should
32:49
look and leading P people into salvation should look you know it was so much caving the way pioneering coming with a
32:56
new wine the new wine so um so John is basically saying
33:02
there's people that are casting out demons but they're not following us closely they're not really becoming disciples they're they're wanting to
33:09
take the parts they like about what you're doing Jesus and what you're teaching but only parts of it and
33:14
they're mixing it with their old wine and you know they're not with us like John can see um the grossness of it like
33:22
John can see like the lack of surrender and the um the it grieved him you know
33:30
you know I mean people have and people have all sorts of motives to to cast out demons some
33:35
people want it for fame and power and to feel to feel like they're an important
33:41
Christian or something you know all sorts of motives which I talked about in Philippians
33:46
1:15 also on Wednesday how Paul says some people Minister purely out of
33:52
rivalry towards me jealousy towards me they see the anointing in me Paul's saying and they want what I have and
34:00
they're literally like starting Ministries and doing these things just to like take over me like compete with
34:08
me and out of jealousy and everything and he says but then there's some people that minister with pure motives um and
34:16
he says whether whether people do it for Pure with pure motives or they do it impure don't stop them let them preach
34:25
still let them Minister still because it's better that if the the most amount
34:30
of people to be talking about Jesus to be preaching Jesus
34:36
and preaching about the Holy Spirit and deliverance that's what we want we're
34:42
all on the same team even if people are doing horrible things to us on the same
34:48
team but it's I I don't want to um cut
34:53
back in any way from anybody hearing the the good news even if it's done with with a bad motive you know
35:02
so that's that's what he says cuz even even if it's just even if just a tiny
35:08
seed is planted even if it's done with a pure impure motive but if someone talked about Jesus instead of someone talking
35:15
about it's better a person talk about Jesus with an impure motive to somebody than them
35:22
like talk about Satan them talk about hey like it's
35:28
better for them to like talk about Jesus even if they're doing it with gross and pure motives um it's better for them to
35:35
to to speaking so someone can hear about Jesus then that person instead with
35:40
instead of their impure motives talking about Jesus instead they're talking about witchcraft they're talking about hey you know I've tried this you know
35:48
going to this uh this uh psychic and stuff and whoa like it really helped me
35:54
like have clarity about my future or um you know hey like in you know um I I I I
36:02
cast a spell on somebody and it like worked I went to this witch you know like it's better for someone to talk
36:08
about you get it you know you get I mean you can even understand this in the world's way probably
36:15
like but if someone talks about Jesus with impure motives it's not going to
36:20
have like Mighty anointing on it and be able to do as much as it could be done if there was pure motives but it still
36:26
can do a little bit it can do better than someone talking about a
36:31
witch that's the meaning of the scripture so how do you help people who
36:38
are not fully in the new wine do better because you understand so John understood this is the way people can be
36:45
really be receiving the anointing if you'll just be a disciple of Jesus be fuling in the new
36:51
wine um well I think I kind of well so first of all you got to understand that
36:58
a lot of people that aren't fully in the new wine but are doing things their own
37:03
way a lot of them are choosing this out of Pride out
37:09
of jealousy they're choosing this way so you you it's not your job to do much
37:16
it's not your job to do anything many times just be a light you know Jesus did not make his mission to convert the
37:23
Pharisees he did not try to persuade convert the
37:29
Pharisees he pretty much ignored them you know um they were not
37:35
open to change um there were some like Nicodemus that Jesus Took time for so he discerned
37:43
Nicodemus his heart was different so he took his own personal time and planted
37:48
seeds in Nicodemus but for the most part he ignored the Pharisees he focused on the
37:55
people that wanted to receive him the people that wanted the new wine the
38:01
people with humility who were lost oppressed and
38:06
sick and knew they needed a savior knew they that that their life
38:12
wasn't working how it was that they needed something different they needed new wine they needed Jesus in his
38:18
fullness his anointing Deliverance healing he focused on them so for the
38:26
most part you need to focus on on them they're out there don't get distracted by the Pharisees or don't get distracted
38:32
by the people that are holding on to the old wine you can be have a lookout out have a lookout for those who are the
38:39
Nicodemus there will I'm telling you there will be very few they will be out there so how I mean I don't I don't mean
38:45
to say like close your eyes completely to the to the the people who are holding
38:51
on to the old wine you know but have you need to have the spiritual mature
38:56
understanding um that it's going to probably be most are not open they are
39:02
choosing to hold on to the old wine because of Pride and sometimes jealousy as
39:09
well so just be the example be the light because the the fruits will show themselves the fruits will show
39:16
themselves there are some people who are full of Pride and they're seeing all the fruits they're seeing your testimonies and there can be a time
39:23
where maybe they're in serious need I mean they are
39:29
are they're finding their way is not working they're finding they're in a place where they need the anointing the
39:35
power of God they are finding they need the fruits that you have the testimonies that you're testifying about because
39:41
some people sometimes in God's grace he'll you
39:46
know even though they're sewing bad things by rejecting God's move for example
39:53
um he'll give them Grace and he won't he won't allow like huge the huge
40:00
demonic re reaping to come upon them yet he'll give them Grace to repent he'll give them chance and timing but there
40:06
will come a timing when the times run up and the reaping will start coming the reaping of of rejecting God's move and
40:13
they'll start to find oppression sickness and they'll find and they knew all along like God's anointing God's
40:21
power God's new wine was true but out of Pride they just like ignored it but then
40:27
there can come a time where their oppression their sickness their need for
40:32
the anointing becomes greater than their pride and in that time because they've
40:41
seen all the fruit you've testified about you all have testified about many others testify about they will come they
40:47
will humble themselves and come and say I need this power I need this anointing you know you
40:53
see and I've heard this happen I've heard this my spiritual father testified to this and I've have another servant of
40:59
God that I talked to one time told me this like they've witnessed that in their Ministry they've witnessed how
41:06
people like reject them people are like Pharisees towards them but then they find one day they need the anointing
41:12
that they're rejecting so they come back they come back and uh
41:20
I mean they come in a different light this in a different way this time and repent and desire the anointing now
41:28
so um that's why I I I say again as I said in the beginning the testimony the
41:34
fruit is what's making the victory come for Jesus's move so you you know instead
41:41
of trying to force people instead of trying to say come into the new wine instead of forcing that on them so much
41:47
the people that AR open to it instead testify testify let the fruits open up their eyes so when there comes a time I mean
41:55
there's been so many glory to God there's been so many for example testimonies of um of healings of
42:02
cancer happening lately praise God and so people are seeing this and there could come a time when someone gets
42:08
cancer someone who's rejecting the move of God they get cancer and they become desperate and realize they need the
42:14
anointing their need for the anointing becomes greater than their pride and God will have Grace for them if they will really humbly repent and they can
42:21
receive healing because God's grace is so big Hallelujah
42:28
so yeah so that's my that's the answer to the question focus on um focus on
42:33
those who are ready to receive who want to receive and focus on sharing your
42:39
testimony and showing the fruits and sharing others testimonies because that's that's going to open up eyes more
42:47
and more and more to number one convict people more um and and number two to
42:57
help eyes to open up to to destroy the the the works of the devil to bring um
43:05
doubt skepticism towards and false accusation towards God's
43:11
move it's only by God's um strength that I've been able to
43:18
endure the persecution and keep going and the biggest secret is
43:23
just falling in love with Jesus and keeping your eyes on him and your love
43:29
for him my love for him and keeping my eyes on the truth
43:35
of how his promises must come to pass and his victory will always be with me
43:41
and um being spiritually mature to realize
43:47
that persecution is part of it and it's all over the word of God so not to be distracted like what's happening to me
43:55
how can these people do these things and having the spiritual maturity um to know God's timing is
44:02
different than mine like I had to go through that learning like I was going through like many false accusations came
44:09
against me still come against me all the time like every day but um those are the ones that definitely are like super
44:15
hurtful um but uh like years ago years ago there was so
44:22
many false accusations particularly one season of my life a couple years years a
44:27
few years a couple a couple years ago now and there's so many false accusations and um I I believed God
44:35
would I mean it was just so unfair and so unjust that I really believe that Vindication complete Vindication would
44:42
come like ASAP you know because it felt so unfair and I just had to be humble
44:50
and um and learn from the Bible like how Joseph he wasn't immediately Vindicated
44:57
David wasn't immediately Vindicated Jesus wasn't immediately Vindicated so I had to humble myself and and just
45:04
realize like this isn't what you thought it would be and that's okay you know
45:09
this persecution is worse than you thought it' be and that's okay it's taking longer to be Vindicated and
45:16
that's okay because it's all God's plan not your plan it's all in God's hands and
45:23
you so you just have to trust him you just just have to trust him that's
45:31
it so yeah that's that's that's how and my spiritual father was such a big part
45:36
of how I was able to endure the persecution and be strong and stay focused huge part huge huge huge part of
45:43
that huge part how he encouraged me how he spoke prophetically to me um yeah and
45:50
just his own testimony of how he's gone through over insane persecution false accusations but to see where God's taken
45:57
him from there like to see the victory in his life to see his ministry now
46:05
Hallelujah and another thing that's really helped me get through the persecution is God really spoke to me
46:12
like people need to see an example of loving their enemies and people need to
46:18
see an example of humility and death to self and death to Ego and God really like spoke to me through that like
46:23
there's something beautiful I'm doing through this like it's rare it's really rare to see so God spoke to me I'm doing
46:29
something beautiful through this like I'm showing to the body of Christ like it's a teaching example without words
46:37
without a te a sermon but there's a huge teaching going on to the body of Christ like this level of this level of Purity
46:44
this level of humility this level of death to Ego not caring how people see you or what they say about you this
46:51
level of love for your enemies is possible the standard has been here but I want it to be much higher here and so
46:58
I'm going to use you as an example through this and that really encouraged
47:04
me to see like this is not about me this is not about my Vindication but it's
47:09
about it's so much greater it's about teaching the whole body of
47:16
Christ something that they don't know they can have a higher level of Purity
47:24
and love it's exciting it's exciting when you think of about it like that so that really gives me strength even to
47:29
this day it gives me strength even because I hear like many of you testify about it like it's happened like what
47:36
you know how God spoke to that to me back in 2021 or 2 2002 of what God was going to be doing
47:43
through this how he was going to use this Joseph he said to Joseph what the
47:51
what the enemy Meant For What the enemy meant to harm you I intended did I
47:58
intended for good it makes me emotional to think about
48:04
that Hallelujah that's
48:09
powerful like the devil was like intending to destroy me and my Ministry
48:17
and God's work through me um but God didn't allow that to happen but instead he used every little
48:25
thing the devil did to teach and transform the whole body of
48:31
Christ to be more like Jesus and less like the enemy to love your enemies to
48:38
be to not care what people think and have Death to Your Ego for the sake of Jesus and to be God is so good and to be
48:46
pure and humble like I can see the devil so angry right
48:51
now glory to God like it didn't work and God used the evil he did for so such
49:01
good you know how will how will you learn how to love your enemies if you don't see an example in front of your
49:09
face of somebody loving their enemies that means that you need to see
49:15
someone who has serious enemies and who's done evil to a person
49:21
right yeah so I see it with that perspective it's like a beautiful sacrifice I've had to make make like I
49:28
sacrifice um my ego you know I sacrifice that um so that I can be an example for
49:37
for you for many people you know when you have that perspective it you see it's all worth it
49:45
it's all worth it and you see the goodness of God even more you see like
49:51
you know it's never when you're going through people slandering you and all of that evil it's not like God God is
49:58
punishing you um forgetting about you like God is doing something so beautiful
50:07
through this intending it for such good so it makes helps you to see the
50:14
goodness of God even through the valley of the shadow of death he is good and
50:20
he's using this Valley for such greater good and it's so it's like you look and
50:26
so I look back and I'm like thank God that happened if that could lead to transformation of the body of Christ to
50:31
for people to love their enemies be more pure be more humble um die to their
50:37
self thank God that I went through that like I'd do it again you
50:45
know do we still give if in debt this just is like it's it's really
50:52
just depending on the holy spirit in one situation um we live in a world with you know we live well I don't know
51:00
how everywhere every country is but in America you if you have a high credit you're
51:08
then able to get cars and houses where if you had bad credit you couldn't so
51:14
like credit is just a part of like living on this Earth um and so like getting credit cards is one of the big
51:21
ways to um have credit and have your credit
51:26
go higher and so what credit means is they loan you so you're in debt the moment
51:33
you charge your credit card technically but ideally you know you would pay you'd be able to pay it right off right off so
51:39
it's not really like you're ever in debt that would be ideal but I know that that that time doesn't happen immediately um
51:46
but still even if you as long as you are consistently paying something that can even um build your credit so it's not
51:53
like it's a horrible thing to like have debt because of what I just shared like
51:59
on this Earth it's the system of you need to have have credit you know
52:07
so have good credit you know so anyways um sewing's important sewing is how we
52:13
get out of poverty uh I mean the anointing destroys the Yoke of poverty but we also need to
52:19
to sew to reap so even if it's just a little bit that you have it's important to be sewing and so um it's okay to be
52:27
looking at you know credit cards as technically money you have as long as
52:34
you're being wise and making the intention and making sure you're having a job you know you're not like being
52:39
lazy but making sure you're having a job or if it's possible getting a higher paying job so that you're able to pay
52:45
all your bills and the the the credit card things and everything even like college like someone might be in a huge
52:52
um huge uh uh have tons of Mone from from college but they're on a plan to
52:59
pay it gradually now that doesn't mean you shouldn't be tithing until years later when you um are out of that debt
53:07
so it's it's okay to see as because of the system I just described it's okay to see as the the credit you have as money
53:13
that's that you have a way to a way to pay for things also a way to give um but
53:20
it's important just to be wise you have to lean on the Holy Spirit like um if all you have is credit card
53:27
uh credit cards and you're completely you have zero in your account all you have is credit cards but you have a lot
53:32
in your credit cards and you give all that's on the credit cards to tiing for example that might not be the most wise
53:38
thing it might be more wise to sew a little of from the credit card but then
53:44
use um the credit you have to be paying off bills to get out of debt and at the
53:50
same time doing everything you can to be um looking for a higher paying job or
53:56
looking for other pay ways of income so long story short you don't need to be
54:01
religious about it you need to be wise about it wise about it um so but overall
54:09
it's you know tithing sewing should be definitely a very important part of our life even if we're in a season where we
54:15
don't have much but even just a little bit because of to se a little bit because of this principle this principle
54:21
is leading to doors open doors opening for more provision to come
54:26
uh this SE sewing seeds leads to releasing of Supernatural
54:32
finances and even like this is not a this is not a
54:38
um what's the word I know I never even do these things so I don't even know how to call it sponsor an
54:45
ad but like be wise be wise I um have an apple card and it's like immediate cash
54:50
back and so it's like wow like you you pay something and
54:56
you're technically in debt for a moment but then you get money and then there's free money that you could like give to tithe for example like just just use
55:03
wisdom be be wise amen like use the brain God's given you and take advantage
55:10
of the resources that are out there to for the Kingdom's sake for for for for
55:16
for your sake of of being able to tithe and sew and everything amen
55:21
hallelujah how can we discern the difference between the knowing of the Holy SP Spirit and the same feeling of
55:28
knowing that the enemy angel of Light brings peace and
55:35
wisdom peace wisdom and the word of God is your
55:42
anchor the Rama word of God is your an anchor the spoken present tense word of God as your anchor pay attention to your
55:49
leader your teacher pay attention to things that I am quiet about and I don't speak about
55:56
if when I teach even about hearing the voice of God and I'm not stressing a certain area or something then that
56:02
probably means that God's not wanting you to go focus on something that's not
56:07
being taught even just even for this season even for this season maybe there's a season God wants to start
56:13
releasing tons of directional dreams to people for example and in that season God will prophetically lead your teacher
56:19
to speak about dreams and how to interpret dreams and how to know when this dream is directing You Here There and Everywhere I don't mean that that
56:25
that's not going to come at all I'm just saying like in the meantime because I hear so many people saying that God gave
56:31
them dreams about um that they would they would saw me praying for them in their dream and that was a directional
56:37
dream for them to come and um come to a Revival now event a Sunday service event
56:45
but those types of dreams are going to that God sends are not going to be difficult to interpret because those
56:50
people that get those dreams are also already seeing the fruits they're already experiencing uh eyes opening up
56:56
they're already receiving blessing from my Ministry for example they're already maybe sensing receiving some Deliverance
57:02
in their life so when God gives them that dream it it it he's making it easy to
57:08
interpret um easy to to know it's like a confirmation dream instead of this
57:15
random dream that's like hard to interpret what I'm trying to say is God is not going to make God is not going to
57:22
give somebody a word that's really complicated and hard to
57:27
interpret because we got to understand like your child are you going to want to
57:34
tease your child and make things difficult for them are you're just going to want to make it plain and simple for
57:40
them to Excel and succeed right you're not going to try to make things hard for them God wants you to be in his will
57:46
more than you want to be in his will but the problem is is we're like trying to over complicate God sometimes we're
57:51
trying to search him in ways that he's choosing to not speak but we want him to
57:56
speak in a certain way so we're seeking him in some place and then we get confused things aren't clear but if we
58:02
will be humble and um listen to what God is releasing for
58:09
releasing through our leader the prophetic word direction and just hold on to that word um that's where
58:16
direction is for example um this is a great example that just came to me thank you Holy Spirit Destiny shared this
58:23
amazing testimony that I shared on my story I believe two days ago um uh this amazing testimony about
58:34
um how she was led astray by the angel of Light to Le fold Church where she was planted where God called her to be
58:39
planted but then God like a Good Shepherd led her back to where he wanted her to be planted and now she's actually
58:44
moving here in person praise God there really amazing testimony and it really it will I encourage you to watch it if
58:51
you go to my Instagram highlights and hit testimonies
58:57
I think it's going to be like one of one of the mo more recent ones like one of the last ones on there but anyways her
59:03
testimony will open up your eyes to share like okay this is how the angel of Light led her and she thought it was God
59:09
and then this is how God led her and she knew it was God and now she knows the difference between angel of Light and God and
59:15
so the angel of Light was really speaking in her feelings like she was feeling a certain way like she was
59:21
feeling she was she was she was she she was from afar watching the services on
59:27
online and she was falling asleep in her bed watching it and at the same time she was like just getting bored of watching
59:34
online she just like missed going to church in person just in general just going to church in person and so she was
59:41
having these feelings but those if you think about it those feelings don't align with what had been taught by like
59:48
her leader like me for example at fivefold church like how um it's just so
59:54
important to be planted where God's calling you to be be planted for these reasons for these principles the reason he has you be planted in somewhere is
1:00:01
not about your emotions it's not about um that he wants you someplace physical now if you can get there physically yes
1:00:07
and there will come a time in the future where there will be more churches fful Ministry churches
1:00:15
with God's power that you can come in person but we are just in these beginning stages of the end time Revival
1:00:21
so there's going to be so many people that God's calling you to be planted but you don't live in that City but that's
1:00:26
where he calling you to be planted that the city where the church is he's calling you to be planted so anyways if she had heard the the word of God like
1:00:34
take held on to that word and and you know this is what God has spoken and
1:00:40
also been aware of um the the the how the enemy also I've spoken I've taught
1:00:47
this before and I'm just giving this example like just a way to how you can discern I had taught before how so many
1:00:53
times the devil can influence your feelings uh uh and so um sometimes you
1:01:01
have to reject those emotions those emotions are not your truth and [Music]
1:01:07
um and I've also taught about how the devil so badly wants to pull you away from uh where God's called you to be
1:01:14
planted and from where you're receiving true anointing and where you will fulfill your purpose and receive
1:01:19
impartation and equipping so you got to hold on to those words be aware of those
1:01:24
words and so when certain emotions come on you have to test the emotions with that word that God's called you to be
1:01:30
your anchor hold on to not anchoring your emotions but anchoring the word so you got to bring these emotions to that
1:01:37
word take every thought captive to Jesus take the emotions and thoughts captive to Jesus's
1:01:43
word like match them up with the word do they do they stand right so um I've also
1:01:51
taught about how uh sometimes the will of God is fun sometimes it's not so you
1:01:58
you can't be like oh this is uncomfortable this isn't fun oh that
1:02:04
must mean it's not God's will no sometime and and sometimes God's will is the most fun thing in the world so at the same time we got to be careful about
1:02:10
the emotions thing sometimes what your heart wants oh what your heart wants like for
1:02:16
example I shared this testimony also of this woman she was like I really feel called to move to LA but I don't know if
1:02:22
it's just my selfish desire and I confirmed with her it's not it's just that your is aligned with
1:02:27
God's this is a time when God's will is fun is the most fun thing in the world
1:02:32
so sometimes God's will would be the most fun thing in the world more fun than anything more more what you want
1:02:38
what makes you happy more than anything in the world and sometimes God's will will be the last thing you want well be
1:02:44
uncomfortable there it's different seasons amen so um so anyways if so I'm just
1:02:51
trying to say like okay if we did this over if we took this circumstance and did this over here's this angel of Light
1:02:57
coming in the feelings coming in the emotions coming in a spiritual way oh a spiritual sounding way it will be good
1:03:03
for you to come in person and it's good to which it's true many times it is good to be in person and if you can but at
1:03:09
the right place where God's calling you to be planted in and so um then you could discern what what the word of God
1:03:17
I mean what God's voice was and so so much of it is having to do with wisdom
1:03:22
wisdom wisdom not feelings not signs wisdom God can speak in signs God can
1:03:29
speak through feelings sometimes but wisdom wisdom wisdom with the the the
1:03:36
the the the spiritual maturity you've grown the knowledge you've grown of his word that being your anchor letting that
1:03:43
wisdom of his word knowledge of the spiritual realm anchor you direct you hear his
1:03:49
voice so anyways she she left fful church and she um went to another church
1:03:55
and um I won't go into all the details but she then just started feeling like I
1:04:02
think I made the wrong decision I don't know like Lord if you want me back at fifel church like speak to me Lord and
1:04:10
so all of a sudden she just decided to put on one of my messages and one of my
1:04:15
the one message was about how um it was a message I talked it was where I spoke
1:04:22
on the shepherd's voice and I and and the message I I was saying um you're
1:04:29
called to listen to your Shepherd like she there the Heavenly Shepherd God and then also Shepherd like Pastor like your
1:04:36
pastor your Shepherd your leader of your church that God's called you to be planted in you're supposed to be listening to their voice like the
1:04:42
prophetic anointing is moving through them specifically for your life uh you're not called to listen to millions
1:04:48
of pastors you're not called to listen to Just any Pastor to any leader to any Minister you're called to listen to the
1:04:55
sheph voice your shepherd's voice and so I was teaching on that and then God was speaking to her I was listening to other
1:05:02
voices I was listening to other even the church she went to like she totally knew that they were speaking I mean they were
1:05:08
speaking against the move of God actually so it opened her eyes of like that was not the right voice and that
1:05:13
was not the shepherd's voice um I also was speaking things about like sometimes how you can have that feeling of I feel
1:05:21
like I want to have a mentor close to me close like that can talk to me all the time if that's not what God's will for
1:05:27
you is because that's not necessary many times you can have a spiritual Mentor like right now I'm mentoring you all I'm
1:05:33
literally looking at your questions right here and mentoring you and even if I didn't ask answer your direct question
1:05:39
God knows prophetically what you need and can cause me I've had so many people share with me like they needed the word
1:05:44
from Wednesday like some of you here Miriam shared like wow like the the
1:05:51
message like was for her like she almost made a bad decision that could have led to just out of God's will perhaps but
1:05:59
but hearing hearing that word spoken God spoke through her you know so and it's
1:06:04
just so beautiful because it's it's like God's like okay Miriam needs to hear my voice so I'm gonna put I'm gonna speak
1:06:11
to you Katherine me um to speak this message today and it's for miam and I
1:06:16
also see this person who's struggling with this issue too and this she needs this word too and he needs this word too
1:06:21
my son needs this word too and my daughter here she's going to need this word next week and my son here is going to need this word tomorrow and my
1:06:27
daughter over here is going to need this word uh two months from now my son over here is going to need this word for a year so this word is very important for
1:06:34
their lives like you know so um yeah so
1:06:39
I was so she actually that's part of what made her leave fivefold church was she was feeling this desire like I
1:06:45
really want to Mentor in person and then she got the mentor and ended up being like a disaster like she she knew she
1:06:52
was like actually spiritually on a higher level like the Mentor wasn't in the new wine at all and so it was just a
1:06:58
disaster for her with that situation so but I was saying in the message sometimes God can or the devil can use
1:07:04
the angel of Light can come like you need a mentor like it sounds like a good thing in person and he can use that to
1:07:10
pull you away from your Shepherd um and that's literally what happened to her so she tunes into this message and God led
1:07:17
me to speak this message recently you know when she needed that and so it's
1:07:22
like God was like I know my daughter destiny like it's being L as straight by the angel of Light so I'm speaking my
1:07:29
word to Catherine now you know my Apostle my leader of fifel church and um
1:07:35
this is for Destiny and and other people you know um and so and there was more
1:07:40
there was more things she literally showed video clips of things that I was preaching on two different days that was
1:07:46
literally the word of God that brought all this Clarity to her of her confusion and how she was led away from by the
1:07:53
angel of Light and now brought back um so I give that example to answer your
1:08:00
question you know she actually asked to God she asked God how or or Lord if I'm
1:08:06
supposed to go back to fivefold church give me uh you know speak to me so God
1:08:12
didn't give her a vision God didn't give her a feeling God didn't give her all like Signs something that just like
1:08:19
appeared um God can use those things God can use those things you know what I mean but I'm saying the main principle
1:08:24
the main way especially to make sure we're especially if we're in a sensitive place where the angel of Light has deceived us before God's going to go to
1:08:32
his main principal way of speaking which is in his word and his Rama word through
1:08:37
your leader because it's prophetic anointing that comes it's a God as I said God's Lally like I know my person
1:08:44
my child here my child here my child here needs this word so I'm telling my leader to speak this now and it's like
1:08:51
you you can trust that it's like very simple like I'm telling you this word right now and you don't have to like go pray about it you don't have to go like
1:08:57
was that really from God or is that just Katherine's feelings Apostle Catherine's feelings well you you know that I'm
1:09:05
truly an anointed servant of God like God's LED you to be planted here you know and so you have that like that
1:09:12
trust that God wants you to have like this is God's word coming forth and so
1:09:17
it's very simple and even that's how it's been for me it's been so simple I don't have to like stress what is God
1:09:24
saying I've never been that way since I've been since I've had my spiritual father it has been simple to hear God's
1:09:31
voice it has been easy to hear God's voice I have a question I ask him God speaks through him you know and
1:09:39
it's brought so much Clarity to me with hearing the Holy Spirit and not looking
1:09:45
the wrong way at signs and um not saying God give me a vision God give me a dream
1:09:50
God does give me dreams sometimes but um not like pushing God to speak in certain
1:09:57
ways cuz I'm confused and I want it to be really obvious so simple the the god way the
1:10:05
god the God's way is amazing is simple you know so yeah that's the answer I
1:10:11
mean like look how God spoke to her and like if she had um you know renewed her
1:10:17
mind with the word of God maybe you know like knows knows what she knows now like
1:10:22
she's learned now how to hear God's voice and and how the angel of Light Works can deceive so if she could redo
1:10:30
it she would know okay I'm having these feelings but I renew my word with these things that I've taught that I've taught
1:10:36
which I've just shared earlier um in the beginning of answering this question right and so you anchor yourself on on
1:10:44
those true words you know are from God instead of relying on your feelings and try to discern your feelings and
1:10:51
thoughts that's the dangerous place right and so the places that God spoke
1:10:57
to her through all of that all that situation was the Rama word of God coming through her
1:11:04
Shepherd like every time that's that's and that's what what would have kept her also from being led astray by renewing
1:11:10
her mind with the word of God that came forth you know so that's that's the main way you know so if you're worried about
1:11:17
like being deceived by the angel of Light you probably need to stop focusing on feelings and signs so much um and
1:11:28
focus more on wisdom on using your wisdom on using what you've learned what you know to be true and applying that to
1:11:36
the situation and then in some situations you do flat out need to ask a question sometimes I need to ask my
1:11:43
spiritual father but so much of the time I've learned so many things through my spiritual father that I know what to do
1:11:48
I have the wisdom for what to do of how to respond in the situation of what God is speaking in this situation
1:11:55
sometimes you do need to ask that's why I have these subscriber q&as um that's why I make myself available on email for
1:12:02
those questions that need to be asked as I shared it is we do I I don't I don't
1:12:07
have the capacity to to spend my whole day answering emails and I have so many disciples we have 88,000 subscribers on
1:12:15
YouTube alone so please use wisdom with asking questions but I just like don't
1:12:21
ask you know don't don't spam my email ask when you know like this is a
1:12:30
question I need to I I I must ask Apostle Katherine you know um and also
1:12:38
just if you don't get a response it could be that got it's not a question you need answered right now or it has
1:12:44
been answered already in messages and you need You' already have it and you need to renew your mind um but I just
1:12:51
want to let you know I'm I am available in those in those situations I want to declare over all of you right now I
1:12:58
declare that wisdom would increase in you in jesus' name wisdom would increase
1:13:04

1:13:12

1:13:18
you the time you've taken to learn God's word be disciples that nothing would be
1:13:25
wasted but it would be strong in you it would become
1:13:31
you like it wouldn't just go in an ear and leave the other ear but you would
1:13:39
really grow you would really grow you would grow in wisdom every day and I
1:13:45
release this anointing for this growth to happen for this ability like anything
1:13:51

1:13:58
