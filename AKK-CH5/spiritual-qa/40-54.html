Order in the Church
0:00
in the same way there is order in the church should there be order online in the chat when we assemble together of
0:06
course of course I mean today Church extends to online it absolutely extends there it's
0:14
it's no less church for those who are tuning in online it is just as much
0:20
church and um it's it's you know on a live stream it's
0:27
not anybody's old anybody's like own place or something it's not their space
0:33
to do what they want but it's God's space it's there's athor there's
0:38
Authority there there's the the the kingdom government has its place there so for
0:45
fful Church's live stream my live stream it would be just as if you're going into
0:52
five-fold church um and there's leadership there that God has placed and
0:59
part of having proper order in the church is to respect that leadership and that means simple things
1:05
like not just anyone can stand up in the middle of church and say I want to say
1:12
something God told me to say something right now like God wouldn't tell someone
1:17
to say something at that point in that way because he doesn't go out of his order um and I I did an important
1:24
teaching about order in the church this is so important and this is such new wine I'm telling you this is such new
1:31
wine I'm meaning that so many in the body of Christ don't
1:36
really know true proper order in the church uh so this is such an important
1:43
teaching to watch because many of you may not know this what the order is what God's proper
1:48
order is so go to my YouTube page another time after this live and um
1:55
there's a message called order in the church and I can't remember remember if it's on my Revival Army playlist but I
What is Order in the Church
2:03
note to self it must be added there if it's not added yet so um anyways I'll
2:10
just like share a couple other or one or two
2:15
other certain different examples of what it means to have order in the
2:21
church that extends to online so you know as I shared just right
2:27
now God is order in the church and so God places leadership in in place in
2:32
that church and when it comes to how the the flow of the
2:38
service um what God wants to happen like the worship the word
2:45
offering um announcements like everything God will give that instruction to the leadership to the
2:51
leader of the church and um he won't go against that so um if
2:59
someone feels really strongly I just have a word of the Lord I need to speak right now when you know the order of the
3:05
church you know that's not God speaking that's my emotions that's the angel of Light it could be as the devil as the
3:12
devil can come masquera himself as an angel of Light uh so when you have that
3:17
wisdom you you it helps you actually even hear God's voice and discern God's
3:23
voice versus the devil's voice versus your own self your own emotions so um
3:29
something that sometimes happens in the church out of order is like people in the church uh can just want to just
Authority in Christ
3:38
prophesy to people want to just pray for people um lay hands and cast out demons
3:48
himself but that's not the place at the church is where you are equipped to walk in your own authority in your own domain
3:56
to walk in your own authority in Christ in your own domain or ter territory but your Authority in Christ your domain is
4:03
not the church that you're planted in it would be the leader of the churches that's their domain territory that God
4:10
has given them so that's why at fivefold church you know I I declare the word
4:15
like all demons here must go I don't just pray for like five people and then
4:22
I I say okay everyone needs to find someone to pray for them to cast demons out to get demons cast out of them
4:29
that's not how it works that's not the order and that's not how Authority works that's not how miracles happen miracles
4:35
happen when a person who is Anointed who has Authority in Christ executes their
4:43
Authority in Christ whether it's over one person that they execute it or over
4:48
a million if a million are in their T territory so if a million are streaming or tuning into to this live stream right
4:54
now then technically my domain is reaching cover
5:00
1 million and so if I say every demon must go 1 million people if there
5:08
are 500,000 people that have a demon the demons have to obey according
5:14
to the spiritual laws when I truly have anointing high enough level anointing to
5:22
deal with all the high all the levels of demonic Powers um when that case that's
5:29
how it's that how that's how it works in spiritual realm and that's why when Peter was ministering it says that they
5:36
brought all the sick and demon possessed to under his shadow and
5:41
just by being under his shadow all were healed the Bible says all were healed
5:47
and it it doesn't say you know he needed to assign tons of people to pray for all these people where he was ministering no
5:55
it was just his it was just his him executing his authority that that
6:00
anointing Authority in his shadow like him just walking and walking in his
6:05
authority made all the demons to go so um it is it is out of order to just be
6:11
prophesying to people in the church um unless you have been by leader
6:19
the leadership given authority to let's say preach one Sunday that would be then your Authority
6:26
for that Sunday but otherwise it is absolutely out of order to pray for
Gods power
6:31
people prophesy for people in the church because God has done the work that he's wanted to do through the anointing
6:38
released in his order that day it's not like there's things missing it's not
6:44
like oh he wasn't able to do everything he wanted to do through the Apostle
6:49
Peter that's there the Apostle Peter of today in that service no it's God's power that we're talking
6:56
about not talking about a human's power it's God God's power so that's the
7:01
problem people have in their mind they for they think it's like a human they think like all these people there's no
7:08
way that they could have been reached through just one person it's not about
7:13
the person it's the power of God in the person that's what people miss
7:21
so it is out of or it is absolutely out of order for people in the comment section to be prophesying to be teaching
7:28
to be um it's not domain or time to
7:33
teach um to if someone is says something I didn't catch that scripture I didn't
7:39
catch what was just said or whatever then that can be replied like um
7:47
repeating what has been said or um maybe someone
7:53
saying uh I don't know or or someone saying we don't want demon to come back
8:01
people should be trained on how to maintain their Deliverance someone it's good to reply there is these teachings
8:08
on Apostle Katherine's YouTube page about how to maintain your deliverance things like that are good like repeating
8:15
things like that um that have already been spoken is fine but coming and
8:21
bringing some sort of like new teaching or coming bringing some sort of Prophecy that is out of order
8:29
it come and bringing someone's own like declarations that's that's out of
Is there order
8:37
order so yeah absolutely there should be order in the chat back to that question
8:43
I will say though it's important we have patience uh because online is a whole
8:48
other thing like the nature of it unfortunately
8:54
people with not good motives um
9:00
um feel free not in a good way
9:05
to do or say whatever sometimes because they can do it anonymously you
9:11
know so um you know it's it's different it's different it's different online
9:17
it's like we have to have a special Grace for that and we do have moderators to help help keep order but we do have
9:26
to have understanding and grace and patience for that situation for that reality
9:33
because we don't want to be so strict that babies in Christ just because they
9:39
don't know better are kicked out or you know what I mean we have to have that
9:45
kind of Grace so just kind of have that understanding like this is the nature of it being online that people can kind of
9:52
hide behind the keyboards so um my recommendation is to
9:59
just really try to the the comments are wonderful for
My recommendation
10:04
fellowship and Community it's really great but I would just encourage you to make sure that like if if you're planted
10:11
from afar you know this is your church treat it as that fivefold church is your
10:17
church treat it as that like treat it as if you were coming in person how would you behave you probably wouldn't be on
10:24
your phone looking at the comments on the live the
10:30
teaching so um make sure you know and it
10:36
it it doesn't mean like you can't look at the comments at all I mean you can always replay the teaching as well many
10:42
times but I'm just saying make sure that you renew your mind to this truth like
10:48
this is my church and I'm going to treat it as if I was there in person I'm going to focus I don't want to miss anything I
10:55
want to get every single word that God is speaking to me I don't want to miss anything so um that will really help you
How do I hear Gods voice
11:04
um especially if the enemy is trying to
11:09
like uh bring distraction through in the
11:14
comments how do I hear God's voice in the word of God when I come with expectancy when in the past I come with
11:21
expectancy and the angel of Light would come and bring the wrong Revelation and Lead me
11:27
astray I would say so sometime so so for some there's
11:36
this for some there can be when the angel of Light can come and deceive
11:41
sometimes it can be when a person really longs to hear God's voice
11:47
in a very like tangible way like audibly or you know just very Vivid way when
11:55
when we know God comes in a still small voice actually a majority of the time so
When the angel of light can come and deceive
12:01
many times we really desire for him to not come in a still small voice but in a bigger more Vivid kind of voice and when
12:10
that's really our passion so much and uh we're kind of just staying like kind of
12:16
like stubborn in that area that's sometimes when the angel of Light can come deceiving when the angel of Light
12:21
knows oh they are looking specifically for a vivid
12:27
voice so I'm going to come in this way because their eyes are locked there and they're
12:33
not quite using wisdom they're just kind of like eyes locked I want to hear God in this Vivid voice you know um
12:43
so that being said sometimes a person when they read
12:48
the word can really be wanting so much to hear God in such a vivid Voice versus
12:54
the still Small Voice so
13:00
the wisdom I have for this this situation if you find yourself in this situation like kind of relearning how to
13:06
read the word and how to hear God's voice in the word is don't put so much
13:12
pressure on yourself to hear God's voice in the
13:18
word when you when you come with a pure heart surrendered to God you will hear his voice in the word and many times it
13:25
will be in a still Small Voice there's many times that I'm reading the word that I read the word of God
Revelation is just a story
13:32
and it's not like Revelation Revelation Revelation it's just simply a story in
13:38
the Bible um maybe that I've that I've known well before and then later the Revelation
13:47
comes later a day two days later three days later the story Pops in my mind the
13:55
story of the Israelites complaining about the food that God was
14:01
providing in the wilderness and Revelation just comes
14:07
days later um and so that's sometimes how God
14:13
speaks sometimes we're you're reading the word and it's not like it's not you
14:19
know if you're writing in the journal you might be like I don't know what to write it's just the story that I know that I've heard before and it's
14:26
beautiful and you know but there's nothing like wildly new like that I I I
14:31
don't have any amazing Revelation that I can write in my journal right now that's
14:38
okay that's okay we need to stop putting pressure on ourselves we need to stop putting
14:44
pressure on God to speak in a certain way and read the word out read the word
14:52
of God out of obedience with faith knowing that you are going to hear
14:57
God's voice and you are going to grow in faith just like simply
Revelation will come
15:02
that don't worry about anything else know that some days you'll read it and
15:07
Revelation just revelation will come God will speak to you powerfully just as
15:13
you're reading sometimes that won't happen sometimes it will happen later and um
15:19
even um just even me as a preacher of the
15:24
word there's so many times when I'm just as God's preparing me to teach something
15:32
God will bring to remembrance a story in the Bible um and just give me Revelation
15:39
from that story in the Bible in that moment for that that's connected to the
15:45
message that God wants me to speak so a lot of why God wants us to read the word
15:51
is not so much of Revelation Revelation as we're reading it but to get it in us
15:58
to get the word in us for then later God
16:03
to speak he can speak because we have the word in us and the word is God so
16:10
we're putting God in us so later God says something and he's able to speak
16:16
and we're able to discern and know it's his voice and have understanding because
16:21
of what we've put of him inside of us in the word so um
16:29
that's really important and I I would say that's really important for for people also who struggle to read the
16:35
word maybe sometimes people might struggle to read the word because they may feel discouraged like feeling like they're not hearing God's voice that
16:41
much and sometimes maybe it feels boring to them or something you know and um
16:47
maybe they're comparing themselves to other people and other people are saying whoa this Revelation I just love the
16:52
word of God and and they they feel like sometimes they're just reading a Bible
16:59
story that they've heard of before and it doesn't feel so powerful and that
Stop putting pressure on yourself
17:04
that makes them feel bad about themselves and the the devil is speaking
17:10
condemnation so th this is important for you also to know if that's you stop stop
17:16
putting pressure on yourself stop putting your pressure on God read the word of God out of obedience and with
17:23
faith knowing that you're putting God inside of you as you read and God is going to speak to you through this
17:28
through it whether it's right in that moment or maybe it will be later on but
17:34
it's so powerful what you're doing and it's not about your feelings at all it's about it's about
17:41
just the action of what you're doing it is powerful so just know that okay I just want to go back to the answer or I
17:49
mean the question of order in the chat and everything and I just want to say
17:55
that this kind of this kind kind of um space is a time where I'm telling you
18:02
guys to write comments you know it's kind of like um if we were together in person and um
18:11
it's like a mentorship session you know and so since I'm asking you to write
18:17
comments and everything that's it's like different than at church when it's like
18:24
everyone just be quiet and listen to the teaching you know so I just want to share that it's different in this space
18:30
and even to share testimonies here is good is awesome but at the same time
18:35
there should be order like to not write random like random comments that could
18:41
be distracting from the word that is being preach still in this more kind of
18:47
casual setting of of Ministry of teaching when we are praying for someone
18:53
and do not see something happen when do we rest in the word declared and when do we pray pray without ceasing pray
Pray without ceasing
19:00
without ceasing does not mean repeating the same prayer over and over again but pray without ceasing means constantly
19:07
commune with God be in constant communication with God prayer without ceasing a big part of that is meaning
19:15
your intimacy with God is meaning thanking God is meaning praising
19:20
God uh it's not pray without pray without ceasing doesn't mean the religious way of
19:26
prayer um um repetitive the same prayer over and over
19:34
again so it is important to believe that God has heard your
19:42
prayers it is important a a powerful thing you can do when you're not seeing
19:49
something happen yet is you declare it and then after that you thank God you
19:58
thank God that is done thank you Lord that you have done this thank you Lord
20:04
that I am healed thank you Lord that my family member is coming into the kingdom
20:10
of God thank you Lord for the provision
20:16
so you are still speaking life you are still like
20:23
watering that Prayer by speaking the prayer but saying that
20:30
it is done and thanking God for it there can be times if a long if time
20:38
has passed where Holy Spirit can nudge you to declare again but don't forget
20:43
that you have declared that God is working and for the most part be thanking God your words are so powerful
20:51
so you if you say I declare I'm Healed and then after that you're saying thank
20:57
you Lord for I am healed it's it's just as powerful I mean
I am healed
21:03
you your words are so powerful for thank you I am healed you are speaking the
21:10
spiritual truth it's not God heal me God heal me
21:16
God heal me I declare I am healed thank you Lord I am
21:23
healed there is such power in these words just even thanking God because
21:29
you're speaking the spiritual truth prophesying what is there what you
21:35
believe is there in the spiritual realm rather than speaking what isn't there
21:41
and asking for what isn't there to come you you are saying it is there it is
21:46
there it is there calling it to come from the spiritual end to the
21:53
physical what can be other reasons for not being baptized in the Holy Spirit apart from not being surrendered to to
21:58
Jesus at this point I don't know if God just wants me to be to God wants me to be patient or if something is wrong
22:06
so many times people are baptized in the Holy Spirit but the gift of tongues
22:13
hasn't manifested yet they've received the gift they've received the baptism of the Holy Spirit but the gift and the
22:20
gift is there but it hasn't manifested yet um and so how to see it manifest is to keep
22:28
seeking God stop um putting so much pressure on it and
22:35
thinking too much about it and being worried about it and just focus on seeking God with all your heart when you
22:42
when you focus on seeking God with all of your heart closing every door to the
22:48
devil being fully surrendered it will come don't worry just make sure you're
22:54
position positioning yourself where God's true power is at a church where God's true power is
Im not baptized
23:01
in person or online and it will happen it will come don't think like I'm not
23:09
baptized in the Holy Spirit if you have earnestly desired that and you've been where the power of
23:16
God is and it has been released it has happened but it the gift
23:22
has not manifested yet and that's okay just keep seeking God and it will come
23:30
can less than Abundant Health for a Time be a testing or Wilderness period yeah I actually think I answered
23:37
this on some a similar question on the last live but I'm G to answer this again
23:45
or as well um so sometimes God doesn't heal
23:51
immediately sometimes the healing is taking place in the spiritual realm and it's just his will and the situation
23:58
that it happens over time just like the people who had leprosy came to Jesus he
24:04
said show yourselves to the priests and the Bible says on their way to the priests they were healed so God had this
24:12
it was his will it was his plan for them to not be healed immediately in the presence of Jesus but to be healed
24:19
later um they were healed in the spiritual realm but didn't see it physically till later so in the same way
24:26
that's just how it is today day for some people in some cases that's just how God
24:32
is doing it and many times this is a way that God
24:37
wants to build one's faith God wants to test one's faith if you will to see if
24:43
you will apply what he's the principles he's taught and be obedient and have
24:49
faith and trust him he can use that as a way to test you as a way to strengthen
24:54
you as a way to build your faith that can be the reason sometimes sometimes
Missing a key
25:00
it's just what God's doing there doesn't have to be a particular reason we're figuring it out but that's just what God
25:07
decided to do um and then of course there can be some situations where a key is still a
25:13
key needs to be unlocked still in the spiritual realm as I have a teaching if this is
25:19
your first time here or you're fairly new here I have um very important
25:25
playlists called how to receive compl complete deliverance how to receive and maintain
25:31
Deliverance so I go over so many most of the keys that unlock complete
25:36
deliverance so sometimes people are missing a certain key and that's why but other times it's not that they're missing a key it's
25:43
just God's plan for them to be healed over time it's done in the spiritual
25:48
realm but to see it manifest physically will happen over time sometimes it's God's plan that it will happen layer by
25:55
layer by layer just God's plan and then another another instance can be for the
26:03
purpose of God knowing one's heart and God seeing that they're not that their
26:09
heart has some growing to do and God can see sometimes someone some person will
26:14
be specifically LED uh led to led to go to a Ministry where God's power is and
26:23
and so much so because they really need God's power they need healing they need Deliverance that's a big reason they go
26:29
there and then they're really focused on receiving their healing that's the real thing they love God yes but maybe there
26:37
isn't a complete surrender or complete maturity in the heart so so much of their motive is to receive the healing
26:44
and freedom yes they love God but their number one motive
26:50
isn't to seek God and serve him period their number one motive number one
26:56
number one desire is to receive healing and deliverance and maybe number two to serve God and so even though one loves
Healing and deliverance
27:04
God truly but maybe they're they've not grown to a place where God needs them to
27:10
be so God can see in the spiritual realm that the devil will tempt them
27:15
to to leave the ministry where God's power is once they have received their
27:21
healing and freedom that God can see that sometimes
27:26
and so God is really saving a person saving a person from a life that's where
27:32
they were deceived by the enemy and they're not surrendered to God he's really saving them by not bringing the
27:38
complete healing or Freedom immediately because he sees ahead he sees ahead what
27:44
would happen and so he uses that like desire and seeking for complete healing
27:51
and freedom and them keeping on coming to change them to begin to transform
27:57
them until they are ready they are ready to be completely healed and freed he sees
28:03
that they won't go away once they are healed or freed that's not every situation there's
28:09
many people that can come to the church and they're not not even surrender to God but God's power hits them and
28:16
they're so convicted they're I mean they're so enamored by God's love that
28:22
even though they're a baby Christian they're not going anywhere you know so
28:27
it's it just depends on the situation God sees God knows God sees
28:33
these things that we don't know that we don't see so that's why we just trust him that's why if we don't see a healing
28:38
manifest immediately we don't blame God we don't question God we we just trust
28:44
him we just we just trust him and we just do our part the simple part that we
28:49
have of just believing him and obeying him doing what he has called told us to
28:55
do applying the principles his principles in his word and we leave the rest to him we
How to become a covenant
29:01
don't go and try to figure out we don't go and be consumed with like confusion of why we're not seeing it happen yet we
29:09
just trust him how to become a covenant daughter or
29:15
son to our a covenant spiritual daughter or spiritual son to our anointed and
29:21
appointed spiritual mother or father and not to be so individualistic so it is
29:28
true you know I shared this this past Sunday I taught on this truth that God
29:36
will call some relationships to be Covenant we see I mean a CO yeah to be a covenant
29:43
you know so many relationships are meant to be just seasonal and are not really
29:48
meant to make a covenant so there's power in our words there's power in covenants if you are just throwing
29:56
around Covenants promises it could lead to demonic soul ties it could lead to
30:02
wrong soul ties God didn't intend you to be forever with this person and now you're in a new season of life and this
30:09
person needs to be out of your life in terms of being close to you to go where you need to go but yet because you made
30:18
this Covenant This Promise they're attached to you still so you would need to renounce that and then you can be
30:24
free renounce that and be where the anointing is position position yourself for the anointing is to be free from
30:29
that demonic Soul tie so it's something to take very seriously to speak a covenant to make a promise um let your
30:38
yes be yes let your no be no it's we got to take that seriously as the word says uh but like Jonathan and David God
30:46
called them to be in Covenant God called Jonathan to be beside David for for life for for
30:56
God's purposes to to be done and uh Elisha called was called by God to be in
Elishas covenant
31:03
Covenant with Elijah you know God wasn't wanting Elisha to go and find a different
31:11
spiritual father he couldn't have received the Manel from Elijah if he didn't make covenant he even said I will
31:18
never leave you I will never leave you I will never leave you so that was him making Covenant making a promise and God
31:25
wanted that to take place and that was such a big key of
31:31
um Elisha not being Swept Away by the devil's schemes and Elijah being able to
31:38
be strong and being trusted by God to receive the mantle from Elijah and I
31:44
will loudly and proudly say I will never leave my spiritual father Prophet Dr Jordy I will never leave him I will
31:51
never leave him I will be his spiritual daughter for life so I I proudly excitedly joyfully
32:02
humbly and With Honor say that and I know the importance of that I know the
32:08
importance of that um I do that out of obedience to God knowing that truly the
32:16
anointing in my life the calling in my life would cease if I were to um break that
32:23
Covenant simply because it would be out of God's will simply because it would be out of God's
32:30
will do not twist it do not take it religiously do not do not take it as
32:35
like oh you're saying you need a person to um minister to people you need
32:43
another person or something no no no don't get it twisted this is having to do with obeying God how God has
32:50
principles that principle is so clear in the word of God of impartation of being
32:57
a spiritual son and son or daughter uh Paul says Paul says in the New
One spiritual father
33:04
Testament you have many teachers but you only have one father I became your
33:09
spiritual father in the Lord and I mean if you think about the meaning of father
33:15
or mother you don't change mothers or fathers like right like physical father
33:21
or mother they're your father or mother for life and there's only one one like
33:27
one real one so um if it's biological that's biological
33:34
if you're adopted you definitely consider your adopted father or mother your father or mother and you would see
33:40
the biological one like not as the true father or mother but the adopted one is the true one there's there's only like
33:46
one right so um that's it's biblical it's biblical
33:53
so so yeah um one once God will absolutely call I mean this is new wine
34:00
by the way this is new wine it's it's the Bible but it's rare in the body of
34:06
Christ today but this is what God is up to now in this new move of God in this revival in this end time
34:12
Revival he is restoring the way of his church the foundation the
34:19
principles the structure of how his church should be of how the equipping should take place of how impartation
34:25
should take place of how anointing should flow of what we see in the acts Church he's restoring now and so this
34:31
principle that we see in the acts church that we see with Apostle Paul is he's talking about you only have one father
34:36
one spiritual father I became your spiritual father um that's God is restoring that now so God is absolutely
34:42
going to be speaking this he has been speaking this to to many of you some of you here already um I'm calling you to
34:48
be planted here I'm this is like your your Elijah just like like your Elisha this is your Elijah I am calling you to
34:55
be planted here I'm calling you to be planted here for life this is you've arrived this is your place to grow to
Be obedient
35:03
receive anointing to be equipped to to fulfill your purpose on this earth right here so if and God will make that clear
35:10
he will not be ambiguous about it it will be clear if you have ears to hear if you are surrendered and have ears to
35:15
hear he will make it very clear so if God has made that clear then it is really important to be obedient and say
35:22
yes God yes God I I accept I accept
35:28
what you have called me to here to be planted here I will not leave you you
35:33
it's powerful it's important and it's in obedience to God to to declare those words to speak those words to make that
35:40
Covenant with God God's asking you to make a covenant with him too like
35:45
like like God is saying this is where I'm moving here and I want you here specifically in this place will you make
35:52
a covenant with me to stay here with me here where I am moving and where I'm
35:59
going to be equipping you so that's a one of the things you
36:05
can do to to be Covenant and then the next to to make a to be Covenant sons
36:11
and daughters and then the next question was how to be not so individualistic and a big thing you can
36:20
like instead of being I think the question is saying you know in the body of Christ to today it's
36:27
kind of rare to operate so much as like in Kingdom in Kingdom Kingdom
36:36
order Kingdom of God order um it's rare to have to to to be planted it's rare to
36:43
have a spiritual father or mother it's it's more common to be more of like this individualistic Christian where you're
36:51
just doing your own thing um and not being accountable and just being
36:58
like I'm here with God doing my own thing ministering My Own Way doing
Be humble
37:04
whatever that's more common so how to not be that way how to not be indiv like
37:10
the individualistic way um well a big part is just you know Renewing Your Mind
37:16
with this new wine teaching that I've kind of summarized a little part of it right now but renew your mind with these
37:24
teachings so much of of it is on the Revival Army training playlist on my YouTube page so renew your mind to get
37:30
out of the old mindset the old wine um
37:35
and uh humble yourself be humble be humble and realize that
37:43
um it's important you regularly
37:49
daily operate in your place not outside of your place of being a a spiritual son
37:57
or daughter you know but you are operating in that humble place
38:03
so like if you need to ask a question that you ask a question you don't just
38:08
like do your own thing right um You don't operate out of
38:14
order um and you humble yourself to
38:19
whenever there's like if there's selfish motivations or passions be real with yourself what's
38:26
going on in my heart here what are my motives here am I doing this for this
38:33
selfish motivation if that's what I'm doing I
38:38
have to stop I have to humble myself I need to remember who I am my place where I am
38:46
like my place and not steep outside of
38:51
that and not operate however I want to operate but but humble myself and be in
38:59
my place as a disciple a disciple to not
Do your own thing
39:06
jump to be a teacher when you are a disciple and maybe it's you're calling
39:12
to be a teacher someday don't jump out of there don't jump ahead and step out
39:18
of your place of being a disciple um that that kind of thing is
39:23
what I'm saying and that applies to anything anything with doing the work of God um don't jump out of order but be
39:31
humble clarification someone I was asking what do you mean by doing your own
39:37
thing um I mean like like when God hasn't called you to
39:44
start um publicly preaching or something when
39:49
he's not called you to do that yet um and you just start doing doing it you
39:57
know forgetting that there's order that you are that you have a spiritual um
40:03
parent and something big like that is important to ask to go to I'm talking
40:09
about starting like uh a Ministry um if if one is feeling that
40:16
that unction it it's important to have be be in order in that area that's just
40:24
one example but it can be many different things um just kind of doing
40:30
things uh that should there should be order there should you shouldn't just start it
40:39
um acting as if you're your just not not part of a covering not
40:45
having a spiritual uh parent I don't mean like every little thing in life but I mean when it comes
40:52
to things in Ministry and something you will feel convicted
Discernment
41:00
when you are surrendered you will con feel you will feel convicted is I could give there's so many different scenarios
41:07
but you will feel convicted if you really surrendered to God um this is
41:13
kind of me just doing my own thing operating out of order forgetting that I
41:19
am under a covering have a spiritual mother or father how can I have more discernment I
41:26
I feel like mostly wrong people have been attracted to me like
41:31
people like like friend like people trying to befriend but come with bad
41:37
motives or just bad influences so when you recognize that that means you
41:44
recognize the scheme of the enemy and so it's it's it's it's powerful that you
41:51
recognize that because the Bible says my people perish because of lack of knowledge
41:57
but you know the but the truth shall set you free you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free so God has
42:04
opened your eyes to see a scheme of the enemy so now the scheme can be stopped
42:10
now I mean now the devil can't win because you know his scheme you're aware
42:16
your eyes are open so that's number one that's huge that's big praise God for that number two renounce this renounce
42:25
say I renounce being engaged with the wrong people I
42:30
renounce uh letting people in that ended up being
42:36
bad influences I renounced that and I
42:44
declare that no wrong motive person could come close in my life
42:52
again God help me to see help me to see clearly to have good discernment right
42:58
off the bat to not ever let the wrong person in
Be aware
43:03
close make that your prayer and
43:09
um just be aware be aware and and and just
43:15
be aware not not to have like suspicion over everybody but when you've had this
43:21
kind of scheme happen in your life just don't be sleeping be aware and remember
43:28
that Jesus only kept three very close to him so be loving to everyone be loving
43:37
to everyone who approaches you tries to come close but make the decision
43:42
decision to be strong and put up boundaries Godly
43:48
boundaries um and like know that it's a big red flag when
43:57
people are doing things out of God's order when people are going against the
44:04
new wine when people are wanting to do things their own way and not God's way
44:11
when people are being disrespectful to your leader to where you were planted
44:18
know that that's a big red flag that that's a big big big big big red flag
44:24
things like this um know that it's a red flag when someone's being forceful being
44:31
manipulating uh know that know that and and then be strong in that now have
44:38
confidence now to put up Godly boundaries knowing that you can see the
44:44
red flag you know you know you know this you know this is red flag and so you're
44:49
able to stop it right there you're not allowed to let the enemy go any further
44:54
through this scheme you stand strong in the Lord
I declare protection
45:04
amen and I just want to declare for you and every person who is having this
45:10
issue the scheme of the enemy happen in their life I declare protection to you in Jesus name and I stop these wolves
45:21
predators in the spiritual realm that are trying to P you from God's Will and
45:28
bring distraction I declare them to be repelled from you in Jesus name that
45:33
they couldn't come and touch you that they could not pull you from God's will that they must not disturb you anymore
45:40
in jesus' name and I declare anything in the spiritual realm that people are
45:46
sensing as uh vulnerable as um easy to
45:52
manipulate um anything that demonic forces are sensing or people themselves
45:58
just with bad motives are sensing I stop it now I declare in
46:04
jesus' name that you would be left alone that you would be protected in Jesus
46:10
name and that these wrong people want to keep being gravitated towards you in Jesus
46:17
name and may discernment and wisdom increase in you that you would be able to see in the spiritual realm and I
46:24
speak strength to you to to put up Godly boundaries and to be strong and confident in that in Jesus
46:32
name Godly boundary okay here's an example someone says what's an example of a Godly
46:38
boundary okay so there could be people that want to hang out that want to just be friends
46:44
that want to come close to you that want to hang oneon-one but God is telling you no God is telling
46:49
you I'm not calling you to bring this person close or maybe God is saying you need to keep them at a distance first
46:56
until I can show you if they can come close or not but you can't immediately
Im not calling you to bring this person close
47:02
just let them closely in like this right so what do you do when a person is
47:10
just asking you let's hang out let's hang out oneon-one let's you know do
47:16
that what can you do well you can say I'm I'm I'm sorry I'm so focused on
47:24
serving God and focusing on on on him right now that my schedule doesn't allow for that but
47:32
um I bless you you know you be loving that's just an example just you can say
47:38
you're focus on serving God you're focus on serving him that your life is busy with that right now so you don't have
47:44
time for it it's okay to say you don't and it's the truth too you you can't you do not have time for this person you all
47:52
your time is to be spent with God and is and is to be spent with people that he
47:57
has called you to bring in close only so there's literally not time there there's
48:03
not a place there's not a place for that to take place is is what God's saying to
48:10
you but you say it in a loving way not in a rejection way say it in a kind and loving way because you don't want people
48:17
to um you know not see love through you so
48:23
just be kind and just make make it about that that you are just being obedient to
48:30
God to serve him and focus on him and spend time with just him right now in this
48:37
season how do we balance between imitating you as our spiritual mother and being ourselves so this question is
48:43
concern uh like in reference to um Paul he said to his spiritual children
48:49
imitate me as I follow God or different translations say different things follow
48:54
me as I follow Jesus imitate me as I follow Jesus um follow my example as I
Spiritual children to imitate their spiritual parent
49:00
follow Jesus so this is really biblical um for Spiritual children to
49:08
imitate their spiritual parent this is biblical this is what Paul said because
49:13
this is God has has matured this spiritual parent in the Lord for the
49:20
purpose of equipping them and helping the Believers so like that that's the purpose of
49:26
them being at a higher level you know um being more spiritually mature having
49:33
more spiritual Insight the grace that God has given them is for the purpose to
49:40
equip those under them the spiritual children spiritual Sons and Daughters
49:46
God's people that's that's why so God does it this way he uses people
49:52
so much it's the biggest way he he speaks to his people he one of the big ways he speaks to his people in terms of
49:59
um like uh Insight of the word of God and and and teaching them the the
50:06
spiritual principles and the deeper things in the spiritual realm the big way is it's coming through a vessel
50:11
through your teacher through those God his grace the fful ministry your spiritual parent spiritual mother or
50:18
father um and God also uses vessels to
50:25
just be that example to see this is what humility looks like this is what
50:32
being generous looks like this is what being selfless looks like this is what being compassionate looks like this is what loving your enemies looks like like
50:39
God literally the biggest way he does this is by showing an example for
50:44
someone to see a good example of this is like someone some people don't realize
50:50
really what loving your enemies means really what um being humble means
50:56
they don't know it's to this standard they can try on their own but then if when God can raise someone at a higher
Loving your enemies
51:03
standard more spiritually mature for them to then see oh that oh I need to go even more
51:11
that's really what humility looks like that's really what loving your enemies looks like that's an example like this is God's way just God's way of doing it
51:19
so um that's that's that's kind of how we can make sense of why Paul said does
51:25
that imitate me okay because this is God's main way of um moving on this
51:31
Earth is through vessels speaking on this Earth is through vessels releasing his powers through vessels through
51:37
vessels so um the question was how do we H like how do we balance that I think it
51:45
was like imitating our spiritual father or mother and being ourselves so the
51:52
imitating part is really having to do with Godly character and being a vessel of God Godly
52:00
character and being a vessel of God so the way you should imitate your spiritual parent
52:06
is like the fruits right like in situations where God is calling you to
52:12
be humble you can remember I mean now you have an example this is what humility looks like I've seen it I've
52:20
seen it in the flesh you know I've seen it through my spiritual mother or my spiritual father so in this situation I
52:25
want to apply I want to be like them do it like how they did I wouldn't have gone that far in the past but now I know
52:32
God's calling me to a higher standard because I've I've seen them so I'm going to imitate them in that area same with
52:39
loving your enemies same with loving your enemies
52:47
um like before maybe you would like defend yourself and say this person has
52:53
done me wrong but I bless them and I forgive them you know and to you that was loving
52:59
your enemies but then you've seen a different example through your spiritual father and mother and you see that they
53:05
are letting God fight their battles for them and are literally not playing a part of shining
53:14
any kind of bad light on the person even if they deserve it even if it's the truth what I was saying was
53:23
um loving you you've seen the example of loving your enemies through your spiritual mother or father that um you
53:31
know they didn't defend themselves they let God defended defend them and they didn't speak this person did this but I
53:39
love them and bless them no they didn't even say that because it wasn't their
53:44
job to shine any kind of bad light on them even though it was the truth even
53:51
though they deserved it but it was their job to to just love the person bless
53:58
them and let God take care of Justice Vindication judgment convicting the
54:06
person what all of that um that was God's job and so you saw such love for
54:13
the that love for the enemy that your spiritual father and mother had that they um I mean that they had this like
54:22
compassion for the person that they didn't even want to expose bad that they did to them because they
54:28
just knew that wasn't their place and they only they want they want conviction
54:33
they want they want um repentance for the person they want this person to
54:39
um to succeed in the Lord to be blessed they don't want to cause a huge downfall
54:44
for the person if God wants there to be a huge downfall for the person because of the bad that that person did to you
54:51
that's up to God but we don't want that we want Sauls to become Paul's so we
54:57
don't want to take down you know Saul who was killing many Christians but God
Saul
55:03
loved him so much that he wanted to uh restore and redeem him
55:09
from the the evil person that he was um
55:15
he I mean and when God did that he didn't do this huge shaming thing he didn't do this work I'm going to shame
55:21
you I'm going to say how wrong you were to everybody I'm going to make all of my disciples stop doing the work of God and
55:28
go instead on a campaign with picket signs saying Saul is so evil and he's
55:33
against God God didn't call his followers to do that God didn't do a
55:38
whole someone's this is powerful praise God thank you Jesus this is a word right
55:44
here for somebody to to try to grasp and understand the love that we're supposed to have for our enemies that it is not
55:51
our job to be exposing people that God wants to
55:56
redeem um so God didn't cause this huge campaign to like expose him first and
56:03
then redeem him like no he literally just showed up showed himself showed his
56:09
love revealing himself look this is who I am Saul open up open up your eyes see
56:16
and then he saw and as he saw he was moved to repentance he he was convicted
56:23
and he gave up that evil life completely in one second and God wasn't like well I want to make you pay for this though you
56:30
deserve punishment you you know and then maybe I'll think about redeeming you later after you suffer for a while God
56:36
didn't do that God did not do that and he did so much more evil than most of
56:42
your enemies have done soled and this is what God did right so
56:49
um and instead the next day he goes from killing Christians to now a leader of
56:56
the Christians even being part of one of the disciples being killed he now is
Wild Love
57:02
sent by God to one of the disciples to pray for him open his eyes anoint him
57:08
release anointing to him and and then work alongside him in the
57:15
gospel and to do to preach the gospel to do the work of God and then this guy was
57:21
going to be even like higher above in the spiritual realm in terms of like leadership and Legacy in the body of
57:27
Christ than even this disciple ananas that open that that God used to anoint
57:35
him and open his eyes it's wild the love that that God has for all people even
57:42
people who were doing wrong things right it is wild love it is wild love so
57:47
anyways um you know you you you see now your spiritual father or mother how they're loving their enemies
57:55
by Silence by not exposing them by not shaming them by not defending themselves
58:02
and showing how bad they are and it's true they did bad things but they're not doing that they're loving their enemies they're having that heart of God of I
58:09
want them to be ass Sal apal so I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that they're a Sal to a that they
58:15
come from and that's for me that includes loving them that for me that includes being silent and not speaking all the things and bad things they've
58:21
done to me tell you what I mean I we we have influence and power I
58:29
could I could I could for some people that things have done they've done to me
58:35
I could I could expose I could show to I have I have hundreds of thousands of
58:42
people I could show look this is evidence this is the the proof even not
58:47
just hearsay this is the proof and I I could turn hundreds of thousands of
58:53
people a against someone and cause them to like spew hate on them that's
58:59
horrible that's awful man that's not love that's not love that's not godly love you know
Imitate
59:10
so so when you when you see this higher standard of loving enemies now you
59:15
imitate that so when you have an enemy in your life you're like oh I remember what my
59:22
spiritual mother did or my spiritual father did in that situation that's just like this situation oh I got to do so much
59:30
differently than what I would have done in the past I'm going to instead imitate what they did that's
59:37
imitating this is like in every situation when it comes to um like our
59:42
the fruits of the Holy Spirit like our character our actions our words so how
59:48
you talk to somebody how you minister to them you know maybe you would be really religious before with um
59:55
ministering to somebody maybe you would be preaching religiously like you have
1:00:02
to repent or um say the sinner's prayer or you won't go to heav you know you're just coming in a religious way to
1:00:08
somebody or coming in a way of like coming to a person out of like this
1:00:14
motive of I want to convert them or I don't want them to go to hell I'm going to scare them to not going to hell like
1:00:21
that was the religious heart that was I mean like the heart the religious way
1:00:28
behind you ministering to a person but now you see your spiritual father or mother and how they minister to people
1:00:34
and you imitate that how they speak to people when they Minister you imitate
1:00:39
that um if you're sharing with someone about God and things that you've
1:00:45
learned spiritual things that you've learned spiritual principles that you've learned you imitate how they've shared
1:00:51
the word you don't come and bring your own things but you imitate what they have
1:01:01
taught you don't come and bring your old wine stuff there's new wine being released you just bring the pure new
1:01:07
wine just like your spiritual father or mother brings the pure new
1:01:12
wine how do they act in social media what are they posting about how are they engaging how are they engaging with
1:01:18
politics you imitate that how are they imitating with with
1:01:23
World issues you imitate that you you should imitate in every
1:01:30
way in terms of these like what I'm talking about now um in terms of uh ministering and
1:01:39
godly character and where we put our Focus so all things spiritual you
1:01:48
imitate but your personality is your personality
1:01:54
so I'm really just um very what's the word
1:02:01
animated I don't know I was just born this way God just made me this way we don't have to all be animated like me I
1:02:07
have many faces I don't try to make these faces I it's just natural it's just how I am it's just how I express
1:02:13
myself you don't have to be this way you do not have to have an animated face you do not have to be enthusiastic though be
1:02:21
passionate about the gospel but that could look different for you okay
1:02:28
um you should imitate how you present yourself okay here's another thing your
1:02:33
spiritual father and mother how they present themselves they're put
1:02:39
together how they dress how they carry
1:02:45
themselves how they carry themselves rather than so guys today in the
1:02:52
Q&A we're gonna do I act like this no just carrying
1:02:57
myself even sitting standing how you carry yourself is is part of representing God how you
1:03:05
car yourself right professional um this is serious I'm
1:03:11
treating the work of God seriously I'm I'm fully present right so carrying
1:03:19
yourself in that way imitate that imitate but in terms of like soose
1:03:24
even um looking put together and representing god well but you can have
1:03:31
your own style you don't have to get the whole same clothes same type of clothes same
1:03:37
type of colors or whatever but granted if you are really
1:03:43
into Gothic style that is not godly that's
1:03:50
demonic so you can even learn from even how someone dresses not that you carry
1:03:55
their same style but the the spiritual side of it the spiritual side behind
1:04:02
it God has created man to be man and woman to be woman and so women should be
1:04:10
feminine men should be masculine that doesn't mean that all women we should be
1:04:15
wearing we have to be wearing dresses all of us have to have really long hair all of us have to be wearing jewelry all
1:04:20
the time it and makeup it doesn't and heels no no no no no um but we shouldn't
1:04:26
be masculine for men to be masculine does not mean they have to um have the
1:04:33
biggest muscles and um you know wear the most
1:04:40
masculine clothes they can find but just be Mas don't be feminine don't be
1:04:45
feminine with how you dress with how you care yourself because God has created man to be man and woman to be woman
1:04:53
simply that having nothing to do with style but simply God wants you to be this way and
1:04:59
when you Veer outside of that it's opening up doors of the enemy to influence your identity so that's why
1:05:06
it's important that we even care about these details of even how we dress
1:05:12
represent ourselves so um so yeah like be yourself
1:05:20
with how you dress but still you can imitate as in terms of like how your
1:05:26
spiritual father or mother represents god with how they dress for example um be yourself with your personality but
1:05:34
you know if your personality is like too laidback then then maybe that you need
1:05:39
to alter your personality a little bit to be more Godly in that way right so
1:05:44
that's what I mean so um you don't have to be animated like like me like expressive with my face you don't have
1:05:50
to have the same tone of voice or talk the same way that I do or you know no
1:05:56
have your own personality but be enthusiastic like I'm enthusiastic about God be loving with your
1:06:04
Expressions be um zealous and passionate about God whether you feel like it or
1:06:11
not yeah see so that that's what I mean uh
1:06:17
uh passions you know I love to hike I love nature I love to do adventurous
1:06:26
things I love to kayak to be on a boat to um you
1:06:33
know just travel and do all sorts things like that you don't have to have those
1:06:39
same passions though that's your you have your own passions but granted make
1:06:44
sure your passions are Godly make sure that they are glorifying God and that
1:06:50
they help support what God is calling you to do right like that they are um it's
1:06:58
never an open door of the enemy so like if your passion is playing video games
1:07:04
that's okay just make sure they're not demonic video games and that you're not spending too much time doing the video
1:07:09
games type thing amen modesty yeah that was one of the
1:07:16
words that I meant yeah that's yeah so have your own style but let it be modest
1:07:21
let it be put together let it represent God well I'm going to declare over you all
1:07:28
pray over you all right now I declare that from this
1:07:35
moment wisdom and discernment would increase in you in jesus' name I declare
