Can you be addicted to deliverance
0:00
can you be addicted to deliverance and if so how would one receive True Deliverance um if you mean can you be
0:06
addicted to receiving Deliverance uh there could be people who
0:13
when they have when they have um received Deliverance it was the greatest joy you
0:20
know and the greatest relief post receiving deliverance and um even in the moment
0:28
itself of receiving Deliverance they encountered God so
0:34
powerfully so tangibly and so a person could be addicted to
0:42
Deliverance in that sense like be obsessed with the receiving of
0:48
Deliverance um but we have to realize that we're not supposed to keep on
0:54
receiving Deliverance we're supposed to receive Deliverance be free with the sunsets free is free indeed and then go
1:00
glory to glory with Jesus and walk in His abundant life and though it won't
1:06
look the same maybe the you know we might not be falling back with God's power every day like what happened when
1:14
receiving deliverance we are experiencing Jesus just as much it may
1:19
not be the physical uh feeling but we are experiencing him just as much so one has
1:28
to be mature and and realize this and um be okay with
1:34
this be okay with encountering Jesus however he wants to touch you every day
1:40
um so if it's a less physical feeling that's okay you know you have to make
1:46
you have to be mature and make that decision and um sometimes the enemy can
1:55
sometimes the enemy wants you to stay stagnant and be in this place of keep seeking keep on seeking to Deliverance
2:00
instead of going glory to glory and walking in your walking in your calling
2:06
moving forward from receiving Deliverance because when you before you receive Deliverance you are in the
2:12
negatives in terms of like like you're not living an abundant life you're not even living at zero you're living in the
2:21
negatives when you're oppressed so it's like you know you can you can be
2:27
um you can be living you can be living in
2:33
prison that would be the negatives and then you're set free from
2:39
prison but maybe you don't have hardly any money and
2:46
um you you you're just so you're free but you're not living in abundance
2:52
you're living at zero and you know you're struggling to find shelter or food or any you know a
2:58
job and um maybe friends and family and so like life is zero but
3:05
then you can also live a different life where you have friends and family and
3:11
provision and then that would be above zero Abundant Life so that's how it is in the spiritual realm so if you
3:20
are the devil sometimes wants you to like keep on seeking deliverence even when you don't need it because he
3:26
doesn't want you to go beyond zero he wants you to stay in that negative place so he wants to trap you in your mind to
3:31
think that you are in the negative still and to so just keep seeking in that keep being in that place rather than stepping
3:39
into your calling moving forward walking in uh going in Abundant Life going glory
3:45
to glory um and that's where many many times you have the enemy
3:50
speaking lies in the mind saying you're not fully free you still need more Deliverance there you still need more
3:57
Deliverance um so sometimes times people need lots of Deliverance and it can take several months to receive complete
4:05
deliverance God can decide to deliver layer by layer by layer there can be tons of demons and God decides to
4:12
deliver layer by layer demon by demon over time and God wants to do it that
4:18
way um but then there's other times where a person is free they don't have any demons
4:24
anymore and the demons but the Deon but not demons the devil
4:30
outwardly will send lies in the mind that you can reject but if he wants you
4:36
to not reject them and but and think that they are demons inside your inside you still speaking these things and that
4:42
it's truth I'm still in here like a demon saying I'm still in here you still need
4:49
Freedom um and that is a scheme to get people to keep seeking Deliverance when
4:57
they are already set free um and that's when fake manifestations
5:03
happen because your mind is so powerful so if you can really believe the lies of the devil so strong everything else
5:10
follows as a man thinketh so he is so if you think you're oppressed still even
5:16
though you're not you will you will start to even manifest you will start to appear like you are oppressed um the
5:23
devil can really influence one's mind so much he can influence one's body not
5:29
demons from within but by convincing your mind these things happened these
5:34
things happen so um some people maybe they like to when they feel the
5:40
manifestations they know oh I'm going to be free now you know maybe that's the way the devil like how it was in the
5:45
past maybe that's the way the devil is is lying in the mind so fake
5:50
manifestations start to happen and then one is happy because they know they're going to feel the power of God maybe
5:55
they'll be pushed back by the power of God and they'll be free of this thing that they were struggling with which which they're already free they just
6:01
need to walk in their Authority reject lies of the devil and overcome this
6:07
struggle that we all face as Christians we all face struggles as Christians but they're not all oppressions demonic
6:13
oppressions they're just obstacles they're just attacks of the enemy that
6:19
we can overcome so that's the mistake sometimes is that once a person's set
6:25
free their life isn't perfect they still have to be a warrior of God which means there will be conflict which means
6:31
there'll be obstacles along the way which means there'll be discomfort and so the answer is not seeking Deliverance
6:37
the answer is be stepping up and being a warrior of God and fighting the good fight of faith and going into action in
6:44
the spiritual realm taking your Authority rejecting the lies of the devil and doing it yourself with God's
6:51
power like going into battle yourself walking in your Authority the answer is
6:56
not Deliverance in that case
7:02
so the answer if you are addicted to Deliverance for example like if that is you what I've just described the answer
7:08
to to be free of that uh it's a it's a mind thing it's not free of demons it's
7:14
it's free in your mind the answer is to make the decision to surrender to God to
7:19
receive this this word that I'm sharing when you realize that's me that you will receive it humbly and you will realize
7:27
oh this is what I've been doing um these are the lies i' I've been believing these are the lies I wanted to believe
7:33
you know and you make the decision I surrender to you God I I don't want to do things my own way anymore I surrender
7:41
to you and I reject all these lies that I've been believing the lies I've been
7:47
believing that I that I have more demons all of those lies I reject them
7:52
all simply that's how you are free it's it's about you really just surrendering and making making that decision to
7:58
surrender how much time should we spend believing in God's promises versus living in the
How much time should we spend believing in Gods promises
8:04
present it's a balance it's not like I can tell you one hour of the day should be spent
8:11
on meditating on God's promises and that's it or something like that it's not a specific time but it's really just
8:17
a balance and [Music] um a good indicator to know that you're
8:22
spending the adequate time though is um is is this is that
8:29
is is like God is calling you to do things he's calling you to do things every day to serve him and he wants you
8:36
to give your best he wants you to serve him with Excellence um and he wants you to be
8:42
busy for his kingdom for the most part so uh you should M you know you
8:51
shouldn't be daydreaming too much that it's taking away time from what God has
8:57
called you to do but at the same time we we have to look
9:04
ahead we have to um be ready to move fast be ready
9:10
when God wants to move we got to move you know which means so so so part of
9:16
being ready is remembering the promises remembering the
9:21
promises um like even for me I know the promises that God has made me and Asel
9:28
church and Us in this end time Revival as I shared we haven't seen hardly
9:33
anything yet just a tiny glimpse so I know in my life like I look back at um I
9:40
look back at 2021 when Revival broke out and if
9:46
you could see my life in 2020 and even early 2021 before
9:53
March it's the month it's the three-year anniversary month of the first of the Revival breaking out with the first
Remembering the promises
9:59
demon cast out first person set free at fivefold in my Ministry in at fivefold church in the park praise
10:05
God March 21st 3 2 one and demons go out on three Hallelujah so
10:13
prophetic um so when you look at my life
10:18
on the first couple months of of um
10:23
2021 demons don't always go out on three I'm just saying sometimes that's the way that God leads me to cast out demons is
10:30
by exerting my authority in that way on three you must leave but yeah 321 321 is is the first
10:38
day is the is the day that the first demon was cast out um at Five Church
10:44
praise God um but if you look at my life in early 2021 and the years
10:51
prior and you compare it to my life
10:57
specifically the fall The Following fall when I was traveling constantly even one day in
11:05
the fall I ministered in four different cities in one week different Revival
11:10
events and then church on both of the Sundays or Sundays on the outskirts of that that
11:17
week um if you look at my life it is shockingly different the contrast it is
Be content
11:24
shockingly different and um I shared recently at church that even when you want the
11:31
promise to come you you have to make the choice to be
11:37
content with God and that's a good thing so you want the promise to come but you're in the wilderness maybe and
11:42
things are going slow and they've gone this way for several years and there will come a point where you have to
11:48
choose to be content you have to choose to like fully accept that season and fully accept where God has you there and
11:54
so if that means it's like really slow and mundane and not much as
11:59
happening what real surrender to God means like you fully accept that like you choose to be content and you know
12:07
you just you just fully accept where God has you and when you do that when you do
12:13
that surrender you find contentment and that can even become comfortable I mean you
12:19
you we adapt we we truly adapt I mean as humans as we ad we adopt and with God we
12:25
can adapt it even more like we can um just find contentment anywhere in any
Be ready
12:33
circumstance anything you get used to is truly comfortable and something new can be
12:40
jarring even if it's like what you want it can still be like a shock to the system it can even be a little
12:46
uncomfortable you know because it could be stretching it could it could it could require a lot of like like more faith
12:53
and and boldness and and everything stretching so so
13:00
anyways the promises that God has made me still that have not come to pass yet and um I realize that there will be this
13:09
change in life again for my life even now like there will be a real big
13:15
change and so I realized that I should prepare myself for that so I'm fully
13:20
ready when it comes I don't know the day or the hour when it's going to come just like I didn't know the day or hour back
13:26
in 2021 when that crazy change came and I had no idea it was going to be such a fast change I had no idea whenever I
13:32
imagined the promises like those promises I really thought it was going to be more gradual especially on the
13:37
especially according to the PACE that things had taken already it felt like we were going backwards many times so to
13:44
like go jet speed was something I hadn't predicted you know imagined so um so I
13:51
prepare myself in my mind I'm like I want to I need to be ready for when this comes and I'm hungry for the promises
13:58
that have not been fulfilled yet to come and I want to Value them as much as
14:05
possible which means that when they come to be nothing but joyful and you know
14:11
not let anything take away from that no complaining no complaining even in the mind you know um be ready be you know
14:19
prepare my mind like if things change drastically and it requires like less sleep or something sometimes or
14:27
um you know don't get to do the things that I like to do now because of the lifestyle change that will have have to
14:34
happen um you know I'll be okay with that I'm I'm preparing myself you know
14:42
what I mean so preparing for the Promise by thinking about it is important so
14:49
that you're ready well number one that you don't forget about it but also that when it comes you're ready you're like
14:54
yep I've been preparing for this I'm ready for this so nothing's holding you
14:59
back when it comes and no lie of the devil can try to take you from it or something when it comes um you're not
15:06
stuck in yesterday you're ready to move towards today and tomorrow so it is important to think of
15:14
the promises in that regard uh but so so what you should do is not not not think
15:20
about the promises in this like [Music]
15:26
um depressing way like the promises aren't here yet when will they come I
15:35
really wish the promises were here they're not here now like instead of thinking about the promises in that way
15:42
instead think of that think of them in a preparing yourself way and um yeah in a
Thank God
15:50
preparing yourself way and and and also a way of thanking God for what's to come
15:58
and and praising him for such a big part of my prayer life
16:03
is like thanking God for what he's doing behind the scenes that I'm not aware of
16:09
that's go that's that's preparing the promise to come when things seem mundane and things it seems like the promis is
16:15
delaying I remind myself God isn't like doing other things
16:22
and forgetting this it's not like the promise is delaying because God's like
16:28
not doing things no God is actually doing so many things behind the scenes
16:34
every day to prepare to make a way for this promise to come to pass he's
16:40
literally bringing the promise to come to pass right now by doing things in the spiritual realm he's he's moving things
16:47
he's he's if the promise coming to pass requires a person's obedience to God in
16:55
this he's sending people dreams he's speaking to them he's you know um he's
17:01
literally doing all these things that I have no idea what it is but he is doing things on my behalf to make this promise
17:09
come to pass so I I thank God for that when I don't see the Promise yet and it seems like a while it's taking I I renew
17:16
my mind and I thank God thank you Lord for the things that you're doing behind the scenes I remind myself God is
17:24
bringing this promise to come to pass now we're not even it's not like I'm sitting here and God is sitting here and
17:30
we're waiting God is on the move with this promise right
17:37
now I will also say um so I just want to give like one little indicator if you're
17:43
spending too much time thinking about the promise like probably just like longing for it you know you're spending
17:49
too much time longing for it uh where it's not really beneficial for you to be thinking about the promise like that in
17:55
that regard um so something I've noticed that I've learned with God is
18:02
that he wants us to be kept busy I mean like example for me there's so much work
18:07
that he wants me to do for him every day this is true for everybody it's going to look different in different seasons for
18:12
me there's so much work he wants me to do for him every day and um I'll notice that on days
18:20
when if I'm waiting for the promise and it's taking a while and maybe it's a it's a difficult season
18:29
with with religious religious Giants and attacks
Work of God
18:34
of the enemy and they're they seem more like in the Forefront you know these attacks and things if it's like that you
18:41
can naturally like H just feel longing for the promise to come and but then if
18:48
you're in that same season but then there's a day that's you're it's busier you're doing
18:54
more for the work of God you there's not time to even think about those those things so I found you know make sure
19:01
that you're not neglecting doing the work of God because doing the work of God is a place of
19:08
Grace uh where Joy comes amidst persecution amidst attacks of the
19:16
devil um you know when you're doing the work of God you're focused and you you don't have time to be thinking about
19:22
other things and so when you don't when you when you when you don't work forgot as
19:28
much when you allow your thoughts to just go it causes you many times to be
19:36
thinking negatively and you just feel down you don't need to be feeling down you can be doing what God's called you
19:42
to do he he's providing Joy there he's providing um focus there it's it's a
19:49
helpful way to because we're we're called to to set our mind on on the things of the spirit we're called to
19:55
think about whatever whatever is pure admirable worthy of Praise we God calls
20:00
us to do those things but when like attacks come when persecution comes it's
20:06
more of a challenge to be eyes locked on what we're supposed
20:13
to be thinking about the good things God I mean it's like it's loud in your ear you know like the attacks of the enemy
20:19
is like screaming loud so you can have your eyes like this but it's screaming loud in your ear you know um and so it's
20:27
just hard to stay laser focused but but that's why I say what doing the work of
20:32
God is an amazing Supernatural Grace there um because it like really helps
20:38
you to block out the negative voices and just stay on the good and be immersed in
20:48
the good on God and his kingdom and all of all of things good in his kingdom all
20:53
things all things beautiful so remember like if you're starting to feel like bored waiting and
21:03
longing and you you find yourself kind of feeling down because of
21:10
that there's probably things that you could be doing for God that you're not doing remind yourself I don't need to be
21:15
in this down place I can but I but but the only way I will get out of this is by doing what God has asked me to
21:21
do so I got to do it I got to remember to do it I got to remember to not slow down but keep this pace staying focused
21:28
on God keep doing the work of God um there can be some people that just don't
21:34
understand so we have to have that understanding and not and not and just realize that not everyone will
21:40
understand even if we give an answer that they like May approve of or something they still might not grasp it
21:45
because we are in the new wine new wine in every area when Jesus
21:52
came he came and did things a different way than the the church people of that
21:58
time did things and it and and the people in the the Church of those days
22:05
well it was the the Pharisees the it was the religious leaders the the synagogues the temples but that is is
22:13
really today churches today CH church leaders currently in place
22:20
today um with tradition and religion so much religion so the reason that certain
Churches today
22:29
um churches have certain structures and uh protocols and things a lot of it
22:36
is actually built on tradition it's not actually built by the spirit of God and
22:42
many times not even in the word of God like the way they do things in the the way that they do things in church like
22:48
what's become so common like so many churches for example take communion like
22:55
once a month but never in the Bible does it say take communion once a month but
23:01
like if you if you asked anyone that goes to those churches is it in the
23:06
Bible that we take communion months a month they would probably say yes or they would probably or even if they it
23:11
wasn't asked they would just think oh yes we do communion once a month yeah because it's in the word like
23:16
it there's a blurred line I mean there's between tradition religion and the word
23:24
of God it's like it's meshed together
23:29
where people don't realize that they're doing things not led by the spirit of
23:35
God and unfortunately like the Blurred Line there's like this blurred line
23:41
they've meshed together like religion tradition that didn't ever come from the spirit of God and whenever you do things
23:46
religiously it's a trap it's a it holds you back from experiencing the spirit of
23:51
God so having religion is dangerous it it's it's dangerous like
23:58
like even if it's just doing something just out of tradition repetitively can
24:04
be dangerous because it's it's keeping you like we must do things like this when God is saying I want to do
24:10
something outside of the box over here and you can't hear God speak this because
24:15
you're marching along the path of religion eyes locked on
24:20
tradition God speaking this and you're like you know that's what I mean
24:26
how it can be dangerous so um so like when Jesus came there's so
24:33
many things he did differently so many it wasn't just like one or two or three things and he came with new wine and
24:40
that's the big meaning of new wine coming in a new way um and and and specifically coming how the spirit of
24:47
God wants to move versus doing things a certain way which
24:54
wasn't even how God wanted to do these certain things the new wine is is God moving in a new
25:02
way but it's really like he's like outside of the box where he always wanted to go if that makes sense so it's
25:08
like I can't move here in this old way you won't let me I'm moving I'm finally
25:14
able to move now through Jesus I'm finally able to move now and it's looking new and it is new but it's not
25:22
like today I just decided to move in a new way no I've been wanting to move this way all this time but you wouldn't
25:28
let me like that's Jesus you know so the new wine is is not
25:34
like Jesus waking up one day waking up doesn't sleep but Jesus one day just
25:39
being like I'm gonna just do everything different in the church I don't want to
25:44
do things this way in the church anymore no Jesus has been wanting to do things a new way I mean this way for a long time
25:51
but it's new to everybody else you know that so um so anyways like
25:58
what God is doing right now is so similar to like when Jesus came and so
26:04
many things were different so this new wine is not not
26:10
just anointing is here and demons are being cast out now and we embrace the apostles and the
26:18
prophets the whole fful ministry that's not the only part of what's new in the
26:23
church today there's so many different elements where there is where there has
26:28
been religion and tradition and no spirit of God and God is now and that
26:34
that comes to church structure too in terms of like church structure
26:40
even and how church operates and Leadership
26:47
so it goes in all those areas so so now in this new wine holy spirit is leading
26:53
how he wants to do things holy spirit is leading how he
26:59
wants to do things at fivefold church in the future we will have several leaders we will have we will have prophets
27:05
evangelists pastors teachers other Apostles this is what my spiritual father's Church looks like there are
27:13
several Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers they have other services during the week and the other
27:21
ministers are ministering and they're casting out demons and they're operating the prophetic anointing
27:28
they're operating just as like doing the things that that that that my spiritual
27:33
father Prophet Dr jvy is doing in terms of walking in the power of God releasing miracles to people and preaching with
27:39
power and authority but that church has been around for several several several
27:45
several years right now at fivefold church we are still laying the foundation now remember with Jesus uh
27:53
one one day is like a thousand years a thousand years can be like a day
27:58
so even though fful church has been technically around since
28:06
2017 um so that's several years but the foundation is still being
The anointing
28:13
laid because the way the foundation is being laid like it's still in the beginning phases of God building the
28:21
church because the way the foundation is being laid has to do with the people
28:28
growing the people staying and growing so that they can become
28:36
leaders We cannot put just anyone in the place of leader with the way that the
28:43
devil hates the anointing a person who is established as a leader a person who is is Anointed as
28:51
a minister has to be ready to step on on
28:57
to the front lines with a big old Target on the back and be ready for the attack
29:06
of the devil like they could not imagine and they will have Victory and it is
29:13
will be glorious Victory Hallelujah but I'm speaking this from experience the
29:18
attacks that I've gone through the persecution I've gone through I could not have imagined and I've had Victory
29:24
through them all through Christ and I've grown closer to Jesus through them all and I've seen Glory upon glory in my
29:31
life and Abundant Life increase in my life through it all so there's no complaints but I'm just real with you
29:37
the attacks of the devil upon my life once like it was time for me to be anointed as an apostle and especially
29:44
when it went to the public platform of the world those
29:50
attacks I couldn't even imagine you know and so I had to be ready for that before
29:55
God like put me as an apostle as a leader in a public platform of the whole
30:04
world it was 4 and a half years 4 and a half years from me God
Gods timeline
30:13
needed to take me through 4 and a half years preparing me if he only took me
30:21
through three and A2 years I wouldn't make it I would have given up it would have been it could have been Destruction
30:27
for the kingdom of God we need to go glory to glory to glory and Higher and Higher and Higher we don't want to be
30:33
stuck we don't want to go backwards so therefore we got to go with God's timeline when it comes to everything he
30:40
wants to do like in his church when it comes to him raising up and anointing more leaders to minister um more
30:47
services leading uh different ministers leading different services and um things
30:52
like this Bible studies things like this it has to be in God's
30:58
timing and remember a day for God can be a thousand years so and for us it may
31:03
seem slow but this is God's timing he knows what he's doing yeah so um right
31:10
now in terms of uh in terms of um like church structure and Leadership uh you
31:18
know how I am the one ministering every time I am the only official uh five-fold
31:24
Minister anointed established as of now that's just how God wants to be that's
31:30
his timing and it's just the building of the foundation season and it's it's okay
31:36
for it's it's all that is needed for this season and we will we will change as time goes on it will be different as
31:43
time goes on um when you see Jesus sending the apostles out to minister he
31:48
sent the apostles out and then as you at first first the apostles were they were
31:54
sent out they were sent out to plant churches to establish churches and um as
32:00
time went on we see the other parts of the fivefold ministry being added we we see evangelists we see pastors we see
32:05
teachers but we don't see them in the beginning of the acts church
32:13
when the acts church was just beginning it was just the apostles being sent Apostles sent out here Apostle sent out
32:19
here so that's it's it's biblical it's
32:25
biblical this new wine the new wine way the new wine Church structure and
32:30
everything that God is doing right now and this isn't
32:38
typical Church in every regard when it comes to structure and and all of that
32:44
Traditions traditions of like leadership and everything like that it is not
32:49
typical but God doesn't want it to be there's so much of that not saying that like every church is wrong with how they
32:58
have their structure and Leadership I'm not saying that but I'm saying the status quo if we're talking about like
33:05
the status quo main way has religion has
33:11
tradition doesn't have new wine and we must have the new wine in every area not
33:17
just when it comes to casting out demons we must have the new wine in every area of our lives of
33:28
Ministry of Church of order in the church so listen the truth of the matter
33:37
is a lot of people won't get it a lot of people won't understand it the scripture
33:43
I read this past Sun Sunday is a scripture that I keep in my heart all
33:48
the time is what you should keep in your heart all the time to help you rem to
33:53
help you understand why people don't understand things um and keep you at
Spiritual meaning
34:02
peace in that regard and keep you from trying to force something in terms of
34:08
forcing someone to try to understand something so um the scripture I read was this past
34:16
one of the scriptures I read this past Sunday was to the Natural
34:22
man the things of the spirit are foolish
34:27
so if you aren't spiritual meaning if your eyes haven't opened up to the new wine if your eyes haven't opened up
34:35
spiritually the things of the spirit are foolishness so that could be so many
34:41
different aspects that could be the fact that God can use women to cast out
34:47
demons to be an apostle to be a pastor to be a leader of a church that's foolishness if your eyes aren't open up
34:53
to the spiritual truth that there is no longer no male or Fe female in Christ
34:59
there's no longer um free or slave male or female we are all
35:05
one God has poured out his flesh upon all people men and
35:11
women and when your eyes open up to the scriptures that people speak about um Paul saying women should be silent and
35:18
everything he was speaking to about disorder in the church he was speaking to women who were being disorderly and
35:25
and bringing distraction in the church he wasn't speaking to every women as if
35:30
women in their DNA didn't carry what was necessary for
35:36
God to move through them in a way he can move through a man that he that he
35:42
couldn't move through them to to lead his church lead people be a pastor
35:49
be an apostle no humans male or female we're just vessels and God can do whatever he wants to do through us so if
35:56
we will Just Surrender there's nothing that holds God back there's nothing that God can't
36:01
do he can do anything and he wants to do everything I mean he wants to do he
36:09
wants to lead his people he wants to to Pastor through men and women so if your
36:17
eyes are not open up to the spiritual truth that we need Apostles and prophets
36:23
in the church today that it says in Ephesians 4 that that we will have this equipping of the
36:30
Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers until we come to full completeness wholeness in Christ as a
36:37
body that can't happen until Jesus returns so that means we must have all
36:43
of these offices to equip it offices of ministry to equip the body we must
36:48
otherwise will be malnourished spiritually we will not be equipped properly so but but many people's eyes
36:55
are not opened up to that Revelation from that from Ephesians 4 and throughout the whole new testament when
37:02
when when it comes to speaking of Apostles and Prophets and fful Ministry um some people do not their eyes haven't
37:09
been opened up to that true Revelation and so they will see people they will
37:14
see Apostles up today prophets today they will call them false they will say they're not really true we don't need
37:20
them it's foolishness to them in other words um and so every aspect of the new
37:29
wine the new wine that God's bringing in every area in in terms of how the church
37:35
church order Church structure how to do Church how to minister if their eyes
37:40
aren't open up to the new wine if they're not open to be childlike and receive the new wine revelation of why
37:48
things are done this way what I just shared right now what I shared is what I
37:53
shared about church order what God is doing now in terms of church order order and structure and how it is biblical and
37:59
how it is new wine if their eyes aren't open up to receive that like that truth
38:06
that Revelation it will be foolishness to them so um if they aren't open to to
38:14
learn to receive the new wine don't force it and don't be discouraged that
38:20
they don't get it God will only reveal these things to the humble that's what he said to he said to the disciples I pr
38:27
he said to Jesus after the disciples came back from casting out demons for the first time I praise you father for you've hidden these things in other
38:34
words spiritual Revelations you've hidden these things from those who were
38:39
proud and know what else but you've only revealed it to those who have humbled themselves like
38:46
children so you have to I'm telling you this is the only way you will make it and be strong and be who God has called
38:51
you to be in this revival in this end time Revival Army you have to care carry this in your heart this
38:58
scripture that the things of the spirit are foolishness to the carnal man the carnal mind you you have to
39:06
carry it in your heart people won't get it people won't understand it is fool
39:13
what I see and know as truth is foolishness to them is is a step further
39:20
than they just don't understand it is foolishness and that's why you see so many people saying this is wrong it's demonic when they talk about Jesus in
39:28
the in the in the scriptures that he's cast he's using he's using demons to cast out demons and they're so convinced
39:34
that he is demonic that he is a false prophet they are seeing Jesus as in all
39:39
of his ways as foolishness so that's what you see today you see the new wine doctrines the
39:47
new wine Revelations the new wine ways of doing things as a Believer
39:54
as a minister as a church you see people who don't have the
40:00
spiritual eyes open you see them call it foolishness you see them call it demonic
40:05
so you can't let that get to you you have to be mature and realize yeah of
40:12
course the Bible says this if your spiritual eyes aren't open it's going to be foolish of course I'm not bothered
Spiritual maturity
40:18
that they think it's foolish what I believe in the Bible says that I'm not bothered of course I'm expecting this
40:23
you know you have to be mature in that way or you'll be pulled here and there
40:29
you'll be drained you'll be distracted and you could be pulled away so
40:37
important that you that you grow and you mature in this area with this like
40:42
carrying this truth in your heart that's the importance of um of trusting
40:48
leadership as I shared this past Sunday the message I shared if you didn't see it please make sure you go watch it but
40:53
um God calls us to be planted in a church where he's called you to be planted in and when you are planted
41:00
there you you don't have to figure everything out you don't you just need to rest and trust trust God and trust
41:08
your leader you will receive new
41:14
revelations in this revival you receive new Revelations that you didn't hear before you didn't know before and it's
41:20
for you're supposed to be like a child and just receive them you when God calls you when God
41:26
call C you to be planted somewhere it's because you've seen the fruit so when you've seen the fruit when you've seen
41:31
the fruit you can trust you you're called to you called
41:38
to trust obey not to figure everything
41:44
out Hallelujah can you talk about how to be submissive in marriage when our spouse has many open doors and believes
41:51
many religions are the way to God so and as I shared last last week
41:59
last live last Wednesday I shared a message how to love God more than
42:04
anybody this is something prophetic that God is speaking right now as I even spoke about it some in this live he's
42:10
speaking this in this season right now he's he's bringing testing right now testing if if you will
42:17
for all of you if you will love him more than anybody we're called to love him more than our
42:23
spouse and that will especially be tested when your spouse when your spouse
42:29
doesn't believe fully in Jesus if your spouse is surrendered to
42:34
Jesus if you're equally yolked and your spouse believes in Jesus and surrender to Jesus then loving God first will not
42:41
be so much of a challenge you'll be like on the same page with it and you you can help each other out in that
42:47
area um like when one of the one of the spouses says like one of I mean one of
42:54
you says like you were maybe you're supposed to do you were you plan to do something together the two of you or something
43:00
and but your spouse says God want I need to spend time in the word right now or something or God's calling me to serve
43:06
him in this area right now and so that means you can't have that time together
43:12
that you plan to spend together doing something maybe you're looking forward to but then the spouse because they're
43:20
on they're equili they're on the same page and they want to love God first and they want their spouse to love God first but more than them
43:26
then they're like encouraging like yes okay if God wants you to do that yes do
Love God first
43:33
that I want you to do that you know let's put God first so it's not as much
43:39
of a challenge but it is is going to be a big challenge um and it's a way that
43:46
God can God can use it to refine you when your spouse isn't surrendered
43:54
to Jesus God God God will use it for good but it will be a challenge we all
43:59
have different challenges we all have different ways that God chooses to refine us so that so I say that so you
44:04
don't like get discouraged or regret you know but that you see the
44:11
beauty and good in it but yet you you have to realize like
44:17
when when when we're called to be submissive to the husband it's it's it's written it's intended for an equally
44:24
yolked marriage
44:29
so um it's definitely not written in the word you know to be
44:36
used as like whatever a husband says like if they don't give their if they're
44:42
if they're going against God but they're telling you to do this you need to do it because you need to be submissive no no no no no no no no so I think just
44:50
knowing that will really help and bring a lot of clarity first of all
44:56
so but the way you can still see this is if if it's being respectful and
45:05
honorable to him but it's not going against God so in areas where you can be
45:11
respectful and honorable to him um and
45:17
maybe even something like you want to eat some W for dinner but he wants to eat somewhere else or something but you
45:22
are just let's go where you want to go something like that that's where you can be
45:29
submissive but not in any regard when it comes to following
45:36
God so if the spouse is asking you to do something that's contrary to what God's
45:43
asking you to do you can't you you have to obey God you can't obey the
45:49
husband you have to choose to obey God could having the desire to serve
45:55
more and at a higher level of Excellence be influenced by the enemy if God could be calling you to do other things or is
46:01
that desire of God if you have a desire to serve God and he's he's definitely
46:09
calling you to serve him so if you have especially in you got to look at what's
46:14
most important in this world what's most important in this world the biggest thing that God's calling you to do the
46:21
biggest thing that God's calling you to do is to I mean this like this the greater
46:31
work of God the greater work of God what I mean is like as a body not as an
46:38
individual sometimes we can be self- focused
Self focused
46:44
like okay just here's an example okay so [Music]
46:53
um when I wanted to be a singer I wanted to be a Christian singer and I was like
46:59
I want to be a light for Jesus which was so beautiful and pure and great desire I want to make music that's I want to do
47:05
pop EDM music I wanted because like I I liked I remember a big reason I wanted
47:11
to do that was because I felt like there wasn't very I didn't like like I I liked
47:16
pop music and I was annoyed that the pop music was so much better sounding than
47:22
most Christian music and so like I and I also noticed that I felt like people
47:28
didn't praise God and a lot of people wouldn't like dance and praise God like
47:35
in big ways like with dance and just with energy and I and I felt like it's
47:41
partly because maybe there's not good enough music maybe if we had better music would help them and so I had this like heart to encourage people to praise
47:47
God more and uh you know and and and shine my light in that way and so it was
47:54
a beautiful and good desire but I'm just like thinking like this is what God's called me to do
Gods plan for me
48:00
and but then God had a different plan for me and and no offense to that dream
48:07
I had like if that's someone else's dream and God called you that it's beautiful and amazing but like for me
48:14
God had something like like bigger like God God had something even bigger like
48:20
he could use me greatly in this way but he had something that could really touch even more lives so I wasn't even
48:28
thinking at that time like of people that needed to be free you know I I
48:34
wasn't thinking about how people were stuck in religion and needed their spiritual eyes opened up and needed to
48:41
be equipped to be to be who God called them to be and to be powerful vessels of
48:47
God um I wasn't thinking about how the church as it is today by and large isn't
48:53
how God wants it and he wants to purify his bride so the whole world can transform so so many people can come to
49:01
Jesus I was thinking way more on a smaller level of like I'm just going to
49:07
shine my light and use the gift that God gave me of music and I'm G to bring joy
49:12
to people like I guess I was kind of just just at that that place of like I'm
49:18
called to bring joy to people and help God help people praise God like but God had so much more you know that there was
49:26
just even a greater need than I realized so now God has called me to to
49:33
be a vessel of him to set free thousands of people glory to God from demonic
49:39
oppression and and to equip his body around the whole world and to speak his
49:46
word and open up eyes so they can receive the new wine and they can be
49:51
equipped and they can I can be a vessel that can release anointing so they can receive a part ation so that they can be
49:56
casting out demons and walking on God's power um and the whole the whole God can
50:03
use me to help transform the the um the church like beautify it and purify you
50:10
see how it's so much bigger and though I'm not saying
Thinking bigger
50:15
that my dream was like selfish but it it wasn't selfish I didn't have like selfish motives about it really but I I
50:22
wasn't thinking as big about like there's so many people so many people in
50:28
need need of freedom in need of God's
50:34
word you know I wasn't my mind was so much smaller back then you know my mindset my
50:41
perspective and so then God called me to to be an apostle God called me to do what I'm doing
50:47
now and um serving him here serving him for this greater
50:54
purpose is allowing him to do so much more through my life is allowing him
51:01
to do so many more miracles and touch so many more lives and it required four and a half
51:08
years of like feeling like I wasn't doing anything that huge and like that I wasn't affecting that many lives four
51:15
and a half years of just like day-to-day was really mundane and I just I edited a
51:21
lot of the time and prepared for the sermon and that was my life and our
51:27
church was really tiny so four and a half years I didn't even feel like I was really making that much of a difference
51:33
in the world and touching that many people's lives but it required that to
51:38
touch so many lives and so I say that to why I say that is
51:46
like what God is really calling all of his people is to like to have that to not be my the mindset that I had before
51:54
but now that God has called you opened your eyes and called you into his end time Revival Army to think
52:01
bigger like to think like this is what what God has called me to is what God has called you to as
52:07
well and so don't put too much energy and focus like on your individual dream
52:14
even if it's beautiful and involves like reaching people for God if it means that
52:21
it's taking away what what God has called you to do
52:26
to reach even more people
Serving God
52:33
hallelujah so when God is calling you to serve him in this revival if God has called you to serve
52:40
him here that's the big big thing he's calling you to do that has to be
52:48
priority and you can have confidence that God wants to use my gifts God wants
52:54
to use me here here and doing this here is leading to such a big great work of God in
53:02
through me I get to be a part of Hallelujah so to answer your question
53:09
if God is giving you that desire to serve him like especially serving him in this move of God serving him at fivefold
53:16
church that's definitely from God that's definitely from God there is a need too
53:22
there is a need like God is taking us higher and higher and higher higher and so there's a greater need of Excellence
53:28
that means that there's a need for more people and there's a need for people even currently serving to
53:35
give more to give more Excellence to give more time we go up in every area
53:41
when God calls us higher like this new level that we're in at fivefold church he's stretching us all higher he's he's
53:49
asking even more of us in every area so that we can reach more people for him so
53:55
that we can keep up with God we can't just sit back for the ride be along the
54:01
you know we're sitting back enjoying the ride we're going fast I mean God is taking us fast we have we have to go
54:08
fast with God because we're partner together with God in this we are vessels
54:14
of God so God's doing the Miracles we got to do our part as a vessel if I move from where I am planted
54:22
at FF Church like and physically what whenever that season may be but stay planted from afar am I still
54:29
covered SL protected okay so there will be some people that God calls to be to to to to
54:38
stay in their city or nation and be planted from afar God may have a reason that they
54:43
want them in that City God may be using them to bring Revival in that City we
54:49
also have branches that are coming in the very in the near future to many
54:54
cities and Nations and more branches and God needs an army there in that City a
55:01
nation to be to to to be a part of that branch and to lead help lead the branch
55:06
and serve the branch so there's definitely going to be certain people that are called that God is calling to
55:13
be planted at fivefold church for example from afar and when is God when God has called you to be planted from
55:20
afar then the covering and protection of that anointing that the people living
55:27
in La have is the same as long as you're surrendered to God and following all of
55:33
God's principles and traveling when he's asking you to travel because he definitely wants you to come in person and receive because there's no there's
55:41
no um you can't substitute being there in person and receiving what God wants
55:47
for you in person um impartation you C you cannot
55:53
receive what all that God has for you impartation wise without coming in
55:59
person um I just actually watched a testimony I'm forgetting his name right now um but he's from a different nation
56:07
in Europe and I'm forgetting the nation too but he traveled some of you may remember um I just shared his um
56:13
testimony he posted on YouTube on my Facebook yesterday but
56:19
um he traveled to La months ago a few months ago I forget
56:25
when it was maybe the summer I forget he traveled to La for 2 weeks to be at 5f
56:32
for 2 weeks and he received impartation there and I just watched this testimony right before I did this live right
56:37
before I came live with you such a powerful touching testimony wow God did so many miracles oh my
56:45
goodness thank you Jesus one of the testimonies is one of the I mean a part of the testimony he shared was that when
56:52
he came in person to La the importation he received belied was so powerful when he went back
56:59
God started to use him in power he was pray for people and they would be touched and they would be crying and he
57:05
even God used him to cast demons out of his sister and those things both of those things I just mentioned never
57:10
happened before he received impartation in La at fful church now he had been planted online for a while at that point
57:17
I think more than at least a year I think more so he's receiving online he's
57:22
receiving importation online but it was it wasn't like when he came in person
57:28
that was when the huge difference was that's a principle of God it's it's part of um it's part of this there's a cost
57:34
to the anointing that's part of the sacrifice of the anointing we can't just like comfortably sit on our couch all
57:40
all the time and just receive we have to make effort I traveled to Tanzania East
57:46
Africa several times and received impartation for my spiritual father and though I was communicating with him
57:51
several times um you know Reg regularly From a Distance on the phone but when I
57:58
came in person one time specifically it was like nine months
58:04
after I had started fivefold Church um we had a different name at the time but I hadn't seen God move in power through
58:09
me yet at all like I saw sometimes I would pray for people and I saw like a little bit of tears and stuff but I
58:15
didn't I don't know I to this I didn't know if that was emotions or God but there was no demons cast out sick being
58:22
healed baptism Holy Spirit prophetic anointing moving really that I could see
58:28
now I believe it was but it was at a small degree smaller degree because I
58:34
wasn't seeing any manifestations at all it's not all about manifestations but I wasn't seeing any man like
58:40
manifestations of the power of God for every week I ministered but nine months
58:45
now I know God was moving I know and part of that was like is building faith in me will you trust that you have
58:50
anointing you have a measure of anointing even though you're not seeing it um but also building hunger in me too
58:57
God wanted to build Hunger really hunger to carry his precious anointing and to do to do anything to see God's power
59:06
move as he wanted it to in La at fold church and so I traveled one day a nine
59:13
months uh after ministering every week and I received powerful impartation at
59:20
the church there at my spiritual father Prophet Dr jav's church and I was immediately different I
59:25
on the plane I was so much more spiritual all of a sudden I was on fire I was reading the Bible and this just
59:31
getting Revelation like I never had before and I was so much more spiritual already I felt like less carnal so much
59:38
more spiritual and the whole entire 24-hour flight I'm praying and reading the word the entire time never done that
59:45
before I was just that was so different and that Sunday service I saw God move
59:50
in power for the first time it was Jean tall's mom she it's before Jean tul even came J's mom was there and I touched her
59:58
hand and she just fell back with God's power and then I started praying for
1:00:04
somebody and the prophetic anointing moved through me for the first time I had this knowing in me that I never experienced before I just started
1:00:09
praying things I just started saying words that just came out and they start crying I pray for someone else same
1:00:16
things happens the next week someone's bapti the Holy Spirit now it it was a regular occurrence to see the prophetic
1:00:22
anointing move and sometimes people falling back with God's power being baptized the Holy Spirit no demons cast
1:00:28
out yet or sick healed that came later years later but that was after me going in person
1:00:35
so that's just to say something that if you are planted from afar God is absolutely calling you to come in person
1:00:42
not just once so he will be calling you to come in person like several times come to the
1:00:47
well but then there will be people who God has has moved you to La he is
1:00:54
specifically Ally moved you here and you heard him clearly moving you here and
1:00:59
telling you I am calling you to be here and person and to serve me here in
1:01:05
person I am calling you to be part of this church here in person there are
1:01:10
some people we have several of them here at fivefold church now um several who
1:01:16
who who God has spoken that to and they are here with us and they move from all different uh States cities around the
1:01:23
country so far I we'll have people from around the world someday too but um that
1:01:29
that live that move here but um when God has called you to be here and you leave
1:01:36
after he's called you to be here you're out of God's will so we
1:01:42
can't do things our own way so that so the the grace of the covering and everything that one is receiving from
1:01:49
watching online uh by from being afar when God
1:01:54
has called you to stay where you are from afar and not move that same Grace isn't over you if you step outside of
1:02:03
God's will because of like own desires or wanting to be more comfortable or
1:02:08
something like that so what's important is to make sure that you are in God's will that is where the grace is people
1:02:16
can call themselves Christians but be outside of God's Will and saying I'm a Christian doesn't release the grace of
1:02:24
God over your life being in God's will releases the grace of God over your
1:02:30
life that's where the safety is that's where the protection is that's where the Abundant Life is is in God's will is in
1:02:37
surrender so you have to take it very seriously you you you cannot when you you start to feel like it's more
1:02:43
comfortable over here so I want to go over here and I'll do the Christian thing over here I'll do everything the same over here but this is uncomfortable
1:02:48
here I'm going to do the comfortable thing over here that's out of God's will even though you're living the same way
1:02:54
as a Christian doing everything right but it's out of God's Will and so we have to have the fear of God and take it
1:03:00
so seriously our surrender and obedience to God you said what God is calling you
1:03:06
to do is what he's calling us to does that mean we all are called to teach preach Etc no I mean we are we are all
1:03:12
called to preach saying that the kingdom of God is at hand and cast the demons and heal the sick this is all of our callings but not everyone is called to
1:03:20
be five-fold ministers what I meant was the the work of God that I am called to
1:03:28
we are all called to we are all called it's so important it's going to look
1:03:34
different but to but to serve in God's work to serve to the most important
1:03:42
thing is the Salvation of souls the healing of the sick the casting out of demons to see people be transformed and
1:03:49
be equipped to be powerful vessels of God and we all have a part to play in that we all have a part to play in that
1:03:56
and we have to be United in that we have to do it as a team we have to to assist and serve and help in the work of God
1:04:03
where God has called us to be planted in do our part that a big part of that looks like
1:04:09
sewing you know many times if you don't if you don't know what to do how to serve sewing is a big part of
1:04:15
contributing to this great work but this is the most important thing this is the
1:04:21
most important thing that God is doing right now and so we we have to get out of the mindset of um Church goer on
1:04:30
Sunday just a just a sitting in the Pew or sitting in the
1:04:36
couch listening just on Sunday we have to
1:04:42
we're called to be active we're called to be a part of this we're not called to just let other people do it all in terms
1:04:48
of serving in terms of the work in terms of of of financially too we're called to
1:04:55
be a part of this to play a part actively and
1:05:01
continually this has to be priority to play our part is the saying
1:05:08
if it's God's will it's God's Bill a true saying so it's true if in the terms of
1:05:16
that he will provide the problem is is that many people think that money will
1:05:21
fall from a tree I'll do this if God provides That's
1:05:26
How we'll really know if it's God's will but they're looking for the provision to come their own way and in a lazy
1:05:35
way like sitting back and expecting money to fall from the the sky sitting
1:05:42
back and waiting for someone to knock on the door with money in their hands to give to
1:05:48
them so we have to do our part we have to do our part part to so God can
1:05:55
release the provision sewing is a big part when you sew this is what opens up
1:06:02
the doors of Supernatural Financial blessings to come in your life so that miraculous finances can come so that a
1:06:11
miracle money experience can take place where you're like what I didn't do anything for this but you did you
1:06:18
sowed you soed you know um but but but then but it's not you also have to make
1:06:25
sure you're um you know the Bible says the Bible talks about
1:06:30
how you we have to work how one who doesn't work is going to be poor like we
1:06:37
H we're called to go to work so we can't be lazy in that area we we can't be like I don't feel like working and God's just
1:06:43
going to provide and maybe God's calling you to do something um that's going to require
1:06:49
like more money and God will be asking you to like
1:06:54
maybe look for a higher paying job for for example or
1:06:59
maybe cut down on like budget like cut down on
1:07:06
something frivolous that you're that you're buying that you don't need to for example like God is calling you to take
1:07:13
action so that God can provide perfectly for you for what he's calling you to do
1:07:20
and sometimes there needs to be a sacrifice sometimes God will call you to do something and this means there's going to be a sacrifice it means that
1:07:26
maybe financially it's like a stretch you know maybe you're like in a comfortable place budget wise but to do
1:07:36
this that God's calling you to do you know is a is going to be a stretch and
1:07:43
it's going to be like a risk you know God will call you to do that sometimes as a as a step of faith and
1:07:50
sacrifice sacrifice to him it would would have made more logical sense for me to you know when we had the church we
1:07:58
were in a church building for years before the Revival broke out and there
1:08:04
wasn't enough finances coming in for the the church to be I mean for us to
1:08:11
rent there wasn't there wasn't so that logically it
1:08:17
would make sense for me to like not gather anymore or something
1:08:25
or just like only do online or something um and wait
1:08:30
around for God's timing which that never would have come because I was you know
1:08:35
that wasn't God's will but but no I I had I had to search Lord where is your
1:08:42
provision going to come I ended up asking my parents because I didn't know what else to do but I knew that God wanted us to
1:08:51
have church every week I didn't know what else to do so I asked
1:08:56
and they gave they gave they wouldn't have given more if I didn't ask though if I had been like
1:09:03
prideful cuz I was in my you know I had said God is calling me to this mom and dad and I could have been maybe
1:09:10
embarrassed or something you know maybe thinking they thought I heard from God wrong or something I don't know I could
1:09:16
have been prideful and been like I'm not going to ask them I'm just going to just going to look for money another
1:09:23
way I'm just hope money just shows up and it wouldn't have and then I maybe I would have shut down the the church and
1:09:30
that would have been outside of God's will you know so um it it can be a
1:09:35
sacrifice and a stretching that God is asking you to do sometimes and that's where the provision like the provision
1:09:42
is there it's just not in the way you wanted it sometimes but God still
1:09:47
provided the blessings of God come without sorrow how do we know it's a blessing but there's also a attack of
1:09:54
the enemy
1:09:59
well the blessings of God come with the devil attacking which brings tears
1:10:05
sometimes and pain I'll tell you I'll be the first one to tell you that but that's not what the scripture
1:10:11
is talking about the scripture is not talking about there will never be tears and sorrow and any way accompanied With
1:10:19
the blessings of God that's not what the scripture is saying the scripture is talking about um blessings from the
1:10:25
enemy which aren't really blessings but like
1:10:31
like witches warlocks serving the devil they get benefits from the devil they
1:10:37
get rewards from the devil um like you know like money success Fame
1:10:45
power things that they want um maybe um uh romantic relationship
1:10:54
like love spell type thing the devil can do you know so the devil gives us those
1:11:00
things because he has supernal power but when a person receives those
1:11:06
things it also comes with demons it doesn't come with protection so okay you got the dream you
1:11:14
wanted but that dream's not protected it can just crush and crumble where with God it's protected if it's comes from
1:11:20
God and it's yours to keep um and on top of that like if you're
1:11:28
doing something for the de I mean you're doing something for the devil to get something from the
1:11:34
devil um there's you're going to be demonically oppressed there's going to be demons that come with that and that's
1:11:40
the worst kind of torment and that's the worst kind of suffering um and is to like constantly
1:11:47
have demons so how can you enjoy that thing that you wanted with demons on top
1:11:53
top of that like when you are saved and when you're following God and in his will and you've been free of the lies of
1:12:01
condemnation from the devil like you've been free like your eyes have opened up to know these voices of condemnation are
1:12:06
not God and they're not me they're not truth they're the devil so I'm going to reject them so when your eyes have
1:12:13
opened up to that truth you can have peace all the time you can you have the blessings of God
1:12:18
you're living an abundant life and you can have peace in your mind there's no guilt there's no shame there's no open
1:12:24
door for the devil to bring guilt or shame or condemnation especially because you've been freed of knowing that if the devil
1:12:31
tries with those lies he's lying so there's no power but like if you're serving the
1:12:36
devil like Devil can I mean devil the devil hates everyone including the
1:12:43
people who serve him like he doesn't like love them he doesn't know how to love only God knows how to love devil
1:12:49
doesn't know how to love devil doesn't want to love so he's not it's
1:12:56
like they're going to be having condemnation and shame and guilt always in their mind they didn't get these
1:13:02
things in a pure way you know so it's just hell like you go the devil's way
1:13:09
and Hell comes with it so we could rephrase it as um the blessings of God
1:13:16
don't come with hell the blessings of God come with protection and peace and
1:13:23
and joy and um Purity and come for the glory of God but
1:13:32
the blessings from the devil come with hell that's why serving God is the only
1:13:38
way is the only way to True Life giving your life to Jesus
1:13:44
and seeking after the things of Jesus that's the only way to to find true
1:13:49
life I declare right now over all of you protection in the spiritual realm
