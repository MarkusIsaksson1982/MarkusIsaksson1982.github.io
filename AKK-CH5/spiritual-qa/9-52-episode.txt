do you need to deny the Flesh on everything the flesh wants well living on this Earth there's
0:09
things that the flesh like your body wants like
0:14
food that's that's not a bad thing that's a good thing because if you do
0:19
not eat at all you will not survive but
0:25
um when the when the flesh is influenced
0:31
by the enemy influenced by things like addiction
0:37
obsessions um that is that is the area you need to stop it and deny the flesh so to have
0:46
cravings for food and desire food and eat food that's there's nothing wrong with that that's a good normal thing but
0:54
to be um binging and eating too much
1:00
food that it's unhealthy and um eating too much junk food too much
1:08
too many sweets too many things that are bad for you uh that would be a bad thing
1:13
so um you know living on this Earth You know your your your body will have
1:19
certain desires and it's not all bad it's not like um we live in heaven right
1:26
now we are on this Earth but it's just recogniz izing what is a sin where is
1:33
where is the flesh wanting to sin and um in those areas denying the
1:41
flesh how to know when you go into Ministry if it had been prophesied over
1:46
you I'm concerned I went out of God's timing in the old wine the old wine way everyone just does what they feel and
1:53
they they um they start Ministries without being truly anointed and called
1:59
by God because they feel this way maybe they feel a strong burden they feel a strong
2:04
desire maybe it's a good desire maybe sometimes it's selfish ambition but it's not from God it's just this desire it
2:12
could be that it's not God's timing yet it will come in God's timing that is your calling but um there's one thing
2:19
you you all need to know if you have if you have had a um a past of of going
2:28
into witchcraft if you have had a past of deep demonic torment and then you get
2:34
delivered God is not going to call you to be ministering the next day the next
2:40
month the next year probably not for a few years because you need to grow once
2:48
you get delivered you need to understand that that's like even if you've been a Believer for a while you need to
2:54
understand that once you've gotten delivered you are a baby spiritually and
3:00
that's not just those who are just getting delivered that's most people coming into the new wine and you have to
3:06
be so humble you have to humble yourself to understand this is the new wine we're coming into so you have people who' have
3:13
been Believers for decades but they've been missing so much
3:21
new wine that there is so much they need to unlearn and there's so much they need to learn and that does not happen
3:29
overnight that takes time I was a I was a um unique situation
3:36
where after I received the prophecy I was called to be an apostle well I had my spiritual father directed me he
3:43
directed me when it was time to start Minister ministering I I wasn't just doing it because I feel um this was a
3:51
direction from my covering from my leader and so I when I started five full
3:57
Church it wasn't too long after I received the proph y but this was a unique calling for my life because of
4:04
what I was called to called to be a leader to equip the body of Christ a
4:10
leader to Pioneer this move of God it went quicker in my case but
4:16
actually a big reason why you know I started ministry but it was a very small
4:21
amount of people and even we we decreased in number for years um for
4:27
almost four years we decreased from from 20-some the first year dwindling every
4:33
year down to two people um until until it was God's timing for the
4:40
Revival to break out and then I became a Shepherd a pastor of 300 people in
4:46
person and thousands across the world over overnight all of a sudden pretty
4:53
much overnight God then decided to move but it wasn't overnight that I became
5:00
uh that I was suddenly fully equipped and ready to be a minister this time of
5:06
me ministering to a small amount of people God was um maturing me during
5:11
that time for most people it won't even be time to start ministering it's time to grow and be equipped but I was a
5:18
unique situation God was using this as my refining fire god was God could see
5:23
that because of my because of my heart to to to Really
5:30
um be submitted under my leader it wasn't like dangerous you know like even
5:36
though I didn't go through years of equipping for me to start ministering personally me not too long after
5:43
receiving this direction that I was called to be a minister it wasn't like dangerous because I had a unique
5:49
situation where I was receiving this one-on-one direction from my spiritual
5:55
father and he was um well I had a a humble heart to not just go and do go
6:02
off and do my own thing I'm sharing this with you because I want you to understand like um for me it was years
6:10
before God saw I was ready to really be ministering to a large number of people
6:18
you know it was years until I came into that maturity until I was ready for most
6:23
people like I say I was a unique situation for most people God will not call you to just all
6:30
suddenly be a minister until you have you have taken time to grow you've taken
6:37
time to not focusing on going and Min being a minister but focusing on growing
6:44
this is very important um for your spiritual health it's very important so
6:49
that what what you are releasing is is truly what God wants you to be releasing
6:54
and not mixed with old wine but one of the the big things about why it's very
7:01
important to not start ministering too early before God's timing is
7:09
that when you're under this covering this when you're when you're planted where God's true anointing is you are
7:15
receiving true anointing you are receiving impartation of anointing and so when you have the anointing you are
7:22
casting out demons the demons will flee um this is a a different type of
7:31
ministry world than old wine ministering
7:37
whether's not anointing okay you have to
7:43
be very equipped it's like you're going on the front lines you know it's like you're
7:51
going to have real battle because you're a very serious threat to the devil's
7:56
Kingdom when you carry the anointing very serious
8:01
threat when people start Ministries when they don't have the anointing they are not a threat to the devil it's not as
8:10
dangerous I'm not saying like this is God's will honestly it's God's will for everybody to Humble themselves receive
8:16
the anointing and if they are called to Ministry to then start the ministry in God's timing after time and in God's
8:24
order when their spiritual leader has anointed them commissioned them and sent them all right right so um but but what
8:32
I'm what I want you to understand is like because there's so much to learn in this new wine so you can be there's so
8:39
much mixture that can take place you know you see other people starting Ministries and it's not dangerous and
8:44
the old wine or something you know you think it's harmless to just start a Ministry in the new wine now but it's
8:50
very dangerous when you're not equipped yet when you're not ready yet this
8:55
because you're such a threat to the devil the devil will send serious attacks to try to stop you and and
9:04
temptations and so you you know for me until like I wasn't a threat to the
9:10
devil when there's only a couple people coming to the church and God hadn't yet released the anointing that made demons
9:16
go for years after for years after I started ministering so those like four
9:22
years I wasn't much of a threat to the devil I wasn't impacting many lives
9:30
yet I was I was not casting out demons yet I I was facing battles I was facing
9:36
attack the devil could see a true Prophet prophesied over my life and I I did face attacks like I never faced
9:42
before I've shared a lot of these stories before when we the first year when we only had 15 or so 20 15 people
9:49
um I I faced jealousy and betrayal and lies being made up me about me false
9:55
accusations like I never had in my entire life I don't think I've ever had a false accusation about me ever before in my life so that was the first but um
10:03
the the the jealousy I face that in my life sometimes but not like this and the Betrayal I hadn't really faced that
10:10
really in my life but it the backstabbing that happened the first year so the devil was definitely afraid
10:18
but he was afraid of the future he wasn't necessarily afraid of me right
10:23
then at that time okay and so after years God had equipped me he had taken
10:29
me through refining fire that day after day of showing up in obedience was
10:35
transforming me as I as I share when obedience precedes transformation so
10:41
every single day you show up and serve God you are being transformed each day
10:46
so years passed and you've been completely and radically transformed
10:52
years passed and now you are ready to go to the next level I was then ready to be
11:00
a minister of shepherding many people I was ready I was ready for the
11:08
spiritual attack that would come and I began being a minister having a
11:14
ministering shepherding a lot of people ministering to thousands across the world in
11:20
2021 and in less than a year I faced the the most intense attack persecution
11:28
spiritual battle publicly that I had I could never dream of going through something like that I
11:35
could never dream of evil sent my way I could never dream of malicious attacks
11:42
sent my way the way that that happened I knew I saw other ministers I say I see
11:48
the way big pastors they have videos made up about them and you can just tell they're bogus it's just people being
11:54
jealous and everything like I'd seen that so I'm like I heard the prophecies I knew knew things like that would
12:00
happen you know there would be people people attacking me and all of that but
12:06
I never could have dreamed of this kind of malicious evil that was sent my
12:14
way and you know that time it was like I was kind of in a in in a way I was
12:21
thrown in the pit I was I I I like like Joseph in a way because it wasn't an IM
12:27
immediate vindication you know the malicious attack sent my way people believe a lot of people
12:35
believe the lies the church got a lot smaller that year because people
12:40
believed those lies and um and even the support the giving um decreased so much
12:49
because people believed the lies and that went on for a while and it was a gradual God restoring and Vindication
12:56
coming but the reason I'm explaining all of that is like it's not something so
13:01
simple like persecution comes your way you just got to stay strong through the night weeping in You Know You Weep in
13:09
the night and all of a sudden you're dancing in the morning because God immediately vindicates you the very next morning
13:17
no and so what I'm saying is that takes serious Supernatural spiritual
13:23
strength to to be Christlike through those batt battles
13:30
and to endure and to keep doing the work of God and to not slip up and and speak
13:37
negative words about the people attacking you speak negative words about God speak negative words about your life
13:44
your future you know it takes serious spiritual strength it takes serious spiritual TR strength to be obedient and
13:52
loyal to God to keep showing up and ministering with all of your heart every
13:57
day despite being facing so much Injustice so much that's unfair um so
14:03
much pain it takes a lot of spiritual strength okay and so I'm giving you just
14:10
a glimpse of what Ministry looks like when you are in the
14:20
anointing it's not for the spiritually faint of heart you you need to grow and
14:28
those of you that have just SP delivered you need to understand there's so much growth that needs to happen because when
14:34
you've just been delivered and when I say just I mean even like a year ago that's not that long ago I've said this
14:40
before it's like Egypt you've just come from Egypt and and you you're making a
14:47
journey from Egypt to the promised land okay me personally when when I began um
14:54
Ministry I wasn't dealing with any any tormenting thoughts of the enemy like
15:00
ever like ever God had matured me strength like got me strong spiritually
15:07
first so I was fully having victory over the
15:12
devil so that so that I could then minister to people and be strong not
15:19
have to be dealing with my own stuff you see what I mean like God had
15:26
taken me to a place where I was I knew my identity in Christ he had taken me to
15:32
a place where I had rejected the devil's lies so many times that he had to flee and I was far from
15:39
Egypt and so I I was at this place of strength spiritually myself a mature a
15:47
mature uh disciple child of God so now I
15:52
could step I could be on the front lines you think about leaders in the military
15:57
you think about General they're totally focused not on themselves their own personal lives they
16:04
they have to be like all in for the the people for the work for the
16:12
mission you know like you think about like leaders in general and
16:18
so you don't want to begin Ministry before you're far enough from Egypt that
16:24
you're very strong spiritually now we are all called to
16:30
minister but not be ministers we all like um we're all
16:37
called to minister in terms of being a vessel of God and being a light of the world the moment you give your life to Jesus you should start being a light of
16:43
the world you should start being a vessel of God you should start sharing with people about Jesus you should start sharing your testimony with others you
16:50
you should start sharing on social media what God's doing your testimony that's
16:56
ministering but having a Ministry is when you are going
17:02
live going live and preaching a message and praying for people on the
17:07
live that is equivalent to pretty much equivalent to like having a
17:16
church especially if this is a regular thing it's one time it's it's different if you're like I'm going to go live and
17:22
share my testimony and be be sharing the light of Jesus with people and even you
17:27
can maybe share something you learned but not becoming as I like not be
17:33
portraying yourself as I am a minister because the Bible says you
17:41
shouldn't desire to teach because teachers are judged more
17:47
harshly okay so it's very important that you are not portraying yourself as a
17:53
teacher as a minister because when you are doing that
17:59
you are you are speaking to God's people I am an anointed Minister by God you
18:06
should listen to the words I say because they're coming from God and you can trust these
18:12
words and and people and they're sheep they're sheep looking for a leader and
18:18
you're saying I am a Shepherd I am a leader I am a minister listen to these words I'm saying take them as God's
18:26
word and when you're not anointed by God to do that that's very
18:31
dangerous very you can be misleading sheep it can be with not bad intents that's why you need to have wisdom and
18:39
listen to the the have respect and reverence have respect for the this teaching that comes
18:47
from your leadership you know you can have not bad
18:53
intents at all um but be misleading people you know that's why I say it's so
18:59
just as much as it's important to have your personal relationship with Jesus spend time in the word of God it's also
19:05
just as important to heed the teachings from your spiritual leader because
19:11
according to Ephesians 4 that is the way of equipping God's people is the ministry
19:19
the fful ministry your spiritual leader God speaks through to release wisdom to
19:24
take you from being a baby to maturity if you if you read the Bible without any spiritual leader number one
19:31
you probably won't um have proper Revelation you won't have revelation of
19:37
the new wine but number two you will stay baby you a baby
19:43
spiritually it's the maturity the wisdom comes from God moving through his way of
19:49
equipping through the fold Ministry through your spiritual leader back to what I was saying of um ministering out
19:55
of God's timing um the biggest thing to realize is the danger of it when you're
20:02
in the anointing that's that's the main thing that you should realize like the importance of you being ready you being
20:11
very strong
20:16
spiritually you know like when when I face those intense
20:23
attacks praise God through his great equipping and and perfect time me I was
20:30
strong so like when those attacks were happening devil tried to lie a little
20:37
the devil tried to lie a little bit but I I've shared this before like the farther you way go from Egypt the more
20:44
you don't hear the sounds of Egypt the more you're rejecting the devil's lies as time goes by months
20:50
years go by the devil's voice is quieted and he's like literally not allowed to
20:57
to to speak to you and and you become so strong that if he ever tries you you
21:03
recognize his lies so clearly that has it has no power over
21:10
you and and so it's a combination of the devil realizing he's wasting his time so he doesn't even attempt on a regular
21:18
basis there can sure be once in a great while this random attack of condemnation or a random attack of weakness you had
21:25
in the past that he tries oh maybe I can get him or her again from this cuz this was a weakness years ago like that can
21:32
happen once in a great while or just trying to inflict pain through somebody's words and use those words
21:40
sometimes you know but like for me personally I'm not I'm not hearing the devil's voices
21:47
like pretty much ever because as time goes by i' I've
21:56
just filled myself with the truth that it's like my mind is full of Truth and I
22:01
know fully what truth is and it's just there's no way the
22:07
enemy can come in and bring lies and once in a while if a lie comes
22:15
I'm like like it doesn't have a chance to enter it doesn't have a chance for me
22:20
to wonder is that true you know all right and so when when I face
22:29
those attacks a big reason I was able to be strong and overcome them was
22:35
that I wasn't getting all insecure like people were saying really mean things about me really horrible things about me
22:42
you know a lot of people would say to me like she looks creepy like she's so expressive there's something I look in
22:48
her eyes and she looks so creepy and I I I mean that's just one of the many different there was all sorts of evil
22:55
things that people would would speak about me oh all sorts of evil things and
23:02
I wouldn't give time to look at them but sometimes you can't help but but see you know especially in the heat of those
23:10
attacks but like if I wasn't strong spiritually I could start like getting insecure I could start like obsessing
23:19
over oh like should I not be as expressive like it do my my eyes get
23:26
buggy looking or something you know like I could start I didn't think of that at all like I didn't I I didn't battle with
23:33
those kinds of thoughts at all you know I so much evil was coming towards my way
23:39
but I didn't like get distracted and get swept away and I never and I never had
23:45
those types of attacks before so if you're I never had people tell me like I look creepy or think you know things
23:52
like this um and so if you're not strong spiritually you get an attack you never
23:58
never faced before it could really be like a downward spiral and spiral
24:04
and pull you away from being focused on God you know but I but God had equipped
24:10
me and gotten me so strong glory to God that all of these lies all of these mean
24:17
things were coming at me and I I didn't have to be distracted and swept away
24:24
with insecurity I didn't have to be swept away and distracted by
24:29
um doubting myself doubting the prophecies over my
24:35
life doubting my spiritual father or something you know I I I I couldn't be
24:40
swept away by that because God had strengthened me so
24:47
much so that's how I was able to continue with the work of God that's how I was able to to not give in to any kind
24:54
of lie of the enemy or Temptation and and fall away from God's
25:00
will imagine if I gave into any of those lies that were coming and I said you know at that time
25:07
there was a lot of manipulation trying to happening towards me people trying to manipulate me there's a lot of ministers that were like trying to get me to like
25:15
come under them like there's these like ministers like wanted I think they wanted like me to associate with them um
25:24
there was it's like there there was this pressure that I should leave my spiritual father and like they can help
25:30
me and they can counsel me and I can come under them and but I could just see through the manipulation I could see
25:36
there was this wanting wanting people them to like come over me type thing um
25:41
and control me and like use me like use use use me you know for their
25:48
gain so I could have given into that you know that you could see this like
25:53
manipulating scheme of like if you just do this then the attacks will go away and everybody will like
26:01
you and then you'll be popular you'll be with the the popular
26:07
crowd you know the the the people who have connections and all of that you'll be there you'll get invited to all of
26:13
the conferences and and everything you know that that
26:19
manipulation was trying to was was trying to come to
26:24
me you know and so if I had you know given an ear to any of those lies I
26:31
could have got and that if I gave into that manipulation I would have been stepping
26:37
out of God's will I'm telling you the anointing would have left me and I don't even know what would have happened to me
26:43
I don't even know because when you go out of God's will that's a dangerous place I I don't
26:49
even know what could have happened like when you step out of God's will you're giving the devil such a big
26:56
foothold such it's not as simple as oh well you
27:02
you're you'd still be used by God but not as powerfully I don't know what could have happened I don't know what
27:08
could have entered my heart I don't know how I could have been deceived and you
27:15
know dangerous if you're not if you don't have that strength if
27:22
you're not equipped and strong to deal with these types of deductive tactics of the enemy that
27:32
comes through severe persecution when you're
27:40
anointed and God had God had entrusted me with I mean God was counting on me to be
27:47
Christlike through that he had he had equipped me to he had
27:55
transformed me through those years that when people were doing such evil things to me that I I didn't deserve but they
28:01
were they were making up flat out lies and doing evil things to me and doing it publicly several and several were
28:08
combining together partnering together to do this but I held my tongue glory to God
28:15
for him giving me strength glory to God for thank you to my spiritual father for for being there
28:23
for me you know for being there all the way through that to comfort me to equip me to to encourage me to for his example
28:31
of how he loves his enemies how he's been through all this persecution but he just kept believing kept believing God
28:38
and kept being Christlike and kept loving his enemies I had his example and
28:43
so you know and I haven't really seen that example besides my spiritual father so
28:49
it I could have been going ear uh tat for
28:54
Tat eye for eye you know
29:02
and that would have been so sad to like lead people astray I'm thousands of
29:08
people are watching me and all of a sudden I'm I'm I'm showing hate to my
29:15
enemies and I'm speaking against them and I'm not letting God fight my battles for
29:21
me and God had and God entrusted me to God entrusted thousands of people
29:28
to look at me as a Christlike example and I start doing that if I had started doing
29:34
that that's serious that's leading people astray
29:39
that's teaching people the opposite of the way of
29:45
Christ just by just by going tat for Tat which doesn't seem that big of a deal
29:51
it's leading people astray I mean it's teaching people hate
29:57
instead of love that's serious and so I I share this
30:02
because I um it's it's so serious I just want you
30:08
to all know it's like so serious to wait on the lord it's in this new wine don't
30:13
rush God don't rush God don't rush God wait on
30:19
him a friend asked me to pray for her and I felt to ask her to renounce but is that my place to do first of all I want
30:26
to direct you if if those of you that asking questions and I direct you to a message please make sure you're writing this down because some of these require
30:33
more in-depth um answers than I can give right now so make sure you're writing
30:38
down these sermons because a lot of these questions I've shared a whole message on so um this question um there
30:47
is a message it's on the um the secret
30:52
of the anointing playlist on my YouTube and I believe there's a two parts
30:58
message in that playlist that says how to cast out demons and heal the
31:04
sick I believe it's called something like that I really share with you in depth like um the order how to know when
31:14
it's God's timing um how to know when it's your in your Dominion in your territory so
31:20
listen to that message but to give you um an to give you a short answer right now you should minister to people people
31:28
minister in terms of praying for them when it is in your spiritual
31:33
Dominion what is not your spiritual Dominion is um the church where you are
31:39
planted so that's when the church is being held and outside so because the
31:44
the the way it is supposed to work in the new wine we see that in the times of Peter that all came under his shadow all
31:52
who were sick and Demon oppressed and all were healed and all were free why because this is God's real order true
31:59
order of how to heal and deliver people that people would come and plant theirself plant themselves where God was
32:06
calling them to be planted and the church he's calling them to be planted and he puts anointing in Apostle Peter Apostle Peter of today an apostle a
32:14
minister a leader of today of the church he puts anointing there and it's a high level anointing to deal with even high
32:21
demonic cases high level demons and so the anointing is released to all of
32:29
the people for all their needs there is not a lack of the anointing coming
32:34
through Apostle Peter through Apostle Peter of today that's why the Bible says all were healed the Bible does not say
32:41
um those who Peter prayed for one-on-one were healed but there were a lot of people
32:47
who weren't healed so then Peter then told um others in the church to cast
32:53
demons out individually of these people that didn't receive when they came under Peter's Shadow when and they came to to
32:59
to the church where Peter was ministering now this is not what we see in the church by and large today but
33:04
that's because we don't see the anointing by and large in the church today but we're getting back to God's ways so this is the biblical way that
33:13
there was all the anointing needed in Apostle Peter and it's he he walks in
33:19
his authority and he says this anointing in me it must be released to every person here every single person here and
33:25
it was high level anointing so it's could deal with even high level demons they had to go principalities they had
33:32
to go only fful ministers specifically Apostles and Prophets carry the
33:38
highlevel anointing highest level anointing to deal with the highest level
33:43
demonic cases so when it comes to uh you know seeing the body of Christ seeing
33:49
Believers needing healing or Deliverance the first thing that should come to mind is bring them to the church where power
33:55
God's power is bring them to my church where God power is moving we must bring them there that's what they did with in
34:01
the times of Peter it says they brought the sick and Dem oppressed under Peter Shadow and all were
34:08
healed so um and and and why that should be in the mind in the heart is because you don't
34:16
know the level of demons this person might have number one they might have a high level demonic case that the
34:22
anointing you have it might not be a high enough level to deal with these demons
34:28
and number two this person needs to be equipped
34:33
they need to be saved they need to give their life to Jesus and they need to be delivered and they need to be equipped to maintain their deliverance and they
34:39
need to be equipped to be a mature believer not just pray for them and
34:44
that's it cast The Demon out of them and that's it so that's why it's very important like the most important thing
34:50
is to lead them to a church where God's power is moving and it should be where you're
34:55
planted that should be the main Direction but sometimes God will lead
35:02
you to cast a demon out of somebody um who's in your who who who is in your Dominion in your Dominion means like
35:09
this can be in your workplace this can be friends that aren't planted at the church you're planted at Um this can be uh uh People You
35:18
Meet going around in life doing errands and things you're having a conversation with somebody they start noticing the
35:24
light of Jesus in you you start sharing your testimony they start sharing I need that I need what you have received I
35:29
have so much anxiety I have Suicidal Thoughts I have depression I have addiction and the Holy Spirit it depends
35:35
on situation but it depends on it depends on the case but holy spirit may
35:41
lead you in that time hey I can I can pray for you I believe God would want to deliver you right now and in that time
35:47
usually you should lead them to renounce do you want to renounce this addiction that you have this is an important key
35:52
to being set free it's you making your decision I don't want this anymore I want want freedom you can share that
35:59
briefly with them why that's important to renounce and then pray for them command that demon to go and maybe they
36:06
have many demons and maybe you casted one demon out of them praise God but get them to church so that they can continue
36:11
to receiving more receive more Deliverance maybe Holy Spirit leads you to pray for them and they they're free
36:17
from one demon maybe they have a higher level demon that's a higher that that the anointing you carry doesn't have the
36:22
authority over that higher level demon so that's why you got to invite them to church amen
36:30
hallelujah but yes it's very important to that all believers are casting out demons like when it's God's timing as
36:36
holy spirit's leading there will be a time and maybe it maybe if none of you
36:42
have cast out demon for it that's okay it's it's literally holy spirit's timing the most important thing is that people
36:48
are free not that you are casting out demons the most important thing is that God's people are free it's God's kingdom
36:56
that makes demon to go not an individual person so we want to look to God's kingdom God's kingdom government let's
37:03
get them to where the high level anointing is to get them free amen there will there will probably come a time
37:09
though in most of your lives maybe it's already happened maybe it'll be tomorrow maybe it'll be a week a month a year
37:14
three years from now where God will lead you to cast out a demon but you should not be looking at insecurity upon
37:20
yourself because it's not if you're not a fightful minister you're not going to
37:25
be casting out demons like all the time it's it it will happen from time to time
37:30
as Holy Spirit leads but your job is to your big job is
37:36
to birth sheep sheep birth sheep your big job is to bring people into the
37:41
kingdom where they can receive everything that God has for them bring them to the church where they can be
37:46
receiving the anointing over their lives you use your anointing the light in you to attract people to come to Jesus to
37:53
come into the kingdom that's the main job of a believer and then sometimes God lead God uses you
38:00
to cast out demons sometimes God uses you to heal the sick
38:06
amen how do you not let people walk all over you manipulate you without coming off as unloving or
38:13
rude so um people who are
38:19
manipulative are prideful are being used by the
38:25
enemy are selfish are self- serving they're manipulating
38:30
because they want you to do something for them okay so never feel bad for
38:38
refusing to be manipulated because to come under that
38:43
manipulation is to be disobedient to God and is to give into what the enemy wants you to
38:51
do if a person is trying to manipulate you they are after a a bad and evil
39:00
agenda and so when you come under that manipulation you're helping them achieve that evil
39:07
agenda so you should not ever feel bad about um refusing to be
39:16
manipulated now it's usually not our place to call people out and say this is evil
39:24
what you're doing I will not be manipulated by you it's usually just not our place usually
39:30
it's that's a situation where God wants us to love our enemies because it's the kindness of God that leads to repentance
39:35
so the best thing you can do is just lovingly kindly say no put up
39:43
boundaries and go on with life don't worry about how they feel you know
39:49
people who manipulate it's like they're acting you know they're acting they're lying
39:55
they're it's not like genuine they're doing you know it's like it's like uh
40:01
like they're faking they're acting you know like so if
40:07
you say no they'll probably continue they they're like not wanting to give up
40:12
so they'll maybe they'll act all upset but like you shouldn't see that as
40:19
like oh no I hurt them I made them sad no they're like putting on something
40:28
they it's they're they're still trying to manipulate it's like you you you would you said no and so they're they
40:35
really want their way so they're not they're not just going to be like okay because then they wouldn't manipulate in
40:41
the first place right so you shouldn't feel bad if people are like
40:48
upset that's just if you are feeling bad that's like their manipulation like
40:53
working you know what I mean like they want you to feel bad and if you will not give into the
40:59
manipulation they at least want you to feel bad because they're angry and this
41:05
is the devil this is the devil influencing their thoughts the devil's angry that you're not giving into to
41:10
this and I've seen this happen with the devil like the devil like he I've seen
41:16
like when um when God like has moved in Greater ways like than ever before like bringing
41:24
more people to receive than ever before and moving so mightily in anointing I'll see how like the devil can't stop it but
41:30
like sometime I've experienced this before like after an event he'll he'll try to do something to like inflict pain
41:35
upon me like that's all he can do like and you don't have to give into that though but he'll try to just like he's
41:41
just like mad he's like he can't do anything um to stop you when you're
41:47
truly not giving into the devil's lies and surrender to God and obedient to God so all he'll try to do is like make yous
41:54
make you make you hurt in some way cuz he's just angry you know that's how it
42:00
is with um people who manipulate so don't give into that don't don't feel
42:05
bad you know feel feel happy that you were obedient to God what Jesus has done in your life
42:13
it's it's the work of Jesus so you need to stand strong and be proud of Jesus and be unashamed and there's
42:20
people who are being ashamed of Jesus there are people who are speaking against the work of Jesus
42:27
um you you need to realize how wrong that is you know
42:34
and stand strong with Jesus and be unashamed of him many people right now are ashamed of
42:41
Jesus many Believers are ashamed of Jesus
42:47
many I mean many are ashamed of the works of the Holy Spirit many are ashamed by Deliverance many are ashamed
42:54
by um the anointing by impartation many are ashamed by God's servants his true
43:01
servants what I mean is they call it the enemy the devil they
43:06
they call it not real they they're they're jealous of it
43:12
sometimes you know um isn't that wild to think about that
43:18
people who are jealous of Servants of God they're actually being jealous of
43:26
Jesus you know like if you despise the work of God because of jealousy because you're
43:32
jealous of a servant of God where the anointing is being released then that means you're ashamed of the work of
43:38
Jesus it means you're ashamed of it means you're jealous of Jesus then that's that's really wrong so anyways
43:46
you got a lot about you got a lot of that in the body of Christ day you got a lot of people who are not standing with
43:52
Jesus I see people that I mean if you only preach if you just preach just
43:59
preach and you preach messages that aren't about
44:06
Deliverance or the power of God the anointing five-fold
44:12
Ministry you just preach the safe messages that people are
44:18
used to hearing you will you people will love
44:23
you most Believers will love you most Believers will applaud you most Believers
44:28
will um just stand with you you
44:34
know but when you not just
44:39
preach but you demonstrate the power of God cast out demons release the anointing allow the
44:46
Holy Spirit to move how he wants and you preach about things that make people
44:54
uncomfortable you preach the new wine you preach pre about the anointing Deliverance order in the church
45:01
prophetic Ministry you'll have a you'll have a lot of
45:07
people hating a lot of people saying it's not God a lot of people skeptical a
45:14
lot of people saying I got got a weird feeling about this you
45:19
get a lot of that yeah so those of you that are in the truth
45:25
those of you you those of you that are in the new wine you need to have a wakeup call about this you need to know the reality of what happens in the body
45:33
of Christ what's going what goes on in the body of Christ um you know just that there are so many who um are not
45:42
accepting of the Holy Spirit you know and so you have to to be the one that
45:48
will be different and stand strong with Jesus unashamedly and just have your eyes open
45:53
up to see there are those who don't believe but there are those who do and I'm going
45:59
to stand with those who do and I'm not going to um worry about what my neighbor thinks I'm not going to give an ear over
46:06
there I'm not going to be distracted I'm going to stand with Jesus I'm going to stand with the Revival Army
46:13
and I'm going to have my eyes laser focused on Jesus and this most important work in the world that he has called me
46:21
to amen the work the question by the way I was answering was having to do with
46:27
other people's opinions other people disapproving of your testimony that you've shared but remember this is the
46:34
year of acceptance so this is the year that things are going to shift I mean there will always be haters there will
46:40
always I mean always there will always be those who reject Jesus who reject the
46:46
move of God but this is the year of acceptance this is the year we're going to see a big shift where eyes will be
46:54
opened up eyes and we're seeing this I've been hearing testimonies of this
46:59
Lately from people I remember hearing testimonies from some of you sharing like my
47:07
family's against um the move of God and everything and now they're like sharing
47:14
on social media their daughter's testimony when their parents were against
47:20
it this I just saw this this week and I I've seen a lot of these things the a lot of testimonies like this from some
47:26
of you I've been seeing a lot lately Hallelujah this is the year of acceptance I once was blind but now I
47:33
see all of us have been in the dark in some way and then there was a moment God opened our eyes and everything changed and so those
47:41
moments are going to be happening for a lot of people like never before this year where they have been blind but now
47:47
they will see Saul's turning into Pauls this is the Year this is the year for
47:54
Pharisees like Saul to turn into Pauls to to turn into people who will stand
48:00
with Jesus and be powerful vessels of God in this revival Army
48:05
hallelujah hallelujah what should our social media accounts look like what to share and how
48:12
often should we should we share the videos you post
48:17
and in the same time you do there's not a formula there's not a there's not a certain way but
48:24
just it'll look different for everybody but what's important is that you are
48:29
doing your best to share to share what God is doing I would say to share all
48:35
the live streams whenever um I'm going live share share so people can see it
48:40
right there live and then share several testimonies and miracles and preaching
48:49
Clips doesn't have to be every single one but just do do your best to share
48:55
the good news it there's no formula it'll look different for everybody but just do your
49:00
part do your best to spread this good news sometimes I see like some emails
49:07
come and even questions here that I just want to like answer this right now so you all have this equipping and this is
49:13
in regards to jobs um so when it comes to Ministry to
49:19
starting your own Ministry this should be a prophetic Direction a prophetic word from your spiritual leader but when
49:27
it comes to what jobs to get should you start this job should you start this business um this will be mostly for the
49:36
most part not you know coming as a prophetic word from your spiritual
49:41
leader um because when it comes to I mean there there's sometimes that maybe
49:47
it will be God's appointed time where a prophetic word will come you should go in this direction for this business for
49:54
this career that can come sometimes but for the most part you know I've shared this
50:00
before for the most part um when it comes to
50:06
jobs the Holy Spirit wants you You're Made In His Image You're Made In God's image and so the Holy Spirit wants you
50:12
to walk in wisdom and when it comes to jobs when it comes to starting businesses to really
50:18
walk in wisdom um you know rather than like needing a
50:25
prophetic word about it like I said there can be times where God divinely
50:31
comes with a specific Direction go here start this business do this job but if
50:39
that is not coming if that if currently you don't have this prophetic word that
50:44
means that God is calling you to use wisdom use
50:50
wisdom um use wisdom to to find the job find a
50:57
job because God wants everybody to work um the Bible talks about how if we don't work we won't we won't eat like we this
51:04
is how we access provision from God now of course there's certain Seasons where maybe you won't for whatever reason
51:12
um uh you know maybe you're at college you know
51:18
and you so your your your parents are being gracious and you you don't have a part-time job or something like like
51:23
that's fine you're focusing on your studies you know things like this there'll be times where you won't work or
51:29
um but but but for the most part God's calling um all of his people to work
51:35
because he wants you to not he wants you to be able to bless others he wants you to be be able to contribute to the work of God he doesn't want you to be in a
51:42
place of lack he wants you to have provision he wants you to have abundance and so how he releases this abundance
51:49
for the most part is through your job so um I've I I think I have a playlist
51:55
called practical wisdom and i' and I've shared there's another message that I
52:03
preached like maybe a couple months ago where it was specifically on wisdom
52:11
like how like the importance of wisdom like so often people are like looking for
52:17
signs looking for a prophetic word looking for a dream God should I do this
52:22
and God isn't GNA come and this like yes but rather it's like this big kind of
52:29
sign or big dream prophetic word but it's more that he wants you to walk in
52:36
wisdom and make the decision and sometimes there isn't when it comes to jobs sometimes there
52:41
honestly isn't like a for the most part actually with jobs until maybe later on
52:47
in life it's a certain job that God really wants you to have but for a lot of people like especially if you're
52:53
younger you go through different jobs you know you're on a journey um but but
52:59
for the most part it's not like God's like I want you to have this job and then I want you to have this job but
53:04
it's that a lot of different jobs are okay to have like God can use you in this job to touch people there there's
53:10
people that are lost and need him in at in this workplace and this work in all
53:16
the workplaces so God can use you in in different places
53:22
um that's a big thing that's going to happen like when in terms of like why God would want you in certain places
53:29
is but is to use you as a vessel amen and to provide for you what you need to be provided for so sometimes you may be
53:37
um putting your standard too low and not looking for a job that is like a higher pay for example that maybe you didn't
53:44
think you could get but because God's favor is with you and you have faith you do apply anyways and then God surprises
53:49
you and you get it and so he wants to to to give you more there so maybe this like other job that doesn't pay very
53:56
much maybe God doesn't want you there so I'm not so so what I'm trying to say is like there's a realm of like jobs that
54:02
can work that you know so what what I'm saying is God wants you to use wisdom
54:09
use wisdom what are the gifts that you have what are your passions um and what is the uh uh what
54:16
is the what is the um the the money you need to make to to
54:24
to cover your bills and stuff you know you take those things right and
54:30
sometimes maybe you you know you need you need provision and
54:37
your your giftings are only like or your giftings and passions are only like singing well you know that doesn't mean
54:44
I have to look for a singing job you know for me I was a I was a waitress I
54:50
was a hostess I was a nanny but when I looked for those jobs I was like I like
54:55
interacting with people and even the nanny and I liked children so but I wasn't like this is what I want to do
55:01
with my life is interacting with people in a restaurant or this is what I want to do with my life this is a big passion
55:06
of mine um Nanny and children like those weren't big passions but it was
55:12
something I knew that I would have more passion interacting with people than like a like a a desk job for for for
55:20
like for me personally type thing right so um that's just an example so so see
55:27
where you would would have some sort of passion some sort of passion or maybe
55:32
some sort of gifting and then does it is it going to provide is it going to be
55:39
enough money maybe you'll need to have two part-time jobs or something something like that you know um so
55:45
that's what I mean by wisdom that's for for anybody who's thinking like thinking about a job or thinking to pursue
55:50
something and to get a degree in something that's it you know you don't need to um worry so much did I get a
55:57
sign is this right you need to work you need to find a job that's the
56:02
important thing and so as long as it's not something demonic as long as it's not going working at a strip club you
56:10
know working as a scammer you know working um at a casino
56:16
like like um doing working with gambling and things you know what I me as long as it's not those things but it's it's not
56:23
something that's immoral then that's that's fine and I and I see
56:30
a lot of emails sometimes so I really want to address that to not think I need I need this word from God do I apply for
56:37
this job is you know um for the most part it's it's just walking in holy in
56:43
in wisdom you know um and then in terms of business the direction I will give
56:48
with this is like some people they want to some people they have a really exciting dream of a business and they
56:53
are really not content at the job they're at but um most of us especially like when
57:02
we start out like ear in my 20s and um early 30s when I was working I was a
57:08
Hostess waitress nanny I was not excited to go to work each day you know I was I wasn't miserable but I was not excited I
57:15
I mean but you have to work you know but there's a lot of people who are not um
57:22
happy at their jobs and they have a greats business idea and many people they want to just like stop working and
57:30
just focus on the business but for the most part you can't do that or else
57:36
there will be no money coming in because starting a business I mean for income to be coming in for most businesses it
57:41
takes time it takes many times takes investment so many times it's very important you're working a steady job
57:48
you're saving money to invest in a business for example um and the business
57:53
comes like little by little by little by little and and and God when it comes to
57:59
like lifting you and abundance coming and provision go he goes step by step
58:05
you know and so um it's so important to not think like that you'll be an
58:10
overnight overnight tons of success with a business that you start you know uh so
58:16
that's the wisdom I'll give there if you have a business idea that's amazing like if you can start it that's great just
58:23
make sure you are um doing it with wisdom you know like that you're not
58:29
like quitting a job and then you have no money coming in and you're just like banking on you you know you're your
58:36
sometimes we can like oh God's going to provide but we're not using wisdom we're you
58:42
we're using it's like an immature kind of faith if that if that makes sense you know like we have to understand God
58:48
moves in steps um we have to make sure we're not just like going after our own
58:54
desires and putting it on God you know like I want to do this I don't want to do this so I'm just going to
59:00
believe God's going to provide like that's that's being like little manipulative you know of God so you know
59:07
that's why I say um the wisdom is the the important part amen but I bless all
59:13
of you who are you know going at with business ventures starting businesses
59:18
those of you that are um looking for new jobs you know applying for schools to be
59:24
trained up in something I bless that I bless that as you as this is walking in wisdom with God I bless it and I want I
59:31
I don't want people to I don't want any of you to feel like um is this right is this wrong as I say most of the time um
59:39
it's it's you know it's not like there's a right or wrong uh uh path with with
59:45
with jobs a lot of the time um it's important that you're walking in
59:50
wisdom amen and God will bless it God will bless the work of your hands and if there does need to be uh if God does
59:57
specifically want you're at a specific place he will make it clear so in the meantime it's walking in wisdom and
1:00:03
making uh Godly decisions decisions as you are made in the image of God is
1:00:10
taking a risk wisdom we were recently advis Us in regards to our business well anything that you do in faith is a risk
1:00:17
right so um so risks are a good thing when it's Holy
1:00:25
Spirit l when it's when it's with wisdom like you know but it's not just done in
1:00:31
a worldly way without wisdom but a lot of things require risks if you see if
1:00:38
you think about a lot of businesses if you see a lot of um companies who have been successful they all had to take
1:00:44
risks they all had to and they all had Faith they all had Faith like I can do
1:00:49
this I can I have this dream and and God wants us to be that way but inviting him
1:00:54
in and inviting him in to bless us and to bless the work of our hands you know just start out with that
1:01:00
intention just start out with that intention and then you know it's you've received wisdom and now you're accepting wisdom
1:01:08
and so that wisdom guides you I don't have scriptures right now but there's a lot of scriptures in proverb about
1:01:13
wisdom but I'm just thinking right now there's a lot of scriptures in Proverbs especially about wisdom like wisdom I
1:01:20
think there's a scripture about like wisdom guides you you know so when you accept wisdom and you really you take
1:01:27
the word as truth and you're like this is truth I believe this I want to follow
1:01:32
this I want to apply this when you do that that becomes a part of you and that
1:01:37
guides you it's God guiding you God is wisdom wisdom wisdom is the holy spirit
1:01:42
but it's like the words of God coming through like here like through me for example the words of God coming you're
1:01:48
like yes this is truth that word of God you put in you so now that word of God
1:01:53
truth is in you and that's guiding you hallelujah what does backsliding mean in
1:02:00
the new wine just backsliding just means um opening the door to the enemy and um
1:02:05
not immediately repenting and just um veering away from
1:02:11
stay in the truth and surrender that's what it means I had to share I had to examine
1:02:19
three women sexually abused this week I tried to share the love of Jesus but I am broken my heart just broke I cannot
1:02:24
sleep I I want to declare right now peace to you and this this burden would
1:02:30
be taken off of you in Jesus name because this is Jesus's burden so Jesus
1:02:37
wants you to be a vessel of him and let him do the rest he wants you to to give
1:02:45
that burden to him and then and then maintain your peace and
1:02:51
your joy you know because we are limited to what we can do God does the rest we
1:02:58
do our part and we trust God does the rest and so um you know for things
1:03:03
outside of your control God doesn't want you to take that on you know like like
1:03:09
worry worrying that's in God's hands and like
1:03:15
you know worrying can't change it what's important is that we protect
1:03:21
our heart and keep our fire burning keep our light shining you know it's important we are F
1:03:27
we are showing the joy of the Lord and peace and the love of God every day and
1:03:33
sometimes it'll be hard to see things it'll be hard to see what people are going through
1:03:39
but we we allow God to take that burden and we keep our light burning so I
1:03:45
declare that you would sleep peacefully from now and no more worries heaviness
