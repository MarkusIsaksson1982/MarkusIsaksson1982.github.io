0:01
how necessary is it to be surrounded with and talk with people burning for
0:06
Jesus what the Bible says iron sharpens iron and the meaning of that is when you
0:12
are close with talking with an iron like um someone on fire for
0:21
God someone in love with Jesus that's going to sharpen you so we need each
0:28
other Fellowship is important in the body of Christ we are a body and when we
0:34
come together we do strengthen each other uh it God totally wants you to
0:42
have people who are iron sharpening iron for you totally wants people who are
0:48
equally yolked on fire for Jesus surrendered to God to be in close friendship with you um but the thing is
0:56
is that the timeline of when these relationships come in one's life is
1:02
different for everybody and so there can be a time where God is pruning out the like the
1:10
bad branches in your life that can be bad relationships that can be people that aren't on fire for Jesus aren't
1:17
surrendered to God and usually the the the the new friends new
1:24
people who are on fire surrender to Jesus don't come at the same time don't come before
1:30
or the old relationships go away and they usually
1:36
don't come right after immediately after uh God uses so many
1:42
different circumstances to develop our faith to strengthen our faith um to to
1:49
do a lot of different things in our heart to draw us closer to him um to I
1:55
mean for God to be your number one that you would love him Above All Else
2:00
that you would really put him first he uses different circumstances different
2:05
things to test this to test this in your heart so um this is one of the examples
2:13
like having you in a season where you don't have anyone close to you who's
2:18
like physically who's on fire for Jesus who surrendered to God it doesn't mean it's like a bad thing it doesn't mean
2:25
like you know you're not going to be sharpened it doesn't mean you know you're going to stay stagnant cuz you
2:30
don't have anyone right now it doesn't mean you need to go searching seeking to find your iron sharpen iron
2:38
friend SL friends it doesn't mean that necessarily um so for many people there
2:46
will be there can be like this season where those people haven't come yet but
2:51
you want them you desire them and you've closed the door on in the friendships
2:57
that God wanted you to and the people that were actually holding you back who aren't surrendered to God who aren't equally
3:03
yed so God can use this season of it being just you and him and that's okay
3:09
so um be patient God's timeline is different than ours his ways are higher than ours so sometimes we can feel like
3:16
a season is taking too long when it's just God's timing and it's part of the
3:21
stretching and pruning and refining so it's it's it's very much like marriage like uh when it comes to the SP your
3:29
spouse you know a lot of people have this wrong thought of like you need to put yourself
3:36
out there and go on a bunch of dating websites and like go find um social
3:47
networking like or social activities where you can like find a spouse like
3:53
find different Christian events or something in your city like you got to make it happen like that that's wrong
4:00
that's wrong um you need to solely just focus on what God has called you to do
4:07
on what how he's called you to serve him and it's going to involve uh
4:14
usually going to a church going to a church in person and and being around um
4:23
people who are surrender to God for number one so um I mean but it could be a season maybe where you live you you
4:30
you can't go in person and so you're like how am I going to meet anybody well you know when when you want your spouse
4:37
can be different than when God wants you to meet your spouse you can be thinking oh my gosh I'm just I'm just like kind
4:45
of isolated like I don't want to be but like you know I I I I live far away from
4:51
the church that I'm planted in for example um how am I going to meet somebody and God's like don't worry like
4:59
this isn't the season right now don't worry about you trying to make it happen you know I got I have a great plan and I
5:08
can make these miracles happen in one second you to meet the person you're supposed to meet in one second and it's
5:13
only one person you need to meet you don't you know only one person you need to meet so stop thinking about
5:20
probability and the chances and all these things and just give it to me God
5:27
saying um so so yeah when it comes to like the people
5:33
that God has called you to bring close in your life to be really close friends and family it's similar to to marriage
5:41
you don't need to force it you don't need to try to make it happen just do
5:48
what God's calling you to do just serve him doing the things he's asking you to do and then he will take care of the
5:55
rest he will move his miraculous hand he will make things happen and if it if
6:01
it's if it come if it's like you in in the area of you needing to meet someone whether it's
6:08
your the friends he wants you to bring close in your life or a spouse he'll make it happen he'll lead you to be
6:15
somewhere while where you'll meet them at somewhere down the line he'll move in his miraculous hand guiding you
6:21
perfectly directing your steps but he won't do that if you're not staying in his will by seeking by
6:28
serving him doing what he's asked you to do so long story short summarize this
6:35
just keep your focus on serving God and doing what he's asked you to do and He
6:40
will order your steps he will take care of the
6:46
rest hallelujah what does Strange Fire
6:52
mean somebody warned me about strange fires someone
6:58
asks um well I would say what I'm I mean what
7:04
based on what I've seen in the like Charismatic Christian terms lingo what I've seen
7:11
like in the past how I would Define it or what I think people are meaning I don't really use that term in my
7:18
vocabulary but what I've seen it to mean by some people is
7:25
um the it the Strange Fire is in the word of God it warns about Strange Fire
7:31
but what I think they what I think people are talking about when they're saying that is
7:36
um is people walk people who are doing
7:42
Miracles or who are prophesying but it not being from the
7:48
source of God but coming from a demonic
7:54
Source uh but I I mean based on what I've seen from
8:00
a lot not all people but I've seen a lot of people use it many times in the area
8:06
of um skepticism uh you know so that like the
8:14
most times that I've seen people talk about it it's many times like in this
8:19
skeptical heart there's a lot of people that when they see God moving in a way they've never seen
8:26
before they call it weird and strange and and like weird and strange to them means bad and I read the Bible and I see
8:35
God do strange things and so I don't see strange as like a bad thing because like
8:40
I mean I mean like things that maybe don't seem kind of logical maybe don't really make sense I I read a scripture
8:47
in the Bible this past Sunday where I was like this is strange what God did I don't mean it in uh um disrespectful way
8:55
I just mean it's it's bizarre odd different um um out of the ordinary and
9:01
so one of the scriptures I read was um when God commanded Moses so first of all
9:07
God sent snakes and they were poisoning people like his wrath was coming upon
9:12
people as they were being so wicked and dis and um disobedient and then he had mercy
9:20
upon that the people and he he commanded Moses to build a like a a rod and have a
9:28
serpent on it a bronze serpent like kind of build this like statue um and and and and he said okay
9:35
tell the people to look at it to gaze at this and when they do they'll be
9:40
healed um and so that's just very different especially like comparing it
9:47
to the other ways that we see God move it it's not as like strange you know
9:53
like Moses lifting up his staff and like the power of God moving through it
9:59
that's not so strange that's pretty like epic one would call it right and um not
10:05
seen as weird or strange but just epic right um the splitting of the sea
10:11
lifting up the staff and um it's just like people would say it's witchcraft Vibes like it looks more like
10:18
witchcraft people would say about the the the serpent on the pole on the rod
10:24
that's what I mean is like the other things um are easier to swallow or
10:30
something or easier to understand easier to digest the other ways that God moves
10:35
in power and um like in Old Testament to New Testament we see a lot of like raising of the dead and healing of the
10:41
sick from Old Testament to New Testament and then New Testament casting out of demons and um it's you usually it's just
10:52
it's not that strange it's just like commanding the sick to be healed and
10:57
demons to go and the dead to raise and to rise come alive um then we do we do
11:03
see Jesus do some like strange things that are different from the majority of how God moves from Old Testament to New
11:10
Testament like Jesus spitting on someone's eyes to to open them and Jesus
11:16
spitting on dirt and making it mud and putting on their eyes so the problem is
11:21
is that today God moves in a he continues to move in however he
11:28
wants to move and in like new and different and unique ways so if God does
11:33
a if God moves in a new way to bring about healing that's like a more like strange way like
11:41
how what he told Moses to do with the the serpent on the the rod or the spitting on the eyes like if God wants a
11:49
vessel to to move in that way to to to release anointing in in like a way like that
11:57
maybe not the same as that but in that category or as unique and like why of
12:02
all things spit of all things are with a serpent right um so when when people see
12:10
that like see the different see the never seen before out of
12:16
orinary people categorize that as strange and weird and myself I don't now I I now don't
12:23
categorize strange as bad cuz the things God was doing was strange I don't mean
12:28
it disrespectful was just out of the ordinary different not like normal logical like why you choose to do those
12:35
things in our in our like culture just as Humanity in general
12:42
culture like how we do things Society whatever what we know um but
12:47
people people today many people see strange as bad I don't see strange as bad I can see God using someone in a way
12:55
I've never seen before and I can say say that's strange that's out of the ordinary but but wow awesome that's God
13:01
moving out of the box way again Hallelujah this is awesome um but then
13:08
other people will say that's strange that's weird that's bad that's demonic
13:14
that's strange fire that's what I'm trying to say like when I have seen people like warn about Strange Fire for
13:21
the most part they're they're meaning it you know you could say it in a not bad
13:27
way that's strange but they're meaning it in a negative way that just because it's something they haven't seen before
13:34
and it's different they don't they just stop right there they don't go to the
13:39
place of looking at the fruits they don't go to the place of
13:44
humility and Purity and childlike heart and like look into this like that's how we should be when we see something
13:51
different in a Ministry that we haven't seen before when we see like Miracles
13:56
happening or maybe we don't know if the mirac so we're seeing like manifestations of Supernatural power
14:03
like when we see that we shouldn't automatically become a judge become
14:09
skeptical become Harden in heart but we should immediately be childlike pure and humble
14:16
and then look at the fruits for ourselves like look okay I'm seeing manifestations and God absolutely Moves
14:22
In manifestations in Supernatural ways but the devil can too so let me look to
14:27
see if there's good fruit or bad fruit or no fruit that I can see
14:33
let me go see whenever someone sees the Power like that Supernatural things they
14:39
should like first off be like this could be God could be the devil but I'm not
14:44
going to like I'm going to first think positive this could be God what I need to do now is look to see if it is God
14:51
and how will we know the Bible says you shall know them by the fruits so now I'm going to look at the fruits we should come with that pure childlike heart like
14:58
that simple we shouldn't see manifestations we shouldn't see someone falling back when
15:04
a minister is like preaching or something and immediately be like that's God we actually should be like that
15:09
could be God and I hope so let's see let's look at the fruits with a pure humble heart when you come with a pure
15:16
humble heart with hope in your heart not Negative Nancy not looking for the bad
15:25
but just with a open slate pure childlike heart
15:32
you'll be able to see God will be able to show you this is good fruit and it's very simple it's not hard to see it's
15:38
the biggest way to see the test I mean the fruits good fruits when you're seeing that when you're seeing manifestations Supernatural
15:44
manifestations is the testimonies the testimonies and um honestly if anyone
15:51
ever sees testimonies especially if they're seen many
15:56
testimonies from people not like a minister not like me saying I healed
16:03
this person and they were healed of this and they were freed of and I prayed for this person and they were freed of this
16:09
no I'm talking about people people who actually were ministered to you're
16:16
hearing them from their own free will in their own voice say I was prayed for I
16:24
came to this ministry and God touched me and I used to be this way and now this way this is the miracle I received
16:31
that's good fruit and so um when one sees
16:38
that one really should not should not judge one should it's really mindblowing
16:45
actually really really bad that people do these exposed videos and judge
16:53
and everything when there's all this good fruit like if someone really feels
16:58
in their um I don't know their Intuition or whatever they want to call it if they feel like something's off about this
17:07
yeah I see these Miracles but I see these testimonies but something's off I don't care how much you feel
17:14
something's off or something you better be careful when you know there's obvious
17:22
good fruit that can't be denied that you would call it from the Devil
17:29
when God doesn't make it complicated to see what's of him what's good fruit it's
17:35
really better you be quiet it's really better one is one does
17:41
not speak against you know so the I mean the Bible Wars about do not speak against the
17:47
anointed so when you're seeing good fruit even if someone's feeling whatever
17:53
whatever they want to feel intuition whatever that something's off or something
17:59
you better be careful you know and people just aren't these days and it's
18:05
very dangerous in the spiritual realm because you're opening yourself up
18:11
to to to the devil to come and attack and I mean you're opening up the door
18:17
when you speak against what is of God's you're opening up the door it's in a big
18:24
way in a big way so um many times people that are I just feel like something's
18:31
off most time many times it's number one it's that they themselves aren't humble
18:38
and childlike they themselves are skeptical and judge and judgmental so they're looking for the Bad and the
18:44
devil uses that like and and the Bible talks about Jesus says I I praise you father for revealing these things from
18:51
those who are prideful um and only revealing it to the childlike so that that shows that that's
18:58
why I said when you when you have humble when you're humble and childlike and pure and you go and look at the
19:04
fruits God will speak to you God will show you he's able to open your eyes he's able to speak to you clearly
19:10
because you are humble that's how you receive in spiritual Insight you cannot receive
19:16
spiritual Insight from God when you are not humble so people they come with pride and they'll hear and listen to
19:22
testimony videos and as they're watching and hearing it's like they're getting
19:28
these weird weird feelings inside which is the enemy like when you're judgmental and skeptical you're opening yourself up
19:34
to the open the door opening up the door for the devil to influence your thoughts and your emotions and give you funky
19:41
feelings and whatever um you know and on top of that you can't
19:48
see you can't see like wow that person
19:53
is now free wow Jesus like you you can't that
19:59
can't happen because you you're God only opens up the eyes to those who are
20:05
humble that's why people of people of the world whether you like Pharisee or whether you're like
20:11
atheist they're not impressed by the precious miracles of god they're like
20:17
the Pharisees who when a person was was born blind and now could see they could
20:23
not rejoice and instead they were like but Jesus he the one who prayed for you though he's he's a false prophet and the
20:30
the person who's blind like I don't care if he's a sinner I don't care all I I
20:36
don't know if he's a sinner I all I know is I once was blind and now I can see
20:42
and the Pharisees just wouldn't have it I mean they just they were just like whatever we're not excited about that we
20:50
cuz they couldn't see that's that's why that's how the people are in the world that's why the the people who are
20:57
prideful skeptical that's why they're that way that like hardened heart they
21:03
can't see they can't see the Beautiful Jesus in this the beautiful works of
21:09
Jesus because they're choosing to block themselves from seeing the
21:14
spiritual truth yeah so today anyways I I see a
21:22
lot of that when I see for the most part when I'm seeing not always not always but because there can be there can
21:28
absolutely be people who I mean the Bible talks about um the Bible talks
21:34
about there's a scripture that says you know there will be people that
21:41
when they die Jesus will say I never knew you and they're like what do you mean you never
21:47
knew me I cast out demons I prophesied I did all these things what do you mean you never knew me and um it's those
21:55
people it's actually those people that are that are Pharisees like the Pharisees
22:01
were continuing to do the work of God they they they they they when Jesus came on the scene and they were like um
22:08
exposing him as a false prophet with in their eyes they thought they were doing God a favor they thought they were literally doing the work of
22:16
God that's I mean Paul who be Paul who used to be Saul he thought he was doing
22:23
the work of God when he was persecuting and killing Christians so if
22:29
if if Paul never became Paul like if he chose to not repent when he was
22:37
Saul when he died he would have been he would have gotten that answer from from
22:43
God Saul would have said but but but God I I defended your work your word your
22:51
the word of God and all of these false gospels and false prophets I expose them
22:58
and I I I shut them down their Ministries down so your truth could be
23:03
safe and people wouldn't be deceived um so what do you mean you didn't know me
23:09
God yeah so so those those are the people that they think they're doing God
23:14
a favor they think they're doing the work of God and um it can get more complex where the enemy can I
23:22
mean the devil has demonic Powers so I mean demons can play around
23:29
just because you see manifestation that shouldn't like impress you it's the I mean that shouldn't like impress you of
23:35
this is Jesus it should be the testimonies and then when you see the testimonies then you should be enamored
23:42
and in awe of the beautiful power of God that makes demons scream and makes um
23:49
the person fall back with the power of God like like whenever I see God move in
23:54
that kind such power I rejoice joice and I give him glory and I get so excited
24:02
that he's revealed to the world in such a tangible way because that's what happened for me my eyes open up to God's
24:08
realness and his love and his sovereignty and His Majesty like never
24:14
before like this is God right like when when I see God moving the the
24:19
supernatural power of God making people fall down with this power and these Supernatural things happen and it's like
24:26
it's like God's like I am the Lord like I am God like you know like it's just
24:32
he's revealing how powerful he is you know how he's so much bigger than all of
24:39
us than any kind of King on this world or leader or celebrity or power he's so
24:47
much bigger so I I I get so excited to
24:52
see the Manifest manifest power of God and we should too but we should get
24:58
excited and rejoice in it and and and and say this is evidence of God once
25:03
we've seen the testimonies and we know it's God you know so just because you're
25:09
seeing a super manif Supernatural manifestation it doesn't mean 100% it's
25:16
God it could be the devil and his demonic Powers doing some funky things doing
25:22
some strange fire things you know so that that is absolutely a thing
25:29
but the problem is is that for the most part um that language or whatever that I've
25:36
noticed is coming in a negative connotation like accusing as Jesus was accused of using demonic powers to cast
25:42
out demons so we got to be careful um with listening to people like with those
25:49
like warnings and everything because by and large this is the thing this is what I've seen there are there are false
25:55
prophets and there are there is the devil messing around and people that are
26:01
coming in the name of Jesus even having a big Ministry are not really sent from
26:07
Jesus and are having other funky motives um motives of Fame of attention of power
26:14
of money um and the devil's working with that like you know the devil loves that
26:20
so he can he can even cause Supernatural manifestations type things to happen
26:28
okay but the thing is is that that's a minority the the ones that actually get
26:34
to that level of having a a big platform that's such a minority compared to the
26:41
true Servants of God walking in the power of God it is such a minority but
26:46
and then on the other side you're having um so many false accusations about
26:53
Strange Fire so many false false accusations towards true Servants of God
26:59
saying this is a false prophet when they're not so it's really important for
27:05
you to realize this for the body of Christ to realize this to not have that
27:11
like spirit of fear and skepticism and Pharisee Spirit thinking that there's so
27:19
many false prophets here deceiving so that you are skittish anytime you
27:26
see a man estation of God's power or uh tons of people flocking to a Ministry to
27:34
receive Miracles there's people like that that are like oh the second so so
27:40
many people are flocking to receive Miracles it's got to be false it's so bad it's so bad it's the spirit of the
27:48
it's the spirit of the Pharisees so um it's so important for us to understand that um that it's really
27:54
the minority that um that are false and when you have this and like I said from the
28:01
beginning when you have a pure and childlike heart it'll be it won't be difficult to discern that there aren't
28:08
good fruits there especially as God leads you to
28:13
where he really is and where good fruits are and what you really know good fruits are like when you've really tasted what
28:19
humility in a leader looks like for example when you've really tasted what
28:25
good fruits really are cuz a lot of people don't know you know but when God has led you to where he is moving where
28:32
he's called you to be planted you've tasted the fruits you've tasted the fruits in your own personal life of how you've seen transformation and so now
28:39
when you go and look if you if God is calling you to discern Elsewhere for some reason you'll be able to really see
28:46
discern I know what good fruit is and I'm not seeing this here for example how do we
28:53
approach doctors especially surgeons to tell them the truth that only God can
29:01
heal so this is the first question um and also surgery chemo ET
29:08
are not necessary anymore or can it still be used by God to heal uh so I actually want to answer the
29:14
the second question first um God doesn't want us to throw away doctors and
29:20
hospitals and surgeries and treatments and um it's really different
29:26
and depends on the person a person's personal life and their walk
29:32
with God and where they are in their walk with God and so like God doesn't like punish people
29:40
for not having their faith at a higher level
29:45
yet by that I mean like you know when a when a when a when
29:51
a faith is at a really high level and
29:56
um you know you're like I know I don't you know there was the woman that
30:02
testified recently that she like she rejected chemo and God ended up healing her and so her faith was at a high level
30:10
and it was beautiful and that's what God wanted her to do for his glory to show
30:16
that um he is the ultimate healer over any kind of science over any kind of
30:22
medicine that he's higher and he's better you know the healing he can bring comes without side effects like you know
30:29
chemo and other things they can come with really bad side effects
30:34
and like harm the body you know and so there's times that God really wants to
30:39
reveal that God really wants to show that but it's not like it's there's this
30:44
doctrine that is the same for everybody like God wants everyone to reject all
30:50
medicine and treatments so that he can show that he's higher above them all for
30:57
every person in in every circumstance it he wants to do that but it's going to
31:02
depend on the situation and the person and the faith of the person so I what I
31:08
meant was like God doesn't punish people because their faith isn't at a certain level yet or something because our faith
31:14
is so important for the Miracles to take place God doesn't just force a miracle the Faith's got to be there and so you
31:21
know treatment and things from the doctor can be a you know from medicine
31:27
can be a blessing some sometimes when it's the person's not ready to go 100%
31:34
completely in the spiritual 100% spiritual route yet for for example and
31:40
um and I and I also don't mean that once you're at this high level spiritual level that that means that okay you've
31:47
reached this point so you never should go to a doctor again you don't need to go to a doctor again you never should
31:52
step into a hospital again you should never receive any kind of treatment again like um
31:59
no you know I mean that's that's that's not that's not
32:05
how it is um and so like here's here's an example sometimes it's like important
32:11
to know what's going on in your body and that's a important thing of why we have doctors and doctor's appointments and
32:18
everything like um sometimes something's going on with
32:24
your body because maybe you are not eating the right Foods right maybe
32:31
you're not getting enough nutrients in your body and so your body's acting up in a certain way and so that's not an
32:37
issue of God needing to do a miracle in your body that's an issue of someone who
32:42
has expertise can maybe do tests and help you see you're you're not taking
32:48
care of your body in the way that you should to so that your body can function
32:54
how it's supposed to right you know and so so um maybe when you go to the doctor
33:00
the doctor reveals the issue and also the doctor reveals you know you're missing this nutrient you know you're
33:06
not you're not eating enough vegetables or something like that let's just say this for example and so in that
33:13
situation God doesn't want you to you know not use your brain at all
33:20
and and ignore the fact that you're in a human body and just pretend you're an angel in heaven no he wants you to walk
33:26
in wisdom and take care of the body that you that he has given
33:33
you um and so it's not the spiritual thing to call on God to heal your body
33:38
in that area it's the spiritual thing to do of uh eat vegetables and so your body
33:44
that God gave you can operate how it's supposed to you know what I'm trying to say that's just one little example um
33:51
but just to say it in general it's not it's it's important we
33:56
don't see like medicine in doctors and hospital is a bad thing and
34:02
um sometimes sometimes one's Faith isn't ready yet and it's totally cool it's
34:07
totally cool with God for someone to go through with a surgery or a treatment and then God will meet them in that and
34:13
God will still be with them in that and God's hand will be upon them in that and God's hands will be upon the surgeons for example and his Supernatural power
34:21
will still be there um you know and then as time goes on if
34:26
their faith can be stretched their faith can grow more they can get to the point where they really experience this
34:33
huge um huge miracle in their body that the doctors are confounded by but the
34:40
first question how do we approach doctors especially surgeons to tell them the truth that only God can
34:45
heal so um we shouldn't Force anything on anybody when it comes to spiritual eyes
34:52
we can't force that and that can be frustrating sometimes because we're like we just want people to know know the
34:58
truth because the truth is what sets you free ah right but we have to be patient
35:04
we have to do things God's way he doesn't force himself there are so many people who are not saved today
35:11
and they're destined to go to hell currently until they they change their
35:16
decision and Anything Could Happen they could die any day like that's a huge reality right but still god of the
35:24
universe lets them choose lets them continue to not be saved lets
35:32
them right now to choose their path of living in Hell For Eternity on earth now and for eternity he gives free will it's
35:40
just how it is he's pursuing them he's pursuing them he's pursuing them with his love but he still gives them Free
35:47
Will so the truth of the matter is is that not everybody's going to heaven and in the same way not everybody is going
35:54
to their eyes are going to open up to the truth simply because because God has given us Free Will and um so when it
36:00
comes to speaking about all the things of the kingdom and what God has open your eyes up too it's important to
36:08
understand that we all have free will that everybody has free will so we
36:14
want as much as we want to like beat people over the head with the truth we're not called to do that
36:20
because it's the kindness of God that leads to repentance not forcefulness kindness
36:26
gentleness um so we're to plant seeds and then when plant seeds for Jesus in
36:31
the faith and when um people respond to those seeds choose to respond to the
36:38
seeds uh then God will lead you to go further
36:44
and like Rel release More release more Pearls of the
36:49
Kingdom don't give pearls to swines release Pearls of the Kingdom as God is
36:56
leading you to release them and going to be to those who have hearts ready to hear Hearts ready to learn Hearts ready
37:03
to receive the pearls and Steward them and release what they've been given to others rather than throwing them in the
37:11
trash so as the Bible says don't give Pearls of swine pigs so um I just share
37:18
that to start off with is that uh majority I mean probably for the most
37:26
part um for the most part when it comes to to
37:32
doctors they they carry us a a little different of a hindrance uh leading to humility because
37:40
they have been deemed the professionals and the area of of health and
37:48
science they've been awarded that they are professionals and so they have been
37:53
raised up in society as I don't want to say God but like um they've just been
38:00
lifted so when you're not a doctor it's going to probably you're not lifted to that area of I'm a professional in the
38:06
area of Health and Science and how things work in the physical body and everything that God does like with his
38:13
miraculous power just tears that all apart you know I mean because in science
38:19
and and Medicine a plus b equals c like everything fits in a box and is
38:26
logical and like cancer does not just disappear like things like that like no
38:32
room for miracles um when those things happen they're just
38:39
like oh we can't explain it we don't know we're going to focus on what we do know like that's the minority that's the
38:44
outlier when when when an act of God they call it happens or um unexplained
38:50
Act of I don't know I think they call it something I feel like it's something like that in the medicine field you know
38:56
but they teach you that that is something rare and they're not supposed to like um practice based upon that
39:05
where if you're a Believer that's like your foundation is is is the miraculous power
39:11
of God so it's like opposite right so um so
39:17
yeah so anyways like you have to be aware of that you know I think you're in the field of medicine like you have to
39:22
be aware of that that they are having to overcome a different kind of hindrance in the are of humility in this area of
39:30
God the Healer who does all kinds of Miracles when it comes to health of the physical
39:35
body and mind um so quick answer what can you do what can
39:42
you do just plant seeds of love just like if they're co-workers for example
39:47
just be loving to them and be kind and if they want to if they see you as
39:52
someone like they trust because you've been showing love to them then they may open up to you more in life and that may
40:00
lead you to be able to share your testimony to be able to share for
40:06
example you know if they're curious if they show curiosity and openness to your
40:11
faith in Jesus to maybe what you're so passionate about like maybe you're able
40:16
because now you're more like on friend term friendly terms they've opened up to you maybe they're like they you know you
40:22
can't help but talk about what you're so passionate about your church and so so maybe they're like oh well what's what's
40:30
happening there why are you so passionate about it and you can say well let me just show you an example and you show the testimony video of of the
40:37
precious woman who was healed of stage four metastatic cancer on hospice you can show them this you can say look at
40:44
this this is a miracle this is the god that I believe in you know that is planting a seed and
40:52
so you don't have to feel like you have to give them a whole sermon and be like yes I've been wanting to show you this
40:58
and I'm going to blow your mind right now let me give you the sermon about Jesus the Healer like if they're open to
41:04
that amen but make sure they're open to it start by planting seed start by planting that seed of sharing the
41:10
testimony if they're open to it and um don't worry don't don't I mean
41:16
don't don't don't let it can be grieving it can be grieving when you know like
41:21
the answer of Jesus is right there and is available and people are missing it I
41:26
know it can be hard but make sure you just don't
41:32
take a weight on that God doesn't want you to take like know your assignment to
41:37
plant seeds to show love and that you are making such a big difference of planting seeds and maybe you won't see
41:43
the Harvest in your lifetime but but or or or or or your season at that um place
41:49
where you're uh workplace but it is a seed that has planted been planted and it will harvest
41:56
later and by the way way this revival we have seen nothing yet Hallelujah it is
42:03
just the very beginning of what God's going to do I mean I'm I'm talking
42:08
this this this miraculous Jesus that so many people don't know about he is
42:14
revealing himself in such a big way to the masses like we have never seen
42:19
that's what's coming that's what's coming it will be talked about all over it'll be talked about in the news it's
42:26
it's not you know you see um you see like mainstream Christianity and you see
42:31
sometimes like mainstream Christian leaders um sometimes speaking on the on
42:38
the mainstream secular news outlets and stuff and the the topic of conversation
42:45
is usually just the topic of faith and that's it not not really so much about
42:50
the miraculous power of God you don't really see that it's like taboo right
42:56
but a big reason Reon is because um mainstream Christianity by and large is
43:02
missing the anointing and so they're actually not even seeing demons be cast out and much many if if any people being
43:09
healed so they're not even want going to talk about it right well this is where
43:15
things are going to change this is where things are going to change they're going to change they're going to change soon
43:21
or we're going to start seeing this and um I'm so hopeful I just I'm so hopeful
43:28
actually prophetically for God to use unlikely people Gentiles
43:35
like the you know like the Jewish people were supposed to be the ones that received
43:40
Jesus they were the um the Believers in that day the Believers of God but they
43:47
wouldn't receive Jesus but then the Samaritan woman so she's a gentile she's
43:54
secular person not a churchgoer living in sin doing really
44:01
worldly things and she has a real encounter with the power of Jesus with
44:07
Jesus and his prophetic Ministry prophetic anointing just changes her life and
44:15
she's the one that spreads the news far and wide and um about Jesus and then so
44:21
then many come to him and receive him and and she was the one that started the first great heart the first Revival I
44:28
mean I mean she's the one that spread the news about it like God used her to open up the doors
44:34
um like uh because because in the gospels when it when when you see that
44:40
Bible story happening right when she leaves and like runs and goes and tells everybody we see that Jesus turning to
44:46
his disciples who were going to get food and missed that whole they weren't there for that like whole experience with the Samaran woman at the well and he says
44:53
you think the Harvest is a long ways away like months from now but I tell you it's the Harvest is ripe
44:59
now um because he knew that God was Now using this worldly woman secular woman
45:06
to open up the door for uh Revival to break out for the Harvest to come in and
45:12
so I'm you know the Bible is alive today I I I I've seen so many um Pharisees of
45:21
today so many people who are supposed to receive Jesus moving how wants to move
45:27
in his new way and his new wine that aren't there aren't they aren't receiving and so I I am hopeful you know
45:34
even as time goes on and I continue to see more and more of that um more and more of that like rejection
45:41
by the people that ones that supposed to be on the front lines the first ones accepting him I become excited to see
45:49
the Bible come alive to see a modern day Samaritan woman at the well to see God
45:54
confound us to confound the wisdom of this world World by using foolish things weak and foolish things people who are
46:01
not churchgoers you know worldly people um but they encounter the power of God
46:08
and they become saved and become just so transformed and and just can't stop
46:15
talking about this Jesus they encountered in power and they they they get real loud about it
46:22
hallelujah hallelujah so anyways you know you're going to be planting seeds that God is going to be using later on
46:30
you know like when it becomes talked about far and wide about what God's doing where people even see it on the
46:36
news and they just can't deny it Harvest will come in Hearts from seeds that you even planted right now so have hope know
46:44
that what you're doing is so powerful these planting of seeds and don't worry about the timeline of when they come to
46:50
harvest how to set boundaries with your parents whose love language is giftgiving and it takes attention off of
46:55
the reason for a holiday like Easter and bringing a spirit of greed into your children's
47:02
lives um I would say when it comes to family members like when you know it's a
47:07
safe place in terms of it being family it's okay to receive gifts I mean like you shouldn't we don't need to be
47:14
receiving gifts from random people that have like bad intentions and motives and want to manipulate you that's what I
47:20
mean by that but if you know someone like your parents even if um maybe they're not spiritually as as mature as
47:27
you but but it's safe you know it's just they're doing it out of love like you're saying that it's their love language to
47:34
give um you know it's true giving gifts can really be a love language for people
47:40
I think we've all experienced in some sense like the the love we have for a
47:45
person and then we want to give them a gift maybe it's Christmas or something or was just on our heart to give them a
47:50
gift maybe they have really been wanting something and we get we get excited we
47:56
get so excited to bless them and that's beautiful you know that's that's a
48:01
beautiful Act of love and done in the spirit of love if that's the case you
48:08
know um there can be differences of someone doing it in spirit of manipulation someone doing it in the
48:14
spirit of um wanting to show off or whatever but in general like if if that's the
48:20
heart behind it it's a beautiful thing okay and so there's some people that
48:25
that that really is like how they feel in their hearts to show love and so you
48:30
know if it's someone like your parents it's it's okay it's okay you don't need to feel like it's going to
48:36
be something bad spiritually that's taking place because maybe it will show
48:43
your kids that they're entitled or something like that um but but really if
48:49
you're if you're concerned about like greed because it's like a lot of presentence or something and you don't want your kids to think
48:55
like they should expect this type thing just talk with them you know just talk
49:00
with them just share with them like you know this is what Easter is really about
49:06
and we don't need to give gifts it's not about that at all so I want you to be
49:12
fine if no gift was ever come and never came you know even if even if they're
49:18
little you can you can speak to them in a way they'll understand um just making
49:23
them know what Easter is really about and that um you were giving these gifts because
49:30
you're loved so much not cuz you're you know this should be an
49:37
expectation just you should feel
49:42
like this is just how it is on Easter you know but this is done out of love so
49:47
it's important you're grateful for these things it's also important for you to know that Easter is nothing to do with
49:55
gifts but this is the real reason of what Easter is about this is the real reason we celebrate and we come together
50:02
as a family and you share with them about what Jesus has done for us on the cross and the power of the
50:08
resurrection and you just really take that time to share that with them and that will teach them that will plant
50:14
powerful seeds in them and continue to talk with them every year and remind them and I mean if you're worried about
50:21
greed or something too you can say well we got to get rid of some maybe some old
50:26
toys or something we're going to be giving these to those who those to children in need or example you've
50:32
received these so we're going to we don't need to have too many things when you know you can have a conversation
50:37
with them like that so that they really understand and it helps to mold them to have Christlike Hearts can you explain
50:44
the verse that says the heart is deceitful Above All Things yes and actually I will share
50:51
this a little bit but I want to I want to advise you to go to my my life live stream I'm trying to
50:57
remember the title of it and when it was if anyone remembers help me out I think it
51:04
was it was recently was it last week I taught in depth about the heart is
51:09
deceitful above all things but anyways I'm going to share right now um this is generally speaking
51:16
of okay when you are very spiritually mature and transformed into the image of Christ everything changes about you like
51:23
transform more into the image of Christ image of Jesus so your mind becomes so much more like
51:29
Jesus your your your attitude becomes so much more like Jesus and your heart
51:36
becomes so much more like Jesus naturally so your heart can be trusted
51:41
more in those times so this this scripture is is speaking more to
51:48
um more for like when you're not very very mature in Christ um and are so our
51:56
feelings and thoughts many times are influenced by the enemy the enemy can be planning just a thought and
52:03
a feeling that comes and um oh I think I think I remember speaking about it on a
52:08
Sunday like a few weeks ago that's what's coming to my mind right now I think it was when I was wearing
52:13
the pink Blazer that's just was like popping up in my mind right now um but I'm I forget what the exact title was
52:20
but um I think it might have been talking about God's will saying in the will of God in every season perhaps
52:25
God's will is not always fun and so um sometimes we can feel like we feel like
52:34
the fun like the things of God that are fun and good and amazing and his will
52:39
it's it's beautiful it's comfortable it's fun it's intoxicating
52:45
it's all good things but then sometimes the will of God make it's not always fun
52:51
it's sometimes uncomfortable sometimes it's in a Wilderness God takes us through a Wilderness season Valley of shadow of death Holy Spirit Led Jesus
52:59
Into the Wilderness to be tempted that was not fun that was not comfortable so if you put yourself in
53:05
Jesus's shoes when you led by the Holy Spirit um there'd be certain feelings in
53:10
the heart there'd be certain feelings in the heart of [Music] um this is going to be so awful and
53:19
awful does not equal God this is going to be so excruciating and painful but God is peace and joy and so sometimes
53:29
one can get confused by the feelings they're having in their
53:34
heart Jesus said I mean he was sweating sweating uh
53:40
sweating blood in the Garden of Gethsemane because he knew what he was about to endure on the
53:46
cross and um that was not fun that was
53:51
not uncom that was not comfortable that was going to be really painful excruciating that was not going to be
53:58
happy joyful like H like woo um good
54:04
times and so many times with God are that way good times and
54:11
comfortable and the happiest feelings we ever feel um and uh but but Jesus said
54:19
if I don't uh if you can take this cup from me but not my will let yours be done so his heart was saying
54:27
I don't want this but Jesus was spiritually mature enough to know that
54:33
the heart can't be trusted that the feelings don't equal God's voice so his
54:39
feelings were were not lining up with God's voice the feelings from the heart were not lining up with God's voice but
54:46
spiritually his Spirit like the truth he lived in that I must follow the will of
54:51
the father that's what he trust that's what was was reigning higher than the
54:57
heart and so like his his surrender and commitment to the father of of I just
55:03
want to be in your will in good times and bad like when it's fun when it's not fun and I just want to be in your will
55:11
no matter what like his Spirit saying yes to that that could be trusted God's
55:17
will can be trusted his Covenant with God I just want God's will that can be trusted heart can't be trusted the heart
55:23
can't be trusted so the feeling saying no do I do not want to do this this is
55:32
not going to be good that can't be trusted the heart is
55:38
deceitful that's the meaning that's the meaning so so many times um because I mean so much of life
55:45
with God I mean we we live in we can live in peace and joy continually but peace and joy doesn't always equal the
55:52
Happy Feelings it can be like you're in the Val of the shadow of death but you know
55:58
God is with you so you don't have fear and you have hope and so therefore
56:03
there's peace there's peace the the hope that you have the promise of God that this is
56:12
just temporary that you will pass through the valley of the shadow of death that it's just temporary and the promises will come to pass the Hope in
56:20
that a and that that's a great peace that comes and the
56:26
the assurance that God's presence that he's with you through this the comfort
56:33
in that that removes all fear and so that peace that comes of not having fear
56:39
and having hope that's what brings peace and joy and that trumps trumps that that peace
56:46
and joy trumps feelings of unhappiness feelings of discomfort so that's how you can
56:53
really be maintaining your peace and joy you still have have the discomfort you still have the not fun you still have
56:59
the pain but the peace and joy that's there trumps
57:05
it when you really lean into the spirit seek Jesus choose to be spiritual choose to
57:12
focus on the truth choose to not neglect and forget the promises of God and the reality the spiritual reality that God's
57:18
with you even if you don't like feel it but knowing he's with you okay so um but
57:24
anyways uh a lot of people I mean so much of our walk with God we are feeling the peace we are feeling the joy like we
57:30
are feeling so happy much of the time that's how it is even in in my life like
57:36
most of the time I'm genuinely feeling happy I'm genuinely feel like not just I
57:41
have joy but I feel happy and have joy um and have peace that's me most of
57:50
the time like the feelings woo Hallelujah
57:56
but then there are times that you don't feel it but you I still have the peace and joy but I don't feel it and I feel
58:02
pain and I feel discomfort and it's not fun and so if people aren't spiritually
58:08
mature they can they can think well most of my life is happy because I have Jesus
58:16
and now I don't feel happy so this must not be God's will this isn't fun this is
58:22
uncomfortable so this must not be God's will cuz most of my life is happy that's
58:29
that's wrong that's being carnal that's being spiritual that's when the heart can be deceitful so the verse isn't
58:36
saying like the heart is so evil it's that you got to be careful that your
58:41
feelings don't mislead you don't trust them trust God trust the
58:48
spirit of God trust the truth the God's word trust the truth he's revealed to
58:55
you TR trust the covenants you made with God like God I will follow you no matter what God the co the covenants he's LED
59:01
you to make the covenants he's LED you to make like the covenants of
59:10
um the Covenant that you're to be planted in where he's planted you to be
59:15
in that you're that you will follow your Elijah up today like trust that because
59:20
you you know God LED you to make that and then the the devil wants you to break that for sure and so things will
59:27
come attacks will come don't trust the feelings of the heart like when when things come to try to shake that try to
59:33
pull you trust that Covenant that God like lean into that lean into the truth
59:39
that you know the the TRU the the areas you know God LED you to to walk in the
59:45
covenants he led you to make oh it was saying in the will of God in every season that's what the
59:52
um the message was the sermon where I talk more about that as well it's on YouTube do you think Pharisees
59:59
were narciss narcissistic absolutely yeah I mean narciss I mean narcissism from what I understand means
1:00:07
like nobody can't tell you nothing right like no humility
1:00:13
to receive wisdom advice to be [Music]
1:00:19
wrong yeah the problem is humility that's the the real problem with narcissism cuz that you know with
1:00:26
humility God reveals so if the more prideful you become the more you're
1:00:32
shutting off shutting yourself off to seeing and hearing the truth so you live
1:00:37
in your own reality in your own world in your own truth that's that's not the truth and that you you leave no room no
1:00:45
door open for the truth to enter so you are completely
1:00:51
convinced that you are right human knows we are all human and God is Lord and he
1:00:59
he and no matter how important we are no matter the title God gives us calling
1:01:05
important calling God gives us it does not make us God if we aren't God that
1:01:12
means that we are so small I mean it means that he has chosen
1:01:19
to not reveal everything to us so it means there's a lot of things we don't know which therefore it means we are
1:01:27
lifelong students servant is never greater than its
1:01:33
Master which means we could be wrong in some areas students aren't perfect right they're Learners Learners don't know
1:01:41
everything and can have preconceived wrong Notions about things and get have
1:01:48
learned things wrong so that's the attitude that we should have of
1:01:54
humility forever when we keep that attitude then
1:02:00
we will live in the truth God will be able to constantly reveal the truth to
1:02:06
us so we grow bigger and bigger in wisdom at Salvation doesn't God give us
1:02:12
a new heart like his the the soul is the mind the will
1:02:18
and emotion so we're given a new spirit but the soul isn't new the soul
1:02:24
has to be transformed so that means that our mind can
1:02:31
sometimes have carnal thoughts have wrong thoughts of wrong thinking and sometimes our heart can have wrong
1:02:37
feelings can have jealous feelings can have um
1:02:43
doubt can have um anger things like this
1:02:49
and sometimes it's demons that are holding back the heart from being pure
1:02:56
and sometimes it's it's not demons but
1:03:01
it's a carnal nature dirt that needs to come
1:03:08
out wrong ways of thinking needs to come out of the mind and heart for it to be
1:03:14
clean and pure and transformed um and sometimes it's
1:03:19
both and so as we renew our mind with the word of God submit to God reject the
1:03:25
devil take all our thoughts captive to Christ and we do all that God's calling
1:03:30
us to do like be planted where his anointing can touch us through teaching to open our eyes and help us and equip
1:03:37
us and receive the anointing over our lives to free us and and to to help build up our spirit man as we do all the
1:03:44
things he's calling us to do staying in the word of God um closing all the doors as we do all those
1:03:49
things he transforms us he cleans the heart day by day by day by day so you
1:03:56
you you can be saved and and still have you know a lot of jealous feelings a lot
1:04:01
of selfish feelings um a lot of anger feeling sometimes and this can be when
1:04:06
even when you don't have demons but you just like have these natural feelings but as you seek God keep the Bible says
1:04:12
it's like we're looking at a mirror and we are being transformed like his Reflections coming upon us so as we do
1:04:19
these things as we surrender daily as we do all the things he's calling us to do as we be this Warrior of God to to renew
1:04:26
our mind reject the devil take thoughts captive to Christ speak his word speak his truth the transformation takes place
1:04:32
he cleans us the cleaning takes place so like those jealous thoughts diminish the selfish thoughts diminish the the like
1:04:38
the natural feelings we have jealous feelings diminish anger the natural
1:04:44
anger will feel towards someone like whether you act on or not anger anger feeling diminishes and so over time it's
1:04:53
this Pure Heart that matches the spirit because your spirit is completely pure is the
1:05:00
righteousness of God is one with the spirit but now your heart can match even
1:05:06
your body can match like your I mean every part of you is is is being cleaned
1:05:12
and transformed and shining in the glory of God from within to outside your your
1:05:19
whole self being transformed even like like by the body I
1:05:24
mean like as you're so submitted to God and surrendered you start to like eat how he want you start to take care of
1:05:30
your temple and eat right and sleep right and drink right drink water I mean like drink water enough and like get
1:05:37
exercise and stuff and so your body even is like is is functioning better and
1:05:43
looking better and it's healthier because what how you're treating it and everything so everything becomes
1:05:48
transformed into the image of Jesus you know Jesus on this earth when he was he
1:05:54
was 100% human but he was shining the glory of God I'm sure because he was surrendered in the area of taking care
1:06:00
of his Temple too so we can look like his family like we're related even as he
1:06:07
was physically on this Earth in terms of how um we shine in every way inwardly
1:06:13
and outwardly when someone has the religious spirit and tries to challenge you on things is it best to not talk
1:06:19
about Jesus with them don't give pearls to swine mhm so you have precious
1:06:26
pearls these precious pearls are so precious your the pearls that God's
1:06:32
given you are the revelations about his kingdom the truth and the way he's opened up your eyes like those are the
1:06:39
revelations you carry and now your life's different because of what he's giv you because of the revelations he's
1:06:46
given you about him and his kingdom and it's led to all these Miracles taking place in your life it's
1:06:52
led to you being able to receive it's led to your faith rising up and you being able to abide by his principles
1:07:00
like such as being planted where the power of God is and receiving there like how he's opened up your eyes you're
1:07:05
you're doing things in line with his his principles and that's leading to so many
1:07:11
miracles in your life and transformation in your life and so it all comes down to pearls
1:07:16
Revelations how your eyes have opened up you carry these pearls these
1:07:22
Revelations um as you Steward them well by releasing them what I'm talking about
1:07:28
like one-on-one conversation wise by releasing them to those who won't throw them in the trash but those who will
1:07:35
receive them with value then that brings a blessing and joy into your life you get to experience
1:07:42
the joy of God using you to bring transformation in someone's life and their eyes opening up and and and and
1:07:51
and and from there they will then release those pearls to other people and so that is bringing such reward and
1:07:58
blessing and and joy upon your life so stewarding those pearls well is a
1:08:05
wonderful thing is a blessing to your life but if you throw your pearls to
1:08:12
swine when they throw them in the trash that breaks your heart that makes you
1:08:17
sad that Grieves you it could also make you question they can plant bad seeds in
1:08:24
you they can say these aren't pearls this is strange fire this is demonic
1:08:31
this is false and let me tell you why let me give you all this scripture and
1:08:37
all this Pharisee nonsense they can throw back at you so you you just watch
1:08:44
them throw your pearls your precious pearls into the trash and that's really sad and you just
1:08:52
Tak in this like hit this unnecessary hit pain that's come from that and then
1:08:59
on top of that they're throwing all of this
1:09:05
garbage and nonsense and wrong Doctrine in you and that can sometimes have a
1:09:13
negative effect where it can plant bad seeds in you and make you start to question and doubt you know like that's why I say
1:09:21
don't have coffee with the Pharisees we don't see we don't see the Disciples of Jesus having coffee with
1:09:27
the Pharisees I mean we don't see them like we don't see Jesus sending them out
1:09:33
and telling them to go on a mission to convert them we actually see them see
1:09:39
Jesus sending them out and saying if people don't receive you then Dust your
1:09:44
feet off on the the mat and leave like get out of there like don't throw your pearls to the swines go where people
1:09:51
will receive you because that's where that's where the kingdom can keep going that's where the pearls can be passed
1:09:58
and the pearls can increase and the pearls can keep going that's where more souls can be saved but if we keep on
1:10:05
beating beating on the head with these people that don't want
1:10:10
to receive it we're wasting time where others could receive it and we're being harmed unnecessarily when we could have
1:10:16
felt the blessing of seeing lives changed and transformed by releasing what God has uh what God has released to
1:10:24
us so we're we're missing people and on top of that instead of being blessed and having continual Joy one of the big ways
1:10:31
that I find such blessing and joy in my life is is just seeing people be blessed and and and by by by by the power of
1:10:38
Jesus by by my Ministry um that's one of the ways that I'm seeing so much
1:10:44
blessing and joy come in my life and that's how God wants it that's how God's releasing blessing and joy in my life
1:10:50
and so if I was not doing that mission if I was doing a different kind of mission of being on the head focusing on
1:10:57
trying to convince those who don't want to receive and and and witnessing them throw those
1:11:03
pearls in my face I would be a miserable person I'm telling you I wouldn't have energy and strength to do half the
1:11:10
ministry that I do and so therefore I wouldn't be effective in the Kingdom so it's like that that's a
1:11:18
that's a sermon for about pearls with swines why you shouldn't throw pearls to
1:11:23
swines so um you know this is the rule of
1:11:28
thumb as I shared earlier this is the principle in the kingdom of God of how to minister to
1:11:36
people the kindness the repent uh the kindness of God leads to
1:11:44
repentance people people cannot be forced people we the forcing this does
1:11:53
not bring repentance forcing I don't think it's a word but you know what I'm trying to say forcing people does not
1:11:59
bring repentance trying to convince people
1:12:06
when they don't want to hear it does not bring repentance we want repentance to
1:12:11
happen so we better not be wasting time trying to force repentance to happen and
1:12:17
going against God's principles of the kindness of God leads to repentance so what we're called to do is
1:12:24
to PL Seeds of Love and not force things just plant seeds of love to everybody
1:12:31
and God will call us to plant more seed certain areas when somebody doesn't want to receive even your seed of love maybe
1:12:38
they're on a mission to convert you into their Pharisee Doctrine you know they're not in a
1:12:44
position to even receive your your seed of Love do not even plant seeds there I mean be kind to them be loving in that
1:12:51
interaction and and and you know uh uh don't speak NE L to them but you're not
1:12:56
called to even be there anymore plant throw your seeds plant your seeds where
1:13:02
where they can be harvested where they can grow where not where it's rejection you know let the people live the life
1:13:10
they want to in their own free will let them believe what they want to believe
1:13:15
let's go to where the fields are ripe for Harvest and bring in the Harvest and
1:13:22
and there we need laborers the laborers are few let's go out to the fields where the Harvest is ripe because it is let's
1:13:28
not get distracted by by those Pharisees that don't want to receive so the rule of thumb is like if
1:13:36
someone wants to receive if they're open to receiving truth and they want to learn they're open plant seeds share
1:13:44
speak the truth but if they're not don't throw your pearls to swine can God call
1:13:50
us into a season of being real quiet yeah actually I was called into a season of being real quiet when I when I first
1:13:57
when my eyes first opened up to these principles of the kingdom of
1:14:02
God that I never knew before the principle of the power of your words the power of your words the the power of
1:14:08
life and death is in your tongue I never knew the power my tongue had until like my mid 20s when I when my eyes when I my
1:14:16
eyes began to be opened up to the power of God and and his principles like this his very foundational important
1:14:23
principles um that's really like milk but babies aren't even getting that kind of milk these days by and large but
1:14:29
things are changing Hallelujah but when I first my eyes first opened up to that I was
1:14:35
like whoa my words are that powerful
1:14:41
wow and I had such reverence for God like I didn't want to
1:14:47
ever I never even like swore at that point so it wasn't anything like that
1:14:53
and I wasn't a gossiper I never really gossiped about people but I just wanted
1:14:58
to make sure every word I said like had um purpose and would never take
1:15:07
away from somebody like I remember I had that conviction of oh my gosh I think
1:15:15
many times I would talk to people just because I mean I would talk and talk and
1:15:21
talk and I'd end up really talking and talking but the the reason why I was doing it like the motive part of the
1:15:26
motive was like it made me feel connected to them and it made me feel
1:15:31
like loved to to talk and made me feel like more connected to them like that my
1:15:37
eyes just opened up like whoa cuz I was quite a talker I'd be quite a talker with friends you know I was the one that
1:15:44
would be talking more and just it hit me my eyes and opened up like I don't need
1:15:49
to be talking unnecessarily I don't need to like just talk about things that are
1:15:55
unnecessary that aren't going to add to someone and I got that conviction of like I want my words to to carry purpose
1:16:03
I want my words to carry life not not even death but just like not nonsense like not things that don't add to
1:16:09
people's lives and so I shifted immediately like when I was with people
1:16:14
I felt convicted like I'm not going to talk just to talk I like I'm not going to I'm just going I'm
1:16:22
just I I want I want to be a bit better listener and and then I want to really be in tune with God like how does God
1:16:27
want me to encourage this person how does God want me to speak words of life into this person like let me let that be
1:16:34
in my heart and my mind when I'm with somebody when I'm with a group of people rather
1:16:40
than just going as my feelings are going and just talking with no intention
1:16:46
behind it or thought just talking whatever is coming to my mind and so I
1:16:52
became really quiet in that season um because God was really calling me to I wasn't like mute but like I was there
1:16:58
was a big difference where I became quiet and it was really good it was a
1:17:04
retraining a retraining of my mind retraining of how I interacted with people and
1:17:09
spoke um completely changed so yeah God can do that sometimes the same way he
1:17:15
did it for me I'm he's doing it for for many people it's very important to have that reset to have that re like calibration and you you have to be quiet
1:17:23
so that you can listen to people more to love them better and also so you can listen to God for what you're really
1:17:29
supposed to say and supposed to not say I just want to declare over all of you
1:17:35
here right now over all of you on this live I speak right now to those of you
1:17:41
that have been hurt by the religious spirit by those of you that have been hurt by

1:19:31
receive the truth your testimony the message of Jesus and his
1:19:36
power and his love that this that these people would come to you you would see these people
1:19:43
