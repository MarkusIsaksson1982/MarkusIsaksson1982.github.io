How to be the best mother for a child who has been rejected by his father?
0:01
how to be the best mother for a child who's been rejected by his father um
0:07
well for anyone that you've had in your life who's who's faced rejection that's
0:13
some that's a family member so whether that's you're a mother to a child or
0:18
just anyone close in your life um who's battling with rejection
0:23
God is going to bring healing through you god wants to bring healing through
0:28
you because we are vessels of God and um
0:34
if we have been rejected by everyone we are still loved by God and we are still accepted by God and that's enough that's
0:41
enough you know we don't need anyone's approval we don't need anyone's acceptance we don't need anyone's love
0:47
but God's really like that like if we can have God's love that's all we actually need um the love that comes
0:56
from other people is a blessing but the only love that we need need
1:03
is God's um and so as you know you find someone in your
1:10
life that's gone through rejection God wants to reveal his love to this person
1:16
to a child through you he wants to he wants to use you as a vessel so that they can experience this supernatural
1:23
love of God so it's not just like oh my mom loves me so much so that covers up
1:29
any other rejection or I mean that that makes up for any other any kind of
1:34
rejection I've received it's not just that but it's a supernatural love of God
1:40
that it's it's truly the love of God they're experiencing that really brings healing
1:46
so um what's important is to just you know tell this child tell the person how
1:54
much they are loved how beautiful they are made how there's nothing wrong with them but they were beautifully and
2:00
perfectly made so lovable so lovable and God loves them
2:07
and God God adores them god has chosen them god created them in their mother's
2:13
womb and um he is the king of kings and
2:18
he thinks you're perfect he actually created you how you are and so you're perfect just the way you are you're
2:24
lovable you're beautiful just to speak these words over this child over a
2:31
person who's who's had rejection this is the love of God this is the voice of God coming in the ears of that
2:41
person of that child and it's covering up the um it's it's not just covering up
2:48
it's removing and overpowering the enemy's lies that speak differently so
2:54
to really affirm this this truth this truth again and again and again so that
3:01
the voice of God is coming so much more powerfully than the voice of the enemy and as you're doing this know that it's
3:08
God speaking through you it's God's love that that person that that child is experiencing and perfect love casts out
3:16
all fear the love of God casts out every voice of the devil cast out all
3:22
rejection all lies amen
3:34
and also sharing that your sharing about their father in heaven that their father they have a father in heaven who is the
3:41
best father the most amazing father they're not fatherless but they have their father in heaven who loves them
3:48
better than anybody better than any person even better than a physical father could ever love them
3:58
can we have relationships with children who are in the old wine such as my 8-year-old brother who has been who I've
4:04
been very close with before yeah i mean if you if you are I'm not
4:10
sure how old you are Sophia but um I know you're much older i believe you're much older than an 8-year-old but you
4:18
know you are you are really you know a a child
4:23
a child is still being formed you you can't look at a child and and think like
4:32
see them as an adult you can't look at a child and see them as an adult in terms of keeping up boundaries and should I
4:39
bring this person in close you know like if there is a a child in your life that
4:46
you're close to like your your your sibling that's someone who is
4:53
who you who God wants you to be a light to and teach the truth they're
4:58
impressionable they're they're more teachable and they're not in the place
5:04
of um being like rigid and I've made up my own mind you know so
5:13
when you spend time spend time with them absolutely but you should be focusing on
5:19
like instead of like um friendship so much more of like I'm God is calling me
5:25
here to teach them to plant seeds knowing like that purpose in in their
5:31
life is it okay to have mom acquaintances for
5:37
the purpose of playdates for my kids or is that bringing in the wrong people close yeah the key word is
5:43
acquaintances you know it's just there's certain um situations like that in life
5:49
where you're doing it for the purpose you're doing it for a purpose for like a playd date for your child so that's
5:55
totally okay now just be on guard like if there is
6:00
someone really you know being used by the enemy then that might be a situation
6:06
where it might be time to to leave that certain um acquaintance relationship you
6:12
know but yeah there there's I mean whether it's workrelated
6:18
there's a playdate type thing there's going to be interactions you have with
6:23
people but they're seen as like acquaintances not close friends and that's totally okay just just be
6:30
spiritually aware um and have the right boundaries up
How to balance between being financially responsible, but not operating in the spirit of poverty
6:39
how to balance between being financially responsible spending less but not operating in this spirit of poverty
6:52
so it's really important to be to first of
6:58
all give your heart to God um in terms of your finances give give everything to
7:04
God um like really give him control of your of
7:10
your money like really really surrender that
7:16
you know rather than not really inviting him in but doing
7:23
things like robotically like okay I have to
7:28
give a tithe um and maybe just like going about how
7:34
how you usually do with finances right but like really surrender everything to
7:39
God and when you do that the Holy Spirit will move in your heart like if the Holy
7:47
Spirit really wants you to give more to be more generous in a
7:52
season for example you will feel that pull on your heart you'll feel that
7:59
strong desire and that's the Holy Spirit leading you and that will mean you know
8:06
that you don't spend money on yourself as much but it it's holy spiritled and
8:13
it's not in the area of um
8:18
it's not like you you being like oh I shouldn't spend money on myself like it's not like I I guess I should could
8:26
say religiously but you it's really the Holy Spirit leading you
8:31
um and so I will say I will say that I think I I I I see I believe I know that
8:40
God wants his people to be more generous to the work of God than they realize
8:45
more um contributing to the work of God than many Christians realize i think so
8:50
much so because of like the tithe like the 10% tithe um
8:57
you know the scripture about giving tithe I think I believe many Christians just kind of go robotically and just see
9:03
it as like this is my duty 10% like 10% goes to the church belongs to God but
9:09
the rest is mine um and as long as I don't
9:15
be frivolous be gambling be spending it on demonic things
9:21
i can do what I want with it you know I think a lot of Christians live that way
9:26
and they feel like it's 10% is more than enough and maybe that can seem like a
9:31
lot for people when especially when they have if they have a good a pretty high
9:37
income 10% can seem like a lot of money type
9:43
thing you know like oh yeah I'm good but I I know that God wants his people to be
9:50
so much more generous so much more generous than many realize than many
9:55
Christians realize for the work of God um
10:00
and I've seen this in my own personal life like I've seen um just what the
10:06
Holy Spirit leads me to give what the Holy Spirit leads me to contribute to God's work i never would imagine it
10:13
would be that much like if you could have told me that like years ago
10:20
what the Holy Spirit would be guiding me to give to his work
10:27
and like that compared to the amount I like spend on myself I would I would be
10:32
shocked you know like but it's just like happened day by day holy Spirit leading me where it's never really been a shock
10:39
it's just been like I surrendered everything to God and Holy Spirit's like I want you to give this much and then
10:45
another week goes by he's like I want you to give this much and so now it's just become normal life to
10:53
to be generous and to contribute so much to God's kingdom
10:59
um but what I mean is like be before coming into the new wine and before
11:05
stepping into my calling you know more so in the mindset of old
11:10
wine the mindset of like 10% tithe that's what I I would be like shocked
11:16
that that's really what God wanted like believers to be contributing to him i
11:23
would have been shocked back then but I'm not shocked now i'm like this makes perfect sense that we should be so
11:31
generous and that all of our money should belong to God and God the more we as we sow we reap and I've seen that
11:38
true for my life like I never could imagine that I could be that I would be giving so much to the work of God but
11:45
I'm I'm equally as I would equally have been so shocked as how much God would keep giving back and how he would keep
11:52
increasing the seed that he gives to to this to the sewer the Bible says he gives seed to the sewer and so I've I
12:00
don't lack I have abundance in my life i have I don't lack financially but it's
12:05
because of giving everything to God of being generous and giving all that he's
12:11
asking so um yeah so I say all that to say is that
12:18
like and I've shared this with with with um with you all before
12:27
but like personally me I would like love to have
12:33
at least a little backyard by now and like a house but um I just know that
12:42
in this season in this season up to this point it is God's will for me to
12:51
be the being generous at the level I am for his his work right now so um yeah so
13:00
I say that to say that's why that's why I say like I think people don't realize how much he wants he wants his people to
13:07
put his work first um a lot of people they're like in
13:13
societal norms like the societal the societal norm for me
13:20
for my life financially would not is not my life is not the societal norm is what
13:26
I should say you know um it's a sacrifice it's really a sacrifice
13:34
to serve God um and it's but like God wants to bless you here on this earth He
13:39
He wants to bless you he wants to bless you financially he wants to bless you with I know that I know that I will have
13:47
a house like like personally me I could I could have bought a house a long time ago or not like bought a house straight
13:53
up but like with um payments each month or I haven't even
13:59
looked into like I don't even I haven't even looked like into like mortgages and things like that i've only ever rented
14:04
but or rent a house you know i could have like done that a while ago could
14:09
have rented like a bigger space a while ago you know but um it's just not God's
14:16
timing for my life he wants me to sacrifice right now and he wants to bless me in his timing like he want and
14:22
and this is it's like the same thing with um revival breaking out how it took all those years like I was sacrificing a
14:30
lot i was giving up a lot i was I've sacri and I
14:35
when you walk in the anointing there's such a cost to pay and you can't even describe everything and there's some things that
14:43
God doesn't even want you to reveal but like that's part of the cost is that people don't know the full cost you know
14:49
like there's there's there's such a sacrifice that I have had to make just
14:55
in surrendering to him in every area of my life um and so I think if people
15:02
looked at me if people looked at at me back then through those four years of
15:08
waiting they would
15:13
it would be it what I what I'm trying to say is I would have to renew my mind
15:20
you know and and not feel like entitled type thing like because I you can feel
15:25
like can't I have more than this now God like even I was living in an apartment
15:31
that was um it was okay but it was like not in a
15:36
very good area and it was like small and um back then you know and um like
15:43
financially I was having I mean it was just
15:49
I was living at the bare minimum you know financially
15:55
for four and a half years um until May 30th
16:01
really when revival broke out and then abundance came and then people started to donate but like I would be asking my
16:07
parents to help support financially the ministry for all those for about almost
16:13
four years yeah for exactly almost four years like three years well yeah three
16:19
three and a half almost four years um and so I you know I would like feel like
16:28
you know God like I've sacrificed so much i've given up so much like don't I
16:34
deserve like like something like you you know the Bible says God rewards those
16:40
who diligently seek him but it's not that he rewards in in your timing it's
16:46
not that he doesn't reward in your timing i mean he rewards with his peace and joy and abundant life life with him
16:54
the the protection the life he gives you my life was beautiful back then in those four and a half years but in the
17:01
external rewards like in the blessings externally and like the finan finances
17:06
like those kinds of rewards it wasn't his timing yet but he would do that he
17:13
would do that and I and even like just hearing prophecies from my spiritual father I know of rewards coming i know
17:20
of um blessings God has in store for serving him like financial rewards and
17:28
everything like I know I know that and I I know I will I will have beautiful
17:34
house someday and everything and and and and other desires of my heart like I know that but um like societal norms
17:42
would say that I should have those things earlier and it is in my means to have those things that I want and those
17:49
aren't sinful things to have those are beautiful things to have these types of desires you know But it's all about
17:58
God's timing it's all about God's timing so like for 4 and 1/2 years
18:08
um I'm just not seeing any kind of
18:14
like external I guess you could say blessing or like I'm not seeing any like forward movement so it feels like I'm in
18:21
the same place for 4 and 1/2 years so it feels like where's the reward for serving God type thing you know but then
18:29
after 4 and 1/2 years on May 30th 4 years ago
18:34
blessings upon blessings and rewards and I I had the the reward and blessing of
18:42
being able to minister all around the world every single week I started traveling to different states and then
18:50
countries in four years ago in the summertime it was 2021
18:56
um that reward the reward of like God taking care of that all and all taking
19:02
care of that all financially and actually in that year that fall after revival broke out in May May 30th 2021
19:09
that fall because there was now went from a lack financially to now
19:16
more than enough financially I could then move into an apartment it was then
19:23
time God's timing a different apartment nicer apartment where I am now it was God's timing
19:29
so um so yeah that that same like I I remind
19:36
myself of that now like when I am hungry for um when I'm hungry for rewards and
19:45
blessings from God that have been prophesied that I thought would have
19:50
happened by now i remind myself of those four and a half years up until May 30th
19:57
2021 um God's ways God's ways and I remind so
20:03
so so so so so we often want like a blessing each year or like a reward
20:10
each year a reward each month a reward each week but for me for four and a half
20:15
years it was like nothing in terms of like the external
20:20
rewards and blessings i should say you know um like nothing and then so many at
20:26
one time like so many so so much at one
20:31
time so God's ways are different god's ways
20:37
are different so um yeah I mean all that to say is that
20:44
the the key is just surrendering your finances to God surrendering everything to God and
20:52
not doing the societal norm thing when it comes to
20:59
finances you know like like uh buying things like spending
21:06
money on yourself um because we we tend to feel like we're
21:13
entitled to things we're entitled to get ourselves things you know um but with God it's it's
21:21
different it's different so be sensitive to his leading because
21:30
the rewards are tied to your obedience the rewards of God are the best the
21:35
rewards of God the rewards from God are so much greater than um so much greater
21:42
than like you rewarding yourself you know they're so much greater
21:48
so much greater so it's worth the wait and it's worth the sacrifice
21:54
what you sew you reap so there's a time of sewing and there's a time of reaping
22:00
and I know even that's like true for my life like when my heart is hungering for certain
22:06
rewards from God's that he has promised I have to remember it's not yet the
22:12
reaping time yet it's the sewing time i need to keep focusing on sewing and not
22:17
despise the sewing time but know that this is leading to the reaping time
How to balance showing love, compassion and mercy with discipline for your child?
22:25
how to balance showing love compassion and mercy with discipline for your child
22:31
well when you need to discipline them um
22:36
be firm and authoritative but make sure it's Christlike you know
22:41
not not allowing anger to come through
22:47
to be a part of that discipline but just
22:52
that firmness and authoritiveness but
22:58
but with love and gentle fulness and peace
23:03
and um you know communicating and explaining why this disciplining is
23:09
happening that it's all because you love them because
23:15
if a child is doing things that are wrong
23:21
the things that they are doing that are wrong are ultimately going to hurt them are ultimately going to open up doors to
23:27
the enemy are ultimately going to hurt other people so this is why you were saying what
23:35
you're saying and doing what you're doing to really communicate that
23:40
so that the child understands why I remember like I remember when my eyes
23:48
open up to how like we how like why we shouldn't
23:54
do certain things that we want to do as teenagers like when I was a teenager I lived lukewarm for a time
24:03
but I h my my spiritual eyes were so shut at that time i knew God loved me
24:10
but I did not understand the word i didn't understand why God said to not do
24:16
things like to me it was just like these are laws you just have to follow them
24:21
you know but now I have this revelation that wow God instructed us to not do
24:28
these things to not do certain things because when we do these things we open up a door to the enemy and we can have
24:34
demons and our life could be we could walk into destruction and be tormented
24:40
so this is why God tells us to do these things and I just remember thinking like
24:47
if I had had this knowledge as a teenager oh my goodness
24:54
I I I I would not have stepped into the world in any area i I feel like when I
25:01
could you know just see like this is God's love i don't want to this is dangerous to do this but I remember
25:08
these things that you want to do as a teen that many people want to do as a teen it doesn't seem like there's any
25:13
danger to it you don't understand why you're not supposed to do it you don't understand it's just like these rules like don't do
25:19
these things this is how you see like I don't understand so um yeah so like
25:27
it's for for children to have that communication for parents to be as a parent to communicate like with love um
25:35
this is why I love you i care about you um you know even even I don't want you
25:42
to make the same mistakes I did you know um
25:48
so that the so that so that the child is not seeing you as just like
25:56
being mean for no reason disciplining them for no reason making up rules for
26:02
no reason um which leads like to rebellion you know but to really like
26:07
communicate with them when when they're ready to hear you know maybe at a time when they're able to listen more
26:16
um just like talk to them with so much love
26:23
even though they're not planted yes yes and when you you you have so much power
26:30
so much power over your children you have so much power like if people if if
26:38
if if parents can have power to bring generational curses by their actions by
26:45
opening up doors to the enemy by making covenants then how much more powerful
26:52
is a parent who confesses the word of God over their child makes covenants with God about
27:00
their child that says "Me and my house will serve the Lord." How much more
27:06
powerful is that confession is that covenant with God it's so
27:11
powerful and it's it's really supernatural what takes place when you
27:18
speak these things when you confess these things when you make these covenants with God over your whole family over your children
27:25
there's a great grace that comes upon your family where God you you you you're
27:31
letting God work you're releasing his power his anointing you're giving him
27:37
permission to have his way with your family so there is so much power in
27:42
renouncing there's so much power in confessing there's so much power in making covenants with God over your
27:48
family that your family belongs to God your children belong to God
27:55
um you know did anyone watch
28:01
April's testimony yesterday she said that the demons were trying to
28:06
get her to renounce being bapti being baptized as a baby
28:12
i mean baptism should be a decision we make on our own but even if it's called
28:18
baptism as a baby like I was baptized as a baby in a Presbyterian church that's what they do they don't call them dedications they call them baptisms but
28:26
in the spiritual realm it was the action of my parents dedicating me to God
28:35
that was the action in the spiritual realm so April's dad dedicated her to or
28:41
her parents or who whoever dedicated her to God and the the demons were trying to
28:47
get her to renounce that so that shows that there's so much power in the parents dedicating their children
28:54
to the Lord making covenants with God for them to belong to God and serve to serve God there's so much power in that
29:03
so yes and believe that God is working believe that God is working
29:11
hallelujah does this renouncing for your kid apply
Does renouncing for your kid apply to an adopted child?
29:17
also to an adopted child i'm finding so much resistance here yes because in the spiritual realm they are your child they
29:25
are your child in the spiritual realm you they are your under your authority
29:32
in the spiritual realm so this applies just as much
29:39
so keep believing and keep keep confessing keep renouncing keep speaking
29:48
God's word over them what to share with somebody that I sent
What to do when your family members don’t believe in Jesus and revival?
29:53
videos from 5F but I didn't explain that they should take the teaching seriously
29:59
well um wait for the right timing when you're talking about
30:05
5F when you're talking about Jesus if that's happening if you're if you're able to talk with them and you can share
30:12
part of your testimony you can share you know rather than being like um hey I see
30:17
you're not doing this you need to do this you know you with wisdom you can share a different way you can share your
30:23
testimony you can share and I don't know if this is your testimony but if this is your testimony
30:29
you could share something like this before I wasn't applying the teachings i wasn't taking it very seriously but then
30:34
I started taking it seriously and whoa the difference in my life the transformation this is everything for
30:40
you to be a you have to be a real disciple not just a listener you have to be a doer of the word
30:48
you know that changed everything in my life when I started doing that
30:57
renounce on behalf of her sister who is so oppressed and super scared of you and wants nothing to do with you oh
Can my mom renounce on behalf of her sister?
31:04
yeah for your for your family
31:09
and for for your family there is there is power in calling them into the
31:16
kingdom there is power in praying for them so I remember in sewing seeds for
31:21
them because your seeds carry power sometimes it's important to to when when
31:26
you're find when you're really needing breakthrough in air in an area make a sacrifice to God not because you have to
31:35
but because you value God's power you val It's a way to show him that you
31:41
value his miracles because whenever we give to God whenever we make sacrifice to God it
31:49
contributes to his kingdom advancing and so that's why giving to God is so
31:54
important because it's it's it literally contributes to God's kingdom advancing
32:00
and it's it's a sacrifice we make for him so I years ago swed seeds for my
32:08
niece and my nephews to know Jesus years ago I swed these seeds i I sent a
32:17
seed to my spiritual father and with this prayer request um and I called them into the kingdom of
32:26
God and I am literally in awe with
32:33
how God has moved upon my prayers my seed for them
32:39
because I never saw any interest in God that I never saw them to have any interest in
32:45
God they're 16 and um
32:52
about to be 14 yeah 16 and about to be 14 and never saw
32:58
them to have any interest in God and um whenever I would I didn't see them for
33:04
like how many years was it from 20
33:10
from 2020 2021 to 2025
33:19
five 24 three years three and a half years I didn't see them for three and a half years but whenever I would see them
33:28
um there was never any talk about God and um yeah so then All of a sudden
33:38
my I I I I they I asked them if they wanted 5F shirts and they did they
33:44
really liked them and I was like "That's cool." Cuz it says things about Jesus and they the back says "Jesus can free
33:50
you really big and they wanted them and they were wearing them to like basketball games and I was like "Wow
33:57
Lord are you are you doing something like okay praise God." And my my younger
34:02
nephew asked my mom for other like God saying shirts like some different
34:09
sayings of God and um for Christmas and my mom and I were talking like wow this
34:15
is amazing and then um
34:21
and then all of a sudden my nephew who we never really we never
34:27
really text you know but he texted me the day Actually it was in the middle of
34:36
persecution big spiritual attack I hadn't faced in years and not this was something a new
34:44
kind of evil new level new devil and it was the day I was about to I was going to
34:50
have a TV interview for Unlock Your Deliverance in March and um and I woke
34:58
up well actually he texted me the day before and he was like "What religion are you?" And I was like "What?" And I
35:06
said "Christian." And he texted me the day of the interview and he said "That's what I thought." Well I think I want to
35:13
be one too but I'm not sure how um and I and you're like the expert so I
35:20
thought I'd ask you and it was the most one of the most joyous moments of my life the joy I
35:27
experienced getting that text message and I got that text message like as I
35:33
was on the way to the TV interview that was the TV interview in Florida with Jen
35:38
Malin um and uh what was in what was so
35:44
wild was that his sister and mother which is my niece and sister happened to
35:50
be in the same exact city as me in Florida when they live in upstate New
35:55
York and my mom saw my niece's story that she was in the same city as me
36:04
and so then I got to have dinner with the two of them that same day and I
36:11
talked about God like I never had been able to that I like I never had in the past with them
36:17
and my sister even brought up how both of the nephews are asking her about God
36:23
and she's like she said "Well we don't do the best but um you should ask you
36:28
should ask Aunt Catherine." Um she brought that up
36:36
and that can only be God because they're 16 and 13
36:43
and I mean those ages for this to be happening
36:49
so um then I had a call i had a FaceTime call with my nephew like two a couple
36:55
days later i and I told him my whole testimony in depth and I told him all about God and I just gave him the basics
37:03
of following Jesus and um it was so beautiful was so precious that call with
37:10
him and um and I sent him Bibles and just
37:17
that was in March and just yesterday there's a little book that says God's promises for your every need and it's a
37:24
book that was like $3 that I found in like Hobby Lobby or something like 10 years ago that I gave my niece for
37:30
Christmas and it it just simply is like when you have anxiety here's verses
37:36
about Um here's verses to go to if you feel fear it's just like a a book like
37:42
that it's not really like a devotional it's just it's you know it's just you know that's what it is and he texted me
37:50
a couple days ago and he said with a with that picture of that and he says "Sopia my niece um you gave her this
37:58
book and I really like it could you send me one?" And he asked me you know yesterday what
38:05
he started with John and I told him to start with John in the Bible and he said he finished and which one which chapter
38:10
should he read next um I just say all that to say is that like
38:17
I can't tell you how supernatural this is i cannot tell you how
38:24
in awe I am um and I I just am just so in awe of
38:30
like the power of our prayers and the power of um sewing for our family
38:38
members i I swed a seed for for my for him and
38:43
my other nephew same thing like I started texting him and he is I can see the hunger he has
38:51
for God all of a sudden praise God i sent him verses to encourage him and he was so grateful this is the almost
38:59
14-year-old one um and he's 13 now
39:05
um and like I swed seeds for them like and
39:11
prayed for them called them into the kingdom years ago it would have been probably
39:18
2017ish 2018ish if I had to guess I don't know but I
39:26
remember asking my spiritual father about my family about my family members and he had shared that prophetic
39:35
insight and instruction and I followed it and now I'm seeing I'm seeing God
39:41
move supernaturally praise God
39:50
so that was in response oops here's a filter again so that was in response to
39:55
the question that I just saw about like a sister okay so there's the mom's
40:00
sister is resistant to God so there's power in your prayers there's
40:07
power in sewing there is power um for me it it didn't happen immediately but it
40:13
was in God's perfect timing it was in the year of acceptance that I started seeing the fruits the reaping of my
40:20
sewing
40:25
read my chapter on sewing in unlock your deliverance book because I explain in depth the power of sewing how it is a
40:33
new wine spiritual principle that many people do not understand in the old wine
40:39
they see giving as not powerful at all but there is so much power in your seed
40:46
that is biblical and that is seen all over the word of God so it is a matter
40:52
of it being a spiritual principle it is a matter of it being part of our surrender to God it is a matter of it
40:57
being a sacrifice that moves God's heart that um because your action
41:06
faith without works is dead faith without works is dead and there is power
41:12
in action there is there is so much power in action not just word service
41:17
but action so much there is so much power in the actions we do for God's kingdom for serving and sewing for the
41:25
contributing to God's work the as I've shared I've shared this recently i know
41:33
I share this a lot at Arise and Shine but I'm truly blown away by the the abundant
41:40
life I walk in by the continual peace and joy I have for the the
41:48
how distant the devil feels from my life praise God i mean there's persecution
41:54
that happens but I mean like I I I I'm not like
42:00
having these constant demonic dreams i'm never getting like the devil's voice in
42:05
my mind um a a lot of that comes with with maturing spiritually of course and
42:12
renewing your mind of course but like the protection I I I I I sense in my own
42:20
personal life and the constant abundant life the constant peace and joy I found in my life has not come any old way but
42:29
it has come by giving my life to the work of God it is I serve God
42:37
continually i sow so much to God's kingdom i sow so much
42:45
i'm every day contributing so much with serving and sewing
42:54
and that's that's where the grace is that's where the power is
42:59
because the work of God is God's heart
43:07
the work of God is how souls are saved is how people are healed and people are delivered so when we can
43:16
be about the father's business so much and serving it and sewing
43:23
this is where you access the supernatural favor of God you get the
43:29
cloak that Joseph had in the spiritual realm that favor of God
43:38
because of what you're doing because of how you're touching God's heart we cannot only touch God's heart with our
43:45
words we have to touch God's heart in action
43:52
hallelujah praise God and so like serving and
43:59
sewing are like one one together because they are about contributing to God's
44:04
work i saw a question earlier that was wondering is it can serving count as
44:10
sewing sometimes like they're they're so connected they're two in one but at the
44:16
same time God wants us to do both you you know he wants us to do both especially because there's a need in in
44:23
both area you know and that for me it's been like equally both equally both
44:31
always but maybe there's times in life where you where you
44:37
it's different like like I um I've shared some for for some people
44:44
like who are planted online for example maybe you don't know how to serve a big way you can serve is by sharing
44:50
testimonies by sharing what God is doing sharing the videos sharing the posts um sharing the book unlock your deliverance
44:56
like doing this work of God it's making people's IE
45:02
someone just commented yesterday April's video of her deliverance is what led me
45:07
to five of Church and be planted and where I'm now receiving so much so because somebody shared the video now
45:14
somebody's come into the kingdom so oh it's no small thing to be sharing the
45:20
videos and the posts of the work of God it's no small thing it's it's massive
45:26
serving that you're doing but also like that doesn't take tons of time to do
45:32
maybe you want to be serving more maybe you want like but you don't live in LA you can't be on the worship team or
45:38
operate the cameras or be an usher or something like that in LA you know well another area of service of contributing
45:44
to God's work is sewing so it'll look different for people like maybe someone has has more finances and they can serve
45:52
God in that area more so they're sewing more serving less because they don't
45:58
that's not the they don't have the opportunity maybe to to spend as much time serving as people who live in LA
46:04
for example or someone who's editing videos has that opportunity you know and then the opposite is true too like if
46:10
you're in a season where you don't have much financially you don't need to feel like "Oh no I'm missing out i'm not ever
46:16
going to prosper because I'm not able to sew much." No you as you serve God is
46:22
counting that as you're contributing to God's work as as sewing but
46:28
you I mean that's for a season though like that's not an excuse to be lazy and like not get a job or that's not an
46:36
excuse to be lazy and um only get like a a job that doesn't pay
46:43
much when you could be getting a job that pays more for example um to live the abundant life that God wants you to
46:49
live for his glory and for his kingdom so you can be a blessing to bless others to bless his kingdom amen
Does sowing need to be specific all the time?
46:58
does so we need to be specific all the time or God or does God see our heart and knows the areas we need it most of
47:04
the time I just sew just in the heart of giving things and contribution to God's work yes that's that's absolutely fine
47:10
that's absolutely fine to do but then when there's a certain need or something that God is leading you to sew for specific purpose then that is a time
47:17
where you you know you speak that aloud you you you declare that over that seed
47:22
you give that prayer to God prayer across with God to God with that seed but it's it doesn't have to be like
47:29
religious that you are sometimes you can just give you know
47:35
to contribute to God's work and to give thanks to God god blessed me with a job after I
Someone helped me to get a job. How do I know if it's God will.
47:40
planted myself at 5F last year somebody from nowhere helped me to get this job
47:47
how do I know if that is God's will praise God well if you
47:54
need a job and this job door opened and
48:01
you know there's nothing like sinful related to this job then that's that's
48:07
that's amazing praise God as I've taught several times in the past how
48:13
before God speaks something definitive in your life that you're supposed to do this which it doesn't always happen that
48:19
way sometimes it's just the Holy Spirit leading you maybe the Holy Spirit um gives you a gift and passion and you
48:27
that's that's where he wants you to be i mean uh I had this um desire I had this
48:36
passion for for musical theater for acting for singing and so I was um
48:42
pursuing that and for some people they may feel that and that may be where God
48:50
wants them to be that may be where God wants them to shine their lights um and
48:55
God will end up using other weak weak things in them and and and and use use
49:01
them mightily through their weaknesses in different areas so it's not that everyone is like has the same calling as
49:07
me where they follow their passions and then God has a completely different plan
49:12
it's not like that for everybody for a lot of people it will be um God has a plan to use you in that job where you
49:20
have a gifting um or maybe like you you you know you have a great gifting in
49:25
something and because of that it makes you to excel it makes you to doors to
49:31
open up for you to have abundance of provision and that's how God blesses you and God wants to use you as a light in
49:39
that um career in that um
49:44
in that area of society you know it's
49:50
not everyone that is called to be a five-fold minister for a lot of five-fold ministers like me it'll look a
49:56
lot like my story for a lot of them where they are following their passions but then God has a completely different
50:02
plan but for others who aren't it's it's it's some who are called to five-fold ministry not all the Bible says some so
50:07
for many people that aren't called to be fivefold ministers most of the time it's going to look like you know God put your
50:14
gifts and passions in you to to elevate
50:19
you you know for like as you use that gifting it opens up doors god opens up
50:25
doors and you shine because God built you that way and as you serve him and
50:31
the anointing comes upon that gift you you re you you really shine for his
50:37
glory you don't just you you don't shine in a worldly way or like how anybody can
50:42
shine with a gift but you shine with the anointing of God um and you change
50:48
people's lives and people are drawn to Jesus through you instead of just drawn to your gift and blessed by your gift
50:53
but they're drawn to Jesus in you anyways so all that to be said um when
50:59
it comes to looking for jobs you know it's it's it's it's a choice
51:04
God wants you to make while inviting him in but a lot of the times when it comes to looking for jobs it's not like um God
51:11
has a certain specific job you must have season to season it it many times it's
51:17
you using wisdom you were made in the image of God to use your mind and use
51:22
wisdom um to choose jobs so all that to say um
51:27
sometimes people over complicate like jobs is this God is this not when um you
51:34
just need to use wisdom thank you Lord i declare for every person here who wrote in comments prayer requests who has uh
51:42
sickness of pain in their body i speak healing to you now healing all over your
51:48
body in Jesus name for anybody struggling with sleep may you sleep well in Jesus name for every demonic spirit I
51:54

52:01
of your life now in Jesus name and I declare now
52:08
that this anointing would touch you and fill you more with God's love and his
52:14
power and his fire and his boldness in Jesus' name may wisdom increase in you
52:20
may your spiritual eyes open up more to see and understand the kingdom of God
52:26
may a humble heart come in you more to just receive like a child to just receive receive like a child without
52:34
questioning or having to have everything figured out may this childlike heart
52:40

53:10
Spirit guiding you and leading you every day in in how to steward what he's
53:17
given you and how to steward your finances in in how to serve him the best in
53:25
Jesus' name thank you Jesus and I speak on this special day the special day this
53:32

54:28

54:41
thank you Jesus thank you Lord thank you Father i release this anointing upon you
54:48
