How to always stay humble?
0:01
How to always stay humble. Um, well,
0:06
when God blesses you, when God gives you things you didn't once have, he blesses
0:12
you, it's so important to understand that you're not entitled. and to to to see how precious these gifts
0:19
are, to really value what God has blessed you with, and to to not see
0:25
anything in your life as being entitled to or that you deserve, but seeing
0:33
all of the blessings, all the blessings that you have as truly gifts from God.
0:38
That is an important way of how to stay humble because God takes us from glory to glory. God brings us abundant life
0:44
and more abundant life and more abundant life. He blesses us more and more and more as we stay in his will. So it's
0:51
very important to renew your mind that just because more and more blessings are
0:57
coming, it doesn't mean that we should be entitled to them. And some of these blessings, they are a reward. It is a
1:03
reward of serving God. So you see them as gifts from God. Yes. But you should
1:08
still see them in a way that you're not entitled to them so that you can really value them
1:15
and and not have that feeling of entitlement.
1:22
Another big way to stay humble is honestly like the message that I shared this past week um of practicing
1:30
gratitude and making that priority because as you practice gratitude it's like you're taking inventory on the
1:37
blessings that God has given you and you are really valuing them not taking them
1:42
for granted and not living in a way that you're entitled to these blessings. Um
1:49
that is such an important way of staying humbled as well is to live a life of
1:54
gratitude, intentional gratitude. So this past Wednesday I taught in depth
2:01
on this powerful key of of having joy is to practice
2:09
gratitude. Is it okay to share 5F with my patients when they express their faith to me?
2:15
Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, you know, we especially, you know, this can
2:21
depend how to walk in wisdom in this area of how you share your faith in the workplace. That depends on your where you live, the rules, the laws where you
2:28
live, the culture where you live. Depends on how you walk in wisdom
2:33
in sharing the good news. Um, but like in America it's freedom of religion,
2:39
freedom of speech, and to just
2:44
in a way that's not being forceful, but in a way of just sharing your story and
2:50
sharing hope. You should you you should feel free and
2:55
not like you're doing something dangerous to share your faith in the workplace.
3:01
So it's just about walking in wisdom you know like if you were to be forceful and
3:11
you know in sharing your faith you know trying to force someone's force your faith on somebody by how you you speak
3:19
you know that the workplace it could cause problems in for for that person in
3:25
the workplace. But if you are just sharing with wisdom, sharing just your
3:31
story, sharing hope, there should be nothing wrong with that. There there should you will have
3:38
protection from God because you walk in that wisdom.
How can we use AI wisely?
3:43
How can we use AI wisely? Well, that is a big question because there's so many different aspects of AI that even I mean
3:51
and and is it's like I don't you know there's so much to learn still about what even is AI and all the different
3:58
aspects of AI. There's so many different aspects. So like you know there's one aspect of AI
4:04
where like we've done I've you know like like a
4:11
preaching video you know and you you you you you show like
4:16
um an angel army type thing or an example of like David and Goliath and a
4:22
visual of them and that is really powerful to visually
4:28
um share the message you know so that's a really awesome way that you could use
4:33
it you know um it could be used now you know even like Google Google is similar
4:40
to AI in this aspect I don't know really it's I mean well Google I guess is using
4:46
AI itself but if you like Google slash AI or chatgbt like versus script Bible
4:53
verses on um on uh uh uh being humble or
5:00
something or whatever or a certain topic and then it shares a list. Like that's that's a great tool. It's a great way to
5:08
find certain scriptures of a certain topic, but you do not want to have AI
5:14
like teaching you. You do not want to be getting revelation from AI. So it's it's that the balance
5:23
of using it as a tool but not as a teacher not as how you are getting revelation
5:30
from God. Um yeah
5:35
that's all I can say for now because I don't even know all the different complexities of AI yet.
5:42
Um, but from what I have seen so far, it's just a balance. Really, a balance and walking in wisdom.
5:49
In regards to finding freedom from vaping yet, it's so important to not be waiting for a moment where, oh, I don't
How to find freedom from vaping?
5:56
have the temptation anymore. But it's it's so important to know to believe that you're free and now you have the
6:03
power with the Holy Spirit helping you to reject the temptation to vape, to do
6:10
anything. So when it comes to addiction, when you were planning where God's power is and you are renouncing it and you are
6:16
applying all the keys, you are free. You you are free now. You need to believe
6:21
those words declared whether it was on alive and I for example spoke addiction
6:26
must go. You have to believe that that has taken place in your life. You have to believe that God's power is in you.
6:33
The Holy Spirit's in you helping you now resist every temptation. And now it is truly a matter of needing to crucify
6:40
your flesh, needing to deny your flesh. Now that's not going to be comfortable. Some being free from an addiction isn't
6:46
always comfortable. It's not all for some people it is. For some people it's like the addiction, the feeling, the temptation, the urge to do the drug, for
6:54
example, it just left them. And so experiencing freedom, it was
7:01
comfortable. It was easy. But that's not how it will be for everybody. For others,
7:07
they are free. There's no longer a chain of addiction. There is no longer a force controlling you.
7:14
But now you have to do your part to deny the flesh, to crucify the flesh, and to be so serious about rejecting that
7:22
temptation, rejecting the devil's lies, and renew your mind that you have the strength and power to stop uh vaping, to
7:30
stop doing this drug. You, the Holy Spirit's in you. You have to confess that. You have to confess, I can do this
7:38
with God's strength. I am free. This is not like before where there was a force of addiction, a spiritual demonic force
7:45
that controlled me. Now, with God's help, I always can reject this
7:52
temptation. I can overcome this temptation in Jesus' name. If you are
7:57
truly planted where God's power is, where really this powerful anointing is, and you're truly applying the keys, and
8:03
you're truly surrendered to God, doing your best, there's no way that you can't
8:08
be free. If if you've been here for for a time, for a while, there's no way. So
8:16
now you you need to know it's a matter of faith and walking out that faith. Faith without works is dead. Walk out
8:22
that faith and continually reject the devil's lies. continually
8:27
um confess the truth and that's how the devil loses his grip. And then step by
8:33
step by step, step by step by step of you walking out that faith, that temptation will leave you. You will
8:40
not feel such a strong temptation. Can the light of Jesus shine differently
Can the light of Jesus shine differently through each person?
8:45
through everyone? Can you shine even when you don't feel like you are? Yes, the light of Jesus shines differently
8:51
through everyone. um he's given us all different giftings and different um ways
8:56
that he will shine through. So sometimes you actually shine through your gifting. Sometimes you're shining through your
9:02
work, through what you're doing for God, you are shining. And so like let's say
9:08
you do a work for God and then that work is seen by others.
9:14
That's you shining through that work. That's you. It's not just like the smile
9:19
on your face or the tone of your voice, the tone of kindness in your voice that
9:27
shines the light of Jesus to the world. Um,
9:32
you are shining by what you are doing for God as well
9:38
by the work of God that you are doing. You are making God to be glorified. You
9:43
are making his light to be revealed. And so it's Jesus through you that's doing
9:50
these things. So that's that's you shining. It's you shining. It's and and so maybe
9:57
it's not seen by everyone that that you are shining
10:02
because maybe you're doing like behind the scenes work but you are shining and heaven sees and
10:09
God sees and people are drawn to the light because you are shining.
10:15
So you know we shine so that people are led to Jesus not to us. So that does so
10:21
that so that means it doesn't matter if you know we get the credit or not you
10:26
know so that that means it doesn't matter if it's whether it's a person praying for somebody and revealing the
10:32
love of God through the words they speak or if it's someone behind the scenes doing the work of God. In both cases the
10:40
light is being shined through people and people are being led to Jesus.
10:48
You know, some some people are called to be preaching, to be ministering, to be in front of people all the time. And so,
10:54
people are looking at their faces all the time, and they're seeing the light of Jesus in their faces. But other
10:59
people are called to be behind the scenes. Other people have different callings, but they are shining just the
11:05
same. They are leading people to Jesus just the same.
11:12
Yeah. So when we are the light of the world, it doesn't mean about getting recognition about it's
11:19
about leading people to Jesus the light.
I started a business, how can I be confident that it's' the Holy Spirit and not just me giving up?
11:25
I started a business last year and now feel like Holy Spirit wants me to put it on hold. How can I be confident? It's the Holy Spirit and not me giving up. So
11:33
when it comes to businesses, jobs, it's going to be the decisions you make is
11:38
going to be by the wisdom of the Holy Spirit. It generally is coming from wisdom.
11:44
So generally like many mostly most of the time it won't be coming from this this serious direction from God like
11:53
audible voice or this is the way but often times it's coming from wisdom
12:01
wisdom that you receive from God that you receive from the Holy Spirit that you receive so much through teachings
12:07
that you receive um through the word of God. So I've taught a lot about this in the past about choosing jobs. So it's
12:14
similar like when you are choosing jobs many times it's most times it's not like
12:20
this is the job you must have this exact job is the job that God wants you to
12:26
have in most cases that's not how it is in our day-to-day life. I mean
12:31
what I mean is like when we're talking about um our journey now there are some
12:37
professions where God wants like that's where you will fulfill your calling. You're called
12:43
to reach people there and God reveals that as time goes on. But for other people, maybe they don't have this
12:49
clarity of like what their exact calling is. Like for me, I was in that place for
12:55
many years. I was trying out different things. I, you know, I and I was trying to find my calling. I thought I found my
13:01
calling, but I didn't actually. I thought I found my calling in music, but I didn't actually. But I tried many
13:06
different things. I tried hostessing. I tried um well I was pursuing acting and
13:13
then I was tried uh uh being a waitress and nanning and um pursuing acting all
13:20
the while and wedding planner. I tried that. Um then I was pursuing music. But
13:27
through all of that it wasn't like I couldn't hear God. I just was lost and
13:32
couldn't hear God. But at the same time it wasn't like God was speaking something crystal clear. He he he was
13:39
not speaking okay like very clearly like you must have this job here, you must have this
13:45
hostess job here, this waitress job here, this nanny job here. But he used me in all those different spaces. So
13:54
there there and it's different and I've shared this in the past but just to recap um for some people for fifold
14:01
ministries there will be a very serious um word that is confirmed through a
14:07
prophet or at times an apostle with prophetic anointing
14:13
um where it is either prophesied or confirmed and and anoint and and and you are
14:20
commissioned and anointed Um
14:25
but then for other things like God may really your your calling may be to be
14:30
like um a teacher in a school or a lawyer or a doctor or an actress like
14:37
that could be like like God gave you those gifts so that you could shine in that career space that area that field
14:46
of the world. Um, so you could shine in your gifting and rise like so you could
14:52
be like your gift would really shine there because God gave you that gift
14:57
from birth for this purpose for you to shine his light in that area of society
15:02
of the world. Um so so sometimes but but even that when
15:10
it's that usually usually it would wouldn't be not always but usually it
15:16
wouldn't be like this prophecy like you are called to be a doctor, a lawyer, a
15:23
teacher, an actress. But usually it is the wisdom of the Holy Spirit guiding you where your giftings are, where you
15:31
know where you are passionate so that God can really anoint those
15:38
giftings and lift you for his glory and have you shine in that area. Um,
15:45
so whether whether your path is to be a five-fold minister or whether your path
15:52
is to be in a different career space that God is giving you these giftings to flourish there to shine there. But the
15:59
Holy Spirit leads you in that through wisdom rather this than this definite word. In
16:07
both scenarios, you will generally for the most part people will have a before
16:14
before a prior time a time before of
16:20
having jobs that it's just about you walking in wisdom.
16:25
But it's not that God needs you to work here, needs you to start this business here, but it's God created you in his
16:32
image to make decisions yourself. godly decisions with wi his wisdom.
16:41
So um yeah, so all that being said to go back to the question, do I put this
16:46
business on hold? Do I not? You need to how to walk in wisdom in
16:52
this area is to see the priorities. The priorities is to serve God. The priorities is to put God first. That has
16:58
to be priority. Priority is to be a disciple. So, so being a disciple means
17:04
to to to have time to read his word, hear his teaching, serve at the church
17:11
you're planted at, if that's possible. Um, well, it's possible for everyone, but I mean like for some people they're
17:17
they have certain tasks they are doing for the work of God. Others don't have specific tasks, but they are called to
17:23
evangelize. They are called to spread the good news through social media, etc. So, serve and sewing, contributing to
17:29
the work of God. Um, so that's your priority. And so if there if there's a
17:36
conflict to that to any of that through like a business or anything then the
17:42
wisdom would be to put it on hold or do it go a different direction if there is
17:47
a conflict to that or if there if there's a greater opportunity that will
17:53
help you to to to to to put God first more to serve him more to contribute to
17:59
his kingdom more to if there's a greater opportunity then go there. But it's generally this
18:05
just wisdom that you're walking in rather than waiting for like a looking
18:11
for a sign of something specific or hearing an audible voice or a certain
18:16
prophecy. So, you really just have to walk in that
18:22
wisdom, you know, like when it comes to putting God first and contributing to his kingdom, you have to
18:27
walk in wisdom because some people can think like, okay, well, I think I'm just like someone can have like a good job
18:33
where they are paid well and um but it's
18:39
like a full-time job and so someone can like sometimes someone can get so excited about serving God um doing the
18:47
work of God. I mean, it lights them up. It fills them with with joy. They get they're so excited about it. Um,
18:54
and sometimes maybe they're like, "You know what? I think I'll just settle for um the bare minimum
19:03
like financial financial wise um because I
19:08
just want to spend all my time serving God." Um and so they like downgrade
19:16
so much um like for their life and uh but sometimes it can get to a point
19:23
where like one a person's like not even taking care of themsel and that's walking out of wisdom number one because
19:29
we need to take care of ourselves. Um you know
19:35
we need to not be a burden on others as well. we need to, you know, work so that
19:40
we can have enough finances to take care of ourselves. Um, and also
19:47
to bless others if they're in need. If if if God wants us to God wants us to be a blesser, not not, you know, to to be
19:54
able to bless others, not to always like take, you know, and also he wants all of his people to be able to contribute to
20:00
the work of God, to to bring their seed, to contribute to the work of God so there's not lack. So, um,
20:08
you and there could be somebody who has a great job that pays well, but they're like, I I just I'm going to leave this
20:16
job and just um get paid hardly anything so that I can spend my time serving God
20:22
because maybe they they're they're so passionate about serving God, but maybe God wanted to use them to help support
20:28
the work of God. And that is where there is such a big need is um finances for
20:37
the work of God. So and and maybe there's there's so much
20:42
so many other people that are that are doing the other the other things needed for the the work of God to go forth. So,
20:49
you have to walk in that wisdom and make sure it's not like um
20:56
honestly like a selfish motivation with with with work when it comes to work.
21:01
But you have to like walk in that wisdom like God, how do you want to like how do
21:07
you want to use me um with my gifts, with my abilities, with the opportunities you've given me, with with
21:12
with the seed, you know, you think about with with the the seeds that you have given me to sew. You think about um
21:21
the woman um at in Jesus's ministry that supported him. There's a scripture that says Joanna and other women, they were
21:30
they were contributing to they were funding Jesus's ministry. They were contributing financially to his
21:37
ministry. So they were playing their part. Like that was their part to play and their part wasn't the same as the
21:43
other disciples. um you know the other disciples were were assisting Jesus in
21:49
other things they weren't assisting financially you know they had left their jobs to be
21:56
trained by Jesus you know they didn't they wouldn't have been having an income actually these you know the women were
22:04
actually helping to provide for the disciples as well Jesus and his disciples
22:09
so like there's some people that are that that God's counting on them like
22:16
how he was counting on Joanna and the women to contribute to the kingdom of God in that way financially.
22:23
So that's the wisdom I will share when it comes to jobs. Um,
22:29
just seeing where the need is and seeing the gifts God's given you, the doors
22:36
he's opened and connecting the dots like seeing, wow, like God has God has opened
22:44
up these opportunities for me, o opened these doors, given me that opportunities.
22:50
Like a lot of people don't have these opportunities. A lot of people don't have these doors opened. A lot of people
22:55
aren't in this position, but I'm able to contribute to the kingdom of God in a way that many people can't because of
23:02
this grace that God's given me and the abilities and giftings that he's given me. So like don't overlook that, you
23:09
know, don't overlook what God has graced you with how he can
23:15
use it for his kingdom. It's not one sizefits-all in terms of serving God. We all have different roles to play and
23:21
they're all so important. So um yeah that's some more wisdom I'll share for
23:27
that topic. I'm answering now a question about impartation. Elisha received from Elijah.
Where do we receive impartation?
23:33
Paul received from Timothy or Timothy received from Paul. I'm sorry. Timothy received from Paul. Paul says you have many teachers but only many teachers but
23:40
only one spiritual father. Your spiritual father or mother is where you receive impartation from. So um he spoke
23:47
that clearly. Apostle Paul. Um, we see Joshua receiving impartation from Moses.
23:55
We only see uh every example we have of people
24:01
receiving impartation, we only see them receiving from their spiritual leader. We never see them receiving from
24:09
impartation from others. This is the principle of receiving impartation. This is the secret, one of the secrets. When
24:14
I say secret, I mean principle that many people miss that you have to have spiritual eyes to really grasp and understand, especially because it's it's
24:22
one of those like lost revelations in in the church today. So when I say secrets,
24:28
I mean principles of God that are biblical, but you you you have to have
24:34
spiritual eyes to see and grasp and understand, and you have to have a humble, pure heart to have spiritual eyes opened. So
24:42
um yeah, that's just how impartation works. It it's how it's it's like God
24:48
God is very strict to his order. Um he's very strict and he stays true to his
24:55
word. So we have to understand the seriousness, the importance of abiding
25:04
by his commands, by his principles and not take it casually.
25:11
Yeah.
25:16
To try to receive from some elsewhere, it weakens the connection. It weakens what you have received
25:24
and it lessens like the trustworthiness um is how God sees.
25:31
um in spreading this revival. A pastor may invite me to minister at their church, but they may not know about the
25:38
new wine, but they may be very open. Um and they and God may lead me to minister
25:44
at that church to reach their people to set the captives free there. Um but that
25:52
pastor may have no clue about new wine principles. Um, and sometimes it could
25:58
just be like sometimes there can be wrong motives too, you know. Um, but God
26:03
may still want me to minister to the people because the people are bound and he wants them to be set free. So, um,
26:12
you know, there can be sometimes a there could be a situation where a pastor would try to um prophesy to me like out
26:21
of order but not realize it's out of order. or maybe they do partially but maybe there's wrong motives there for
26:26
example but it's what m what matters is in my heart if that I do not accept
26:32
these things these words these prophecies the impartation that it's trying to be released or something if
26:38
you know if that's out of order in my heart I do not receive that at all but it's important to walk in wisdom because
26:45
some people they just don't understand and so uh you know you can just have
26:50
that grace for them and um be peaceful and um you know not
26:57
you know verbally rejecting their face and and things like that. It's a matter of walking in wisdom and God sees the
27:04
heart. So God sees your heart when you don't accept something that someone's trying to prophesy to you for example
27:10
like out of order. He sees your heart. So that's all that you need to um be
27:15
concerned about. How do I navigate wanting to apologize
How to navigate apologizing to someone from my past without getting close?
27:21
to someone from my past that I was close with, but not wanting to rekindle that friendship or romantic relationship
27:27
because they're still in the world.
27:33
So, um,
27:39
for the most part, I mean, it just you have to walk in wisdom and it depends on the situation. It really depends on the situation. And it's hard to give like a
27:46
broad answer to this question, but I mean for the most part if this, you
27:52
know, friendships, romantic relationshipships that you've had in the past before giving your life to Jesus,
28:00
these relationships that were worldly, these relationships, sometimes they may
28:05
have been abusive, sometimes maybe the person may have abused you or manipulated you. These relationships are
28:14
seasonal are seasonal and um
28:20
for the most part it is wise to just leave it in the past.
28:26
to just leave it in the past because many times
28:31
by engaging starting to text a person or speaking to a person can truly be
28:38
dangerous spiritually can open up the door for it can be giving access to the
28:43
enemy even if that wasn't your intention but it can really be seen as giving access to the enemy.
28:51
So because of this being spiritually dangerous to
28:57
start to talk to someone who is supposed to just stay in the past that relationship because of it being
29:02
spiritually dangerous. It's okay that there isn't this apology of what you know something you feel convicted about
29:10
from many years ago. Um, you know, if there's a situation where you happen to
29:15
see this person again, um, that could be a time you can share a very brief
29:21
apology, but you don't need to go look set out
29:26
for that to happen. Um, that would be the wisdom for most situations in that
29:32
regard because what I want to say above all things is that it's just so important to not open up the door to
29:38
relationships that were supposed to stay in the past. It's very important and to just start
29:44
like texting someone. It can be a big open door even if it's done just simply
29:52
and not with the intention of becoming close to a person.
30:06
So you know like
30:12
We also just have to accept accept that people will understand boundaries and
30:19
that's okay. Like we don't have people may feel hurt because of boundaries that are put up, but it's it's not that
30:27
you're doing something wrong that you need to apologize for it. And I know there can be that feeling.
30:34
Um, you know, but you you just have to understand the
30:40
seriousness of these wrong relationships staying in your life and understand this is obedience to God to have these
30:47
boundaries put up,
30:52
you know. Um, I know that there's I'm sure there's, you know, people from my past that would love to like be close to
30:59
me, but I can't like what I'm called to right now. have to is so precious. I have to protect it. Um, and I can't feel
31:06
like I have to owe something to someone in my past because I used to in that season hang out with them a lot and talk
31:14
to them a lot. I I can't feel like obliged that that carries over to this
31:20
season now. You know, I have to make sure I'm really obedient to what God is
31:26
calling me to in this season and who he's really calling me to keep close and
31:31
be in contact with. And I know even people from my past, I'm they probably really maybe they really
31:37
don't understand it, you know, like why those boundaries are important, but I can't bother myself with that. Um I have
31:45
to just rest knowing I'm in God's will.
What do the promises of God refer to?
31:50
When I say the word promise, what does that refer to? Promises of God. So
31:57
three things. Promises that are given to all of us that are in his word. That's
32:03
number one. That would be a promise of healing, freedom, peace, sound mind, joy, abundant life.
32:12
So sometimes a person's waiting on the promise of their healing to manifest. And so sometimes that is the promise
32:19
that's feels like a slaying that they're waiting on. Number two pro but but God will fulfill
32:26
that promise in his perfect timing. Amen. Number two, the second part of a kind of
32:33
a promise is specific promises God has given you through prophetic words. Like
32:41
for me there are prophetic words that my spiritual father has spoken over my life. These are promises. These are have
32:48
become dreams. God's dreams have become my dreams. Um promises he spoken over 5F over this
32:55
revival that I am waiting on and
33:01
continue to believe God for. So that's the second type of promise is
33:06
specific prophecies spoken over you that are promises from God.
33:13
The third kind of promise is desires of your heart. Delight in the Lord and he will give you the desires of
33:20
your heart. These are certain promises that you you've had a confirmation from the Holy
33:27
Spirit that it is his will though you have surrendered it. So for
33:33
many people that could be like marriage and children. Um maybe you surrender that to God, but
33:39
you you feel this conviction from the Holy Spirit that
33:45
this is his plan for your life. And so those desires of your heart that
33:51
are godly, that are from God, are also promises.
Wisdom in marriages
33:58
I would like to hear more about what is the responsibility as a wife to my husband when it comes to failures or bad behavior I see in his life. Shouldn't I
34:04
tell him in love what I see? Um,
34:10
this should just be done in such wisdom, especially in the specific role of wife and husband as wives submit to husbands.
34:17
That's just that's specifically in marriage. Um, not having to do with like
34:23
male and females in the church. By and large, this is talking about marriage, which is an earthly um earthly uh uh
34:32
thing uh relationship. So, there's a specific instruction from God that to to and it's part of his
34:38
order. It's part of just his leadership mandate, order that wives submit to husbands. So, um both husbands and wives
34:47
should walk in 100% humility. Um, but wives need to
34:57
go even further to be humble as a
35:03
responsibility, as a command. I mean, both should be in obedience to God, 100% humble. But what I mean is like if a
35:10
husband is not surrendered to God fully. Okay? So maybe
35:15
there's open doors and it's leading to bad behavior, you know. Well, as a wife,
35:22
you you need to to know your role and humble yourself
35:28
and know that also by not humbling yourself and having walking in submission, it's it's not
35:36
going to help the situation because the husband is seen as the leader. Um, so
35:44
even it won't be the husband won't even really be able to receive it very well because it's like
35:50
it's not making sense. It's not going along with order type thing. So the wife
35:55
should, that's why I say the wife should go even deeper with humility. just being
36:01
gentle, just knowing that going in in such a
36:07
area of gentleness and kindness and patience. And so, um,
36:14
there's wisdom in in it shouldn't be like a full out like correcting, but um,
36:21
just speaking with so much love and kindness and gentleness and waiting for the right time for it to come up in
36:26
conversation. And um even perhaps sharing testimony is a good way like to
36:33
for God to bring conviction through testimony rather than directly speaking like as a mentor I'm correcting you in
36:40
this area type attitude. You see but it's like really being servant-hearted.
36:48
Really being servant-hearted. um
36:53
like wanting to wanting to do the best you can to help the husband um receive
37:00
the correction rather than flatout correcting like wanting to do your part as a vessel of God for God to move upon
37:07
the heart and to to speak to him. So like for an example is is sharing
37:14
testimony like you know
37:20
maybe the maybe the person is struggling to receive new wine, they're struggling
37:26
with pride. Um and then maybe someday you just share
37:31
a testimony about how you used to struggle in a certain area. you struggled with pride, but then as you
37:36
humbled yourself, God really opened up your eyes and how you realized just how important this is and how we're really
37:43
missing out when we don't humble ourselves. We are really missing out on so much
37:49
that God has for us. That's just like a little example. Rather than being so direct and pinpointing like you're doing
37:56
this wrong, you need to change. Do you see your wrongs?
38:01
It's just that's just not the wisdom to where the person will really be able to receive it.
38:09
It's like it's like an above reproach like walking in this great wisdom
38:16
understanding all the different dynamics and coming with that intention of like I
38:22
just want to do the best I can as a vessel for God to use me
38:27
to to speak to his heart. Do all of your older teachings still
Do all your old teachings still apply or do they expire?
38:33
apply or do they expire due to God's timing and specific seasons? Yes, they all still apply. They they are
38:40
it's like the Bible. The Bible doesn't apply only to 2,000
38:46
plus years ago, more than that, thousands and thousands of years ago when it was written. It does not just
38:53
apply to them. It applies to us today. God is still speaking and and and and and and and there's a reason why we
38:59
don't read the Bible just one time and that's it. We continually read the word of God because God breathes new revelation upon his word every time we
39:06
read it. Um and so the same is true for teachings. Same is true because it's the
39:12
word of God coming forth. It's logos means the written word of God and Rama
39:17
means spoken word of God, prophetic word of God. The word of God spoken today. So it's the word of God nonetheless. So God
39:24
is going to be speaking new revelations through teachings for years to come. Um
39:31
and even the prophetic words, those prophetic words are, you know,
39:37
these words for revival, this is a revival that will not end. Glory to God.
39:44
So even these words, prophetic words for revival, they will keep being true. You know
39:51
there's so many prophetic words even I've given of like the importance of the importance to pass
39:58
the baton that prophetic word I shared about how God is asking uh Christian leaders
40:05
especially in the older generations to pass the baton to the Joshua generation that he has risen up to bring forth his
40:12
revival. uh that still rings true almost I think
40:18
2 years later it will be this coming October that is a word he is still speaking now
40:25
to people there's some people that need to hear that word now and
40:31
some I believe will hear that word from God and follow it hallelujah
40:36
um and other prophetic words that I've shared even for a revival
40:43
such as how the importance of people humbling themselves
40:49
to be able to receive this new wine, this new wine revelation.
40:55
Uh like prophetic words such as that, for example, that's going to keep on applying because the enemy's,
41:03
you know, that there's not going to be come a time where the enemy is going to give up. you know, we will continually overcome him, but you know, years from
41:10
now, the devil's still going to be angry at revival, revival growing, and he
41:16
will, you know, he will always try to keep, he will always try to fight people from coming into the revival.
41:22
Everyone who enters the revival, who's a part of the revival, who's a revival warrior,
41:28
they've gone through a boot camp. They've gone through a refining fire boot camp. It didn't come easy. They
41:34
came there by choice. They came there by resisting the enemy's lies and choosing to obey God and be a fighter to fight
41:40
the good fight of faith. So that will continue to be true. That word will
41:47
continue to need go to to go forth like prophetic words about the revival about how to enter in revival about how to
41:54
receive everything that God is releasing in this revival.
41:59
People will still need to be hearing that years to come from now.
42:05
What has been the most important lesson you've learned in stewarding the anointing and revival?
Lessons in stewarding revival
42:12
Wow, that's a good question.
42:17
Um, the two things that just came to my mind immediately is this. There's so much
42:23
I've learned. The two things that just came to mind immediately I'll share. Um
42:29
the first thing is that it is not a sprint.
42:36
It is not a sprint. Doing the work of God and
42:42
stewarding revival and spreading revival. It is not a sprint but it's a race of
42:48
endurance and um it's a marathon. and um just the
42:53
importance of consistency and how it's so important just like this consistency
42:59
just like that's true leadership that's true strength
43:07
it it's it's touching God's heart the most is when he can rely on us as when we will just he can he can count on us
43:14
we will keep doing his work in good times and bad times in the midst of wild
43:20
persecution in the midst of promises fulfilled, we will just we will be we will be the
43:26
same. Um and when we think of revival, when we think
43:32
of the anointing, it's many times just thinking of
43:37
explosion, excitement, sprinting, like sprinting with your torch, like you
43:44
know, explosion. Even like when revival first broke out with such an explosion
43:50
in 2021 and I was ministering every single week in a different state and
43:57
nation. Um but what I found is like the enemy
44:02
the enemy will attack. Persecution will come and
44:09
when that happens the work must go on. And God wants you to keep doing the work
44:15
with the same passion, with the same devotion, um,
44:22
with the same joy, with the same passion for his people,
44:27
with the same servant heart. And his vindication doesn't come
44:32
immediately. So, I've just seen such a journey of
44:38
like mountains and valleys, mountains and valleys. Um, and like valleys taking
44:43
longer than you want them to take, you know, but God is the one in control. God
44:48
is the one that has the road map. He is the GPS. And his ways are perfect. And so, so
44:57
often we want to sprint. We want to just go really fast and rest
45:03
and celebrate and just go really fast and rest and celebrate. But it's that
45:09
consistency that God that is so important to God. And that is what leads to such a big
45:15
harvest and God's promises fulfilled is that continual sewing into the field.
45:21
Continually sewing when it's hard, when it's when you don't want to be sewing, but you keep on going. Um, and so I know
45:30
like even the growth that God has brought at 5F Church, the growth how we have people
45:37
planted from 62 nations and the growth, the growth online, the
45:44
growth just at events like all of the growth that's taken place and the growth
45:50
of anointing and the growth of lasting fruits, the growth of real disciples who are surrendered to God, who are being
45:56
used powerfully by God, the growth that we have small groups and we have a bunch of leaders who can lead these small
46:01
groups. Hallelujah. With spiritual wisdom and maturity like all of that has come from
46:08
running the marathon with Jesus and not giving up and being consistent.
46:13
Um and I know that the promises that will be fulfilled
46:18
in the future that are so massive like bigger than the promises that I and we
46:23
have currently seen be fulfilled. Those promises that will come to pass in the future so massive,
46:32
it it will be because like they will have happened because of God number one
46:38
of course, but number two because of the obedience and of consistency like that
46:44
consistency that that obedience and consistency week after week, month after month, year
46:51
after year and the consistency of attitude, the consistency to not complain consistency to show up um and
46:58
do your best and work with excellence and the consistency to put others before
47:04
yourself and be servant-hearted. That consistency for me, but also the revival army and
47:11
the leaders that God has risen up and continues to rise up.
47:17
So, people may wonder like, wow, like how did this happen? How how have you
47:25
seen this take place? How have you seen this revival grow like this? How how are
47:31
you seeing all these fruits? And it's like that's a big secret, a big secret of
47:37
stewarding it so it can grow and see these massive promises of God
47:42
come to pass is that consistency. And that's what God's taught me over time is like,
47:48
why haven't other promises come to pass yet? And it's like God is teaching me these
47:55
promises don't come until this that you you you you keep going.
48:03
You know this destination doesn't come through until passing these roads. You have to keep going. You have to keep
48:10
showing up. You have to keep going on this journey.
48:18
like it says on the GPS like continue for this amount of miles. It's like you have to keep going if you actually want
48:24
to reach the destination. So that's one of the biggest ones. And then the other big one
48:32
big lesson that I've learned is the importance of staying focused on
48:39
Jesus and serving him alone and not other people. I mean not caring what other people
48:45
think. Um, there's just so much persecution that comes along with it. And
48:53
you just have to lay down your ego. You have to lay down your reputation. You
48:59
you you have to or you will never make it. So you you have to not care what
49:05
people think. You have to only obey Jesus and only care about what he thinks. You have to
49:12
keep believing that God will fight your battles for you and he will bring
49:18
vindication in his perfect timing. You have to
49:23
keep that faith or else you won't be able to keep going.
49:28
You have to keep that faith and keep your eyes focused on Jesus and not what
49:33
people think about you or say about you. Hallelujah. I want to pray over you all
49:39
right now. Uh, thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. God, I thank you for what you did today
49:45
and all of the wisdom you released and the way you opened up spiritual eyes for
49:51
your people. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Holy Spirit. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. I speak right now that whatever
50:00
thing you came here needing, whatever miracle you needed, whatever healing you
50:05
needed, I speak this anointing to come upon your life. And may these miracles be released upon you. May you receive
50:12
healing now in your body. And may every demonic oppression leave you in Jesus
50:19
name. May every every demonic burden weight upon your life be lifted in Jesus' name.
50:26
Uh, and I speak that everything that has been holding you back from knowing God's
50:32
love and from being able to serve him in the capacity he's he's asking of you,
50:37
this must go from you now in Jesus' name. I release this anointing upon you
50:44
now. May more of the fire of the Holy Spirit come upon you, fill you, and may
50:52
your joy increase. May your peace increase in Jesus' name. May the love of
50:58
God fill you, be upon you. May your eyes open up more to Jesus's love for you and
51:06
to the the the the secrets of the spiritual realm in Jesus name. May you have more understanding. May you grow in
51:13
this wisdom in Jesus' name. And thank you Jesus. I speak this
51:19
anointing to move powerfully through you to touch others. May your light shine
51:25
bright in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
