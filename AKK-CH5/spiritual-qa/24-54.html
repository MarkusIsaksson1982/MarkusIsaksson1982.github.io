how to know when what God is asking you to post like testimonies isn't coming from the angel of Light are all
0:06
testimonies led by the Holy Spirit or can it be in wisdom um
0:12
well there are some cases where people can
0:18
have selfish ambition want to look really spiritual want people to see them
0:23
as really anointed want people to see them as so much like Jesus
0:30
um and then there can be this the the the bigger motivation it
0:36
can be the twart motivation it can be one person like this person does love
0:41
God but at the same time they are dealing with these selfish
0:48
ambition uh struggles um and
0:54
so you have to walk in wisdom with what you're putting out there with what you're testifying to
1:01
know what's behind it what what is really the motivating factor if really
1:07
what is pushing it what's motivating you is you know like what makes you so excited is to see oh people are going to
1:15
see me as more as so much like Jesus people are going to be um impressed by
1:21
um what God did through me you know if you're feeling that a lot and that's
1:27
what's really exciting you even when still there's a love of God not saying
1:32
that a person's completely fake but when that that's the driving motivation
1:38
that's an indicator that um it is it is
1:43
Angel of Lights involved meaning in the Bible it says the Devil mascarat Himself as an angel of
1:49
Light um and we don't need to be posting all the time testimonies all the
1:57
time of every little every little thing um what's what's important is that we're
2:02
being led by the Holy Spirit um like for example in my life I don't post every
2:09
single you know interaction I have with people and how um God moved through me
2:15
to touch another person and I I I don't do that that would be like too much I
2:20
mean it would be like overboard it would be too many posts per day I walk with
2:26
wisdom and I go by the leading of the Holy Spirit um you know what should I post today out of
2:34
so much of what God's doing what sh what is what what do you want to come out to
2:40
the world and speak through Lord um just like I could preach for hours and hours
2:48
all day every day but limit it to what holy spirit is leading um so that it's
2:55
really doing the most because it's led by the Holy Spirit and not led by um man
3:05
amen so yeah so um this is so so when it comes to like
3:14
selfish ambition and trying to look important and spiritual and everything if if one is finding that
3:21
it's very important you surrender to God and be real with God be open be naked
3:26
before God and say Lord I'm dealing with all of these these Ambitions motivations
3:33
thoughts um and I need your help it's a lot of impurity the first thing the most
3:39
important thing to do is to go to God about this and be naked before him and
3:45
do this work to do the spiritual work to have a pure heart humble heart and
3:52
[Music] um and and and and not focus so much on posting
3:58
on overp posting for example but really make sure you're getting those ambition
4:03
selfish Ambitions motivations out um because as I shared in the message a a
4:11
message on Sunday a few weeks ago um about purity in the church the first
4:16
message I shared I shared a lot on this topic and I shared
4:21
how you know you C you can have this this this this this issue where you have
4:28
genuine love for God person really does love God but then there is a lot of
4:33
selfish ambition that they haven't really dealt with they haven't really surrendered everything and the angel of
4:40
Light the devil knows and he can come as an angel of Light the devil knows this and cap can capitalize on this um and so
4:49
that's where you can have this you could be doing something good
4:55
but with the wrong heart and so it's it's tainted you know um so that's
5:02
something to take very seriously something to take very seriously so if you
5:09
are getting a rise out of getting really excited for the wrong reasons right like
5:16
when you're posting something good for example testifying about something good
5:22
but the big thing that's making you really the most excited is this selfish
5:28
ambition thing how people see you or whatever um that's
5:33
an indicator you need to slow down maybe just stop don't focus
5:39
on don't focus on like putting stuff out so much but focus
5:46
on cleaning your heart with Jesus allowing Allowing God to change change you transform you clean you and this is
5:54
why I sh you know the message I shared by the way the message I'm talking about Purity in the church it's so important
6:01
for the body of Christ because it's just I mean it's so important first of all for you to be aware that this is this
6:07
can be going on so to not just put follow people just because
6:16
of what they're putting out you know to not foolishly make someone a leader that
6:23
God didn't call you to follow to not just see someone as a role
6:29
model that God didn't call you to um that's why it's very important because
6:35
we don't know fully the heart sometimes so it's just important we're not um just
6:40
jumping to conclusions when that's we're not supposed to be doing that we're not supposed to be having our eyes there how
6:46
to know if it's God's timing to move somewhere um well most of it is having
6:52
to do with wisdom um which I've talked a lot about
6:57
uh I'm trying to think of the the names of the messages that really teach about made in God's image is one of the
7:04
messages um where you can learn more about that I know I was teaching quite a bit about that on past recent past
7:09
subscriber q&as but
7:16
um let me give you a personal example first of all for me for moving wise so I
7:22
lived in an apartment in um North Hollywood and it wasn't in the greatest
7:28
area it was wasn't like really bad but it wasn't really in the nicest area actually someone I mean people had
7:36
broken into our garage and broken into cars like several
7:41
times and so using wisdom it was like God was
7:46
speaking through this and I was this is when I was um pastoring the church for
7:53
um a few years and actually Revival broke out when I was living in this
8:00
apartment and I continued to live in that part apartment for uh a few months
8:05
after Revival broke out from revival broke out in May 30th and then I moved
8:12
out in October of that same year but maybe like a year and a half or
8:18
so before Revival broke out I that was still in a place where it
8:23
was money was very tight that was the pl that was the time where my parents were supporting me but I you know was really
8:32
not I mean it was just bare minimum like just rent and the bare
8:37
necessities and me there was no like income really that I was getting so um
8:43
but I knew like with this the way the apartment was how it wasn't the safest
8:48
and because of the anointing I carry like specifically for my calling especially uh the standard should be
8:56
higher um so I knew and I actually um I had spoken to my spiritual father
9:02
for wisdom and advice in that area too and you know he said yes it's look for other places he advised that and um so I
9:10
started looking for other places and then I found when I was looking that um
9:17
every place I looked at was was so much smaller for a more
9:24
expensive price than what I was currently paying and it was just it felt like
9:29
roadblock like man I can't find a single play I kept looking I kept looking I kept looking and ultimately it was not
9:37
God's timing but it was like it was time to start looking and time to start you
9:43
know walking in wisdom and seeing what's out there and not not being so much just like it's time to is it time to look for
9:50
it's it time to move out God but more like walking in wisdom like I know that
9:55
it's going to be time to move soon I'm going to take this step and start looking and from there we will see using
10:02
wisdom and also doors opening if it's God's exact timing to really move um or
10:10
that it would be later and so I came to the conclusion with wisdom led by the holy spirit that it wasn't God's timing
10:17
yet it just it wasn't that right it's you know when it's God's timing it it
10:22
just wasn't that timing it those doors weren't opening up and nothing was
10:28
looking better than where I was that um and so I think that was a year and a half or so before the Revival
10:34
broke out and then the Revival broke out and then um people started to donate people started to give to the ministry
10:40
and so I was in a place where I financially I could um I could start
10:47
looking for for nicer for a nicer place than I currently was again because I had stopped looking for a year and a for a
10:53
year and a half and so um then I found I
10:58
found a place and it I was traveling every single week every single week I was traveling at this time and I just
11:05
started traveling every single week for only two months and um I was like how am
11:10
I going to squeeze and looking for an apartment last time I looked for an apartment I was looking everywhere and it took so much
11:18
time and I got nowhere you know so I remember thinking that like how is this going to work with me traveling every
11:26
week I need like many days like usually it's a usually have to search and search and search and search search and every
11:31
every experience with me trying to find an apartment like in in La I've had to search for weeks I've had to visit
11:37
several Apartments um many of them I didn't receive acceptance because it was
11:43
a competition of other people you know um so that's how I'm thinking but then I
11:49
found I was looking online and I only found like two places that um looked
11:55
that worked type thing um with everything I needed and then so I went to look at one place on my one day off
12:04
and I looked at it and it was perfect it was beyond my dreams it was affordable
12:09
it was in a nice neighborhood and um and and and and
12:15
there were other people that were competing to have it and there was tremendous favor of God the doors opened
12:22
up I received the place IM like immediately it was offered to me and so
12:28
I just give that whole story to show you um just a testimony just a testimony a
12:33
practical example of the timing of God when it comes to moving so like I
12:38
desired in my heart to move way earlier but it wasn't God's timing and it's
12:44
important to have wisdom it's important to have wisdom and and just know the importance of God's timing like I could
12:50
have been stubborn like it's not safe here I need to move
12:55
ASAP I could have been prideful and been like I'm anointed it's not safe Mom and Dad give me more money or
13:01
something you know I could have been like that but the thing was was like God's hand was protecting me that's how
13:07
it is in many situations like it's a combination of wisdom but we we H and also knowing God's
13:14
Supernatural hand coming like one could think wisdom is like a plus b equals c
13:19
this doesn't seem very safe here I must move immediately so but it's it's a combination of yes these are signs that
13:27
you need a higher standard you need to move but we really need to consult the
13:32
Holy Spirit he can put his hand of protection over you and protect you even though
13:38
this place isn't the most wise safe place to move to wait upon his timing to wait upon the doors he opens up a
13:46
provision that's what happened that's what happened with me um and so so yeah
13:51
like sometimes we can feel like I want to move I want to move I want to move but there's not really a need yet it's
13:59
it's more of just us Desiring to you know whether that's to a different city whether that's to um just a different
14:06
apartment um and this comes with all decisions you know this is a good
14:11
example for kind of all decisions like practical decisions and and when it comes to like life
14:18
changes um so so yeah it's it's important to just use wisdom and go by
14:26
the leading of the Holy Spirit instead of One's Own emotions and even now like I've been I've lived
14:31
here for three years more than three years now and like there's a couple things in it like I need I don't I don't
14:40
really have like a walk-in closet really like there's not much closet space in this place um and like I really want a
14:47
backyard or at least a balcony but at least like a backyard so my desire in my heart is to to move right but it's not
14:55
God's timing right now and even though like I could choose to use finances
15:00
differently I know God doesn't want that right now it's not his timing so um it's
15:07
so important to deny yourself and uh and walk in wisdom and go by the leading of the holy spirit is it possible for
15:15
someone to have a gift to heal in the same way as a prophetic gift but use it
15:20
for Evil slash not in God's will how to discern this
15:29
yeah I would say actually the biggest misuse of God's gifts of God's anointing
15:35
is what I just shared in the first question the first the first
15:41
answer which is when it's like half and half heart because God doesn't wait till
15:46
we're perfect to use us I shared as I shared I keep referring
15:52
to this message so go back and listen to it if you haven't listened to it or watch it again um but this message
15:58
called Purity in the church um from lukewarm Christians to disciples that's the title of it from like a few weeks
16:05
ago or a month ago or so um yeah I shared in I shared in this message
16:14
how there can be people who are in the church and love God and
16:20
and but but they're not fully surrendered and the Temptation is is they're allowing the temptation of the
16:27
enemy of pride ego selfish ambition uh jealousy and um that leads them to
16:35
wrongly Steward Steward wrongly what they've been given what they've
16:41
received um you know I shared also when you are planted where the
16:48
anointing is the anointing is is coming upon you
16:53
and um if you have a willing heart to be used by God you know doesn't wait till
16:59
you're perfect to release impartation of anointing to you he will wait until
17:05
you've proven yourself trustworthy to release a big anointing to you A big
17:12
measure of anointing to you I mean um but even but but like when it comes
17:18
to small portions he releases it he's he he's ready to use you he
17:26
wants to see what you'll do with it he wants to test you with this um and this
17:31
anointing is so powerful when you when you come to the church where the anointing is really
17:37
flowing it's really coming upon your life and even if it's not impartation
17:42
like even if it's not like God is like I'm releasing impartation of anointing to you now so now you are walking in the
17:50
power of God even if it's not that because you're not ready for that yet that anointing that makes demons go
17:56
out of your life that's coming upon on
18:01
you I mean it's you know like the the handkerchiefs were just the handkerchiefs and aprons
18:09
were I mean soaked with the anointing from Apostle Paul so they were going on
18:16
people's skin people's bodies and demons were going and sick were being healed
18:21
and it's that anointing is on them and so you know you leave the church and you
18:27
can you you have anointing on you so like demons can react and and and and
18:35
leave people even even not even just that you've not even meaning
18:40
that you've received impartation of anointing but that's how powerful the anointing is you were just soaking in
18:45
the anointing and there's residuals of it on you um you know
18:53
like when you are with the anointed one you smell like the anointed one
18:59
when you plant yourself there and call yourself a spiritual child of them that
19:05
anointings upon it's like it's like if if um
19:12
if let's pretend I was to spray myself with [Music] perfume and then you hug me and then you
19:20
smell like that perfume and you know people come to you and you're like wow you smell amazing what's that perfume
19:26
and you can't even tell them where what what that perfume is it's just the effect of the
19:33
proximity um and so you know that's that's why it's so important you know
19:39
the message I preached about don't Rejoice that demons obey you rejoice that your name is written in
19:49
heaven um meaning don't don't take so
19:54
much credit and think yourself so great that demons are obeying you I mean in some in some
20:02
instances it's just because of where you're you're positioned like where it's
20:07
because you're you're hugging the one with the perfume you know it's it's hitting you but so the problem is is
20:14
that there's there's people that they're rejoicing over power that's on
20:22
them um and they they get excited about it
20:27
like in the in a wrong way like thinking oh I'm looking so powerful and and
20:33
taking the credit and all of that and so anyways like when it comes to people
20:40
misusing spiritual gifts misusing the anointing it's many times in a situation
20:45
like this like it it's not so much that God has
20:52
like anointed them but there is anointing upon them there's anointing on
20:59
them God God's gifts are without repentance they have spiritual gifts and
21:07
they can even be led by the angel of Light um not by the Holy Spirit but by the
21:14
angel of Light to use these gifts and things can really be happening
21:19
things can really be happening um you know because the the anointing is we we
21:26
we are given Authority so it's it's God doing the Miracles but there is this
21:32
principle of a measure of anointing that's released that we Steward that we uh are given Authority I mean we're
21:41
given authority to use that anointing right so like God's giving me this anointing and so for example I
21:49
could decide to go live every single day for two hours like every single day
21:56
right now in this season but God didn't ask me to do that that and but Miracles would be happening people would be
22:01
healed people would be delivered people would hear the word of God but it was out of God's order so
22:08
things are happening Miracles are happening yes and it seems like all this Good's happening but it's outside of
22:13
God's order maybe God didn't want me to do that because it was going to burn me out it was going to cause me to take my
22:20
focus off of him it was going to cause me to um just get tired and get sick get
22:27
sick because we have to take care of our bod so there can be repercussions what you sew you reap so I could literally
22:32
get sick not be able to do a flourish conference or something where God had really planned to release so much at the
22:39
flourish conference for example that was going to change the world like his strategy his intention with that you
22:45
know um so that's just a little example like like me like I could be doing all
22:51
these good things that looks so amazing that people could be like wow what you're doing is so incredible wow you're
22:57
you're ministering every single day like you're so selfless like people could be
23:02
saying that but I could I would be in Disobedience to God if God wasn't calling me to do that and so God's
23:08
looking like this even though all these people are being healed and delivered and everything you see
23:15
so how God has given us Authority like this like he's really given us Authority he's we we have the
23:23
choice so that's that's how the misuse happens usually that's how the misuse
23:30
happens is that it has been released to some people or just the perfume
23:36
analogy and the angel of Light and it can become even more complex where um I
23:43
mean demons familiar spirits observe people's um behaviors and everything and
23:51
the Devil is a spirit so I mean demons can observe behaviors and words that people
23:58
people are speaking and so someone can this is how psychics know the future and know
24:05
details um is because of demons giving there's demonic spirits like observing
24:12
especially when people are giv give access like demons can't be observing me for
24:19
example because I have door shut they can't just like come in my house right now and observe me but um
24:27
like if I speak at the church um I speak
24:32
in wisdom like I'm not going to be revealing things that God doesn't want me to reveal you know before like demons
24:39
for example like um maybe maybe if it's like God's plans for the future or
24:45
something certain plans that it's not timing to reveal it yet you know um
24:51
demon it's a public when I speak at the church for example it's public like it's being heard everywhere like anyone can
24:57
hear it so that means like demonic spirits and people can hear it you know um so anyways uh there's there's many
25:06
spirits everywhere that are observing many things that are observing many behaviors especially when people are giving
25:11
access when they themselves have demons or they have open doors it's like demons get to observe and everything so when a
25:18
person goes to a psychic and um the psychic knows all these things about their personal life it's because of
25:24
demons observing the person and demons speaking to the psychic so um you know the angel of Light that's
25:33
the the devil masc masquerades himself as an angel of Light so there are people that seeming to be prophets or seeming
25:40
to be having a prophetic gift sometime that are actually hearing from from the
25:46
devil and the devil's specifically speaking like Godly seeming things
25:52
coming as an angel of Light um number one to try to fool this
25:59
this child of God servant of God to think it's really God giving them these
26:04
prophetic giftings and insights and also to fool people um so how do you know the
26:11
fruits the fruits you shall know them by the fruits if one per if a person is disobeying God like this the fruits will
26:18
be able to be seen um there will not be Purity in this person's life in this
26:25
person's Ministry and God will give you ice to see whether there's not Purity whether there's not humility for example
26:32
um and I I can I've like for example I've here's an example I've seen it like I've seen I've seen this kind of thing
26:40
happening with with someone before and um like someone who is calling
26:45
themselves like a servant of God and and you know this is just this I don't publicly talk about this like this
26:52
person and this is what they're doing no no because that's not my calling that's not what we're called to do it's
26:58
we're called to whether they preach with bad motives or not whether they preach
27:04
out of jealousy or not um let them and let the people see themselves like you
27:10
have seen if they have pure hearts they will see the fruits but I've seen for example like the way one ministers it's
27:19
kind of like showing off looking like there's just this element of um you know just you can sense imper you
27:28
you can sense not total Purity and not total looking like want really wanting
27:33
God to get the glory but this sense of look at me like look how impressive this
27:40
is you know that's just an example and I mean we got to be careful to not judge because sometimes walking in our
27:46
Authority um can look prideful to some people you know like being confident in
27:51
your Authority um you know one two three leave you know um
27:58
even different blowing or just doing different things with your body that God instructs like wave the
28:05
hand like some people that you know confidence they can they can perceive
28:10
wrongly as um being prideful and we're supposed to be confident in our
28:16
Authority and we're supposed to be like uh-uh devil I don't think so I am a
28:22
anointed servant of God and you have to obey when I command like we are called
28:28
to be like this like confident in our Authority confident in our Authority as
28:33
sons and daughters so we have to be careful to not to not judge but I'm just
28:39
I'm just giving you an example of like one you see with a pure heart not in a judgmental way but just when you're
28:44
looking with a pure heart and you just notice the difference between Purity
28:52
like not trying to show off at all and then like okay there might be some
28:57
trying to show show off but this is why I shared recently in my message it's so important we don't judge because some
29:03
people some people are judging wrongly and they're speaking out about it and they're judging wrongly some people are
29:09
thinking someone's showing off but really they're just walking in confidence um in their Authority in
29:14
Christ and so that's why it's so it's so wrong to just be speaking out like this because you can just be mistaken you can
29:22
just be mistaken you can just not have the knowledge of no we should walk in
29:27
confidence in our Authority in Christ you can just not not be having that knowledge and then judge someone for
29:35
simply doing what God has called them to do and being confident and strong in their Authority and say that they're trying to show off so I just give you an
29:41
example like from the heart how we judge fruits which is more which is instead
29:47
instead of judging I'll say making the decision good fruits
29:53
versus bad fruits I wish that more people would be this way like
29:58
I wish more people would just observe like I don't sense like pure pure fruits
30:04
fruits here okay I'm not going to go here this not for me I see Purity here I'm going
30:09
to go here I wish it was more that way instead of like bashing um but just like making your
30:16
decision and then as you see what's true and pure um draw attention there draw attention
30:23
this is Purity this is this is good fruits this is what good fruits are to help people discern there's in the body
30:30
of Christ day there's so much bashing there's so much bashing going on
30:36
um and that's not our calling and um it's bringing confusion rather than
30:42
helping people really be able to discern between good and bad fruit and find the true fruit I couldn't see pure fruits
30:49
well because I didn't know this level of Purity at 5 have existed Autumn says glory to God and that's that's exactly
30:56
what I'm sharing right now like there's been such a lack of Purity
31:03
that people are just bashing each other and they don't even know what true
31:10
Purity is and it's just brings a lot of confusion and what is so important now
31:17
is to show like in this end time Revival what the Real Purity is what real pure leadership looks like and to really um
31:25
testify about it and help people to see look look look look look what God's doing look how God's purifying his
31:31
church look how he's brought pure leadership look how he's brought true anointing look look what it look how
31:38
God's getting all the glory look at this is fruit you know that I've never seen
31:44
before look look look look that's that's how people's eyes will open up and more
31:51
people will come and come out of the wrong fruit come out of the the impurity places and come to the truth
31:58
if I brought someone to church who does not value the anointing but he needs healing should I continue inviting and
32:05
encouraging attendance for those who are Skeptics just walk in wisdom um if they
32:10
are open keep inviting if they are um not open you know if you can sense that
32:17
you're being like forceful overbearing it like that's how they're seeing
32:23
it then ju stop stop inviting um but
32:28
continue to share your light on your social media people see social media so
32:34
um you know you are inviting everyone on your social media page every time you
32:40
share what God's doing every time you share a testimony a message um a miracle that God's done
32:47
anything that's part of this end time Revival you know every time you share on social media that's the action of you
32:54
inviting all of your followers all of your family and friends they're seeing it um so you know know that know the
33:02
power of that but if one seems open definitely keep inviting
33:07
them what's the difference between a prophet in the old wine and a prophet walking in the new wine is there a
33:14
difference um so I'm going to change this question to prophit and just be like to any servant of God any vessel of
33:21
God um so you know God is doing a new thing now
33:28
he's a God who brings new who does new things
33:33
um the way Billy Graham came he he came with an anointing of evangelism it was a
33:40
new thing God did through him I mean filling stadiums all over the world and
33:46
there was just this anointing upon Billy Graham to convict people to not live in
33:52
the world anymore to make a decision and to give their life to Jesus um that that was a new thing that
33:58
God God did through him and there could have been critics at his time you know
34:05
saying why are you filling stadiums and preaching the same thing over and over again or something uh you should build a
34:13
church and focus there and build people there he could have I don't know I don't know the whole history I know some but I
34:19
don't know the whole history of his critics but I'm just giv an example that could have happened that probably did happen you know what he did was
34:25
something new it's was rare you weren't I I don't think you're ever seeing that um but it was a new thing that God was
34:31
doing that God wanted to do right then and there uh and so God continues to do new
34:37
God continues to do new things and so now God is bringing his power restoring
34:45
his power restoring his fightful ministry res restoring deliverance and
34:50
Healing Ministry in the church and because that's been missing for so long
34:55
he wants so much of a focus to be on that so much of a focus to be on the apostolic and prophetic Ministries so
35:01
much of a focus to be on Deliverance and healing there's so much of a need that's a big reason why there needs to be a focus because people are dying people
35:09
are dying with oppression people being tortured by demonic oppression unnecessarily because Jesus the deliver
35:15
his anointing is here now um but also because it's God's God's specific plan
35:21
now to restore these things to the body of Christ so there needs to be a great
35:27
Focus there and in restoring these things and restoring these Ministries
35:32
and restoring the Deliverance Ministry for example it's going to come with all this Revelation that's been missing
35:39
Deliverance there's been it's been so rare people don't know about it I know even me um until until
35:48
uh about eight years ago or eight and a half years ago or so I did not even know
35:55
what Deliverance was what the word Deliverance meant I did not know that
36:00
demons existed today I didn't know that addiction was actually a demon Suicidal Thoughts was actually a demon I I didn't
36:08
know any of that and I am like much of the body of Christ how I was is like much of the body of Christ so there's
36:15
like no no almost hardly any knowledge on Deliverance and
36:20
so the Deliverance Ministry requires so much Revelation like what makes demons go how
36:28
to adequately cast out demons um The Godly way the way God
36:34
wants a revelation of authority you know so
36:40
um the new wine is about this this is the new revelation God's
36:46
bringing new meaning restored from The Acts Church Revelation that Apostle Paul
36:52
and Peter had and the other Apostles that's been lost so now it becomes like
36:58
new for this generation for the generations today that are alive today it becomes new wine not new to Peter and
37:05
Paul and the apostles not new to Jesus but new for us new for the body of Christ new
37:12
wine so then you have you know it's like before Billy
37:17
Graham no one was doing what Billy Graham was doing it was a new thing so before before what God is doing now
37:24
bringing this Deliverance Revival and Apostolic and prophetic Ministries
37:30
no one's doing that I don't mean no one but most aren't doing that most aren't doing that and so there's still Servants
37:38
of God that have been around but they weren't doing this just like there were Servants of God before Billy Graham that
37:43
wasn't doing what Billy Graham was doing but they were still Servants of God right it's just that God chose to do
37:48
something fresh and new upon Billy Graham and not the ones before him so now in this revival God is choosing to
37:54
do something fresh and new release fresh new revelation new wine to Servants of
38:00
God new Servants of God he's raising up to the new generation Joshua generation and that Revelation is
38:06
released to the Joshua generation that that Revelation is not released to the prior generation it's it's coming to the
38:13
prior generation if they will humble themselves and receive through the Joshua generation where he's released
38:19
it just like Billy Graham was young was really young when he when when God Rose
38:25
him up and they were older people older Servants of God that had to choose
38:30
whether to receive what God was doing through him and cheer him on and use their platforms
38:38
to say this is a chosen one of God and and cheer him on you know they could choose to do that and choose to receive
38:45
the that Grace that God had put upon Billy Graham or not they could choose to be prideful and be like I'm I know
38:53
everything who are you you're young like what is this you're doing I you know I know best right and so that there they
39:01
were the old wine and he was the new wine in terms of like what God was doing there for specifically that thing for
39:06
evangelism for example he was bringing something new so now you have today um
39:12
people who are truly Servants of God but not carrying this new wine in the area
39:19
of of the revelation of the fful ministry Apostolic prophetic the revelation of
39:25
Deliverance Ministry the revelation of the anointing the revelation of walking in Authority in Christ there's so much
39:32
that God's doing now just not just one little thing there's a lot there's a lot of new revelation that he's releasing
39:39
now so um you know you can have people who have been casting out demons before in the past but God is
39:47
bringing he's bringing new wine Revelation now of when it in the area of
39:53
Deliverance right so like for example like like what God has released to me in
39:59
my Ministry um is the power of God in the the importance of the power of God
40:05
in Simplicity the revelation of authority in Christ the revelation of
40:10
what truly makes demons go is your Authority is not physical effort is not
40:16
gimmicks is not a show is not extra things like amplifying the voice and
40:23
pushing people down and putting objects on them none of that it is the the the power of
40:31
God and simplicity the authority of Christ carrying the true anointing
40:37
knowing who you are knowing what you carry and walk simp simply walking in
40:44
your Authority so like it's the new wine re it's it's like how Peter ministered how
40:50
Paul ministered so so easily not long oneon-one prayer no tons of people being
40:56
delivered and heal the one time just positioning themselves where the anointing was flowing through Peter walking by Bo boom boom boom demons
41:03
leaving up the was like crazy people being healed everywhere fast tons of people at one time not one-on-one prayer
41:12
a whole long one-on-one prayer line no it was the anointing the power of God and simplicity it was walking in the
41:18
authority in Christ and and truly carrying the power of God Peter carrying this high level anointing these demons
41:25
had to obey and Obey quickly simply by God's power and the vessel walking in the authority none of this
41:31
physical effort stuff um same with Paul with the handkerchiefs and aprons that they just
41:37
brought to his body and then put the handkerchiefs and aprons on the the demon oppressed and the the sick and
41:42
they were healed and delivered like that fast quick wasn't a it wasn't a need of
41:48
one-on-one prayer for everybody so that's what we have now we have like
41:54
like Servants of God in old wine and um not having the new wine Revelation and
42:00
doing things the way that they've been done the way that they were taught from the previous generation and having more to do with oneon-one prayer only and
42:08
physical effort maybe amplifying the voice and putting physical objects and putting physical effort like pushing p a
42:15
person down and really like fighting with demons really fighting like Deliverance is seen so much as like this
42:21
big combat with demons where you got to you got to sweat you got to lose your voice it's going to take several hours
42:27
you know it's going to take a lot of different things that's like the old wine um way um and and and they may be
42:37
seeing some demons goal but not really the the the amount that could be free like
42:44
was in the times of Peter when we're doing it with the new wine Revelation so so yeah so that's that's
42:52
the difference that's the difference and so now it's time for the
42:58
the Servants of God and others who who are from the previous generation or same
43:03
generation but carrying don't know about the new wine yet don't know about the new revelation new wine Revelation it's
43:08
time for them to Humble themselves and receive what God has released now this
43:14
new revelation he's released now how can you help someone who has been hurt by impure leaders in the body
43:20
open their heart to accept pure leaders
43:28
I would just say to share your testimony just gently not forcefully you know just share your
43:34
testimony um if your testimony involves having Church hurt how you've been
43:40
healed and how you're so grateful for it because you just realize that this is
43:45
God's ways like we we we are made to have to have a Shepherd we are we need
43:51
that we need an apostle Paul of today to follow as he or she follows
43:57
Christ and we are missing out on so much equipping spiritual covering impartation
44:04
of anointing and anointing to heal and to receive healing and deliverance if we
44:09
be stubborn to this principle from God um but yeah I just I I think it I
44:18
mean what's really important now is to just share testimony share fruits that's
44:23
what draws people that's what opens up eyes um [Music]
44:29
it it's a process for some people to like not see with judgment but to finally see with a more of a pure heart
44:37
um but the more and more and more fruits the more hard it is to deny and I've
44:43
seen so many testimonies of this it's really encouraging me like the
44:48
first couple years or so after Revival broke out it was so disheartening to see a lot
44:56
of people people deceived and to see people not see the fruits or reject the true pure fruits from my Ministry it was
45:04
so sad disheartening to see them deceived by these lies these false
45:09
accusations these exposed videos and everything it was so disheartening to to to see that many of them they tasted the
45:17
fruit to themselves like they've been healed they've been delivered they've been changed there's been no kind of bad
45:22
fruit that they've tasted themselves they just simply believed these lack
45:27
and um chose to forget about the fruits and so that was really disheartening
45:33
um and it gave you it was interesting timing because I you know these
45:39
prophecies from my spiritual father were so massive as I've shared I haven't shared in detail all of them but I have
45:45
shared with you it's like we've only seen about 1% of what God has in
45:51
store so it's God's plan to reach so
45:57
many more people and for just so many doors to
46:03
open up where they've you know remain shut because of the enemy trying hard to
46:08
stop the move of God God's going to open up the doors the walls of Jericho are going to come down there's going to be
46:13
more walls of Jericho that come down just like they did when the Revival first broke
46:19
out um and uh but yeah so I would you know I
46:24
receiv received these huge prophecies and then um to see all these people like not see
46:32
the truth not believe the truth so easily believe all these lies it was disheartening and I remember feeling
46:39
like what like I believe these prophecies will come to pass but it feels like the majority are believing
46:46
these lies it was disheartening it really was disheartening like how can people see the truth but now God's shown
46:53
me something I've really learned a lot like that was that was just the first couple years maybe I was feeling that
47:00
way but now I've seen so many testimonies of people who were confused
47:05
by the videos and the lies and the false accusations and even or or or they just
47:11
were skeptical they were just skeptical or maybe they they really believe the lies whatever but then they kept seeing
47:19
testimonies and they couldn't deny it it's like they realized they had been fooled they realized these really were
47:27
lies so these people at first judged at first were skeptical at first were
47:32
fooled were deceived by the lies but the testimonies continued to pour
47:39
out the fruits continue to show and God would make sure they'd see it
47:45
supernaturally you know and um He blesses the work of our hands as we
47:51
share the testimonies and now so many people testify to this day sharing that
47:57
their eyes opened up that they see it's true they see its
48:02
true fruit so God taught me a lot that it's it's in his timing we have to have
48:09
patience and just wait on him and just keep doing the work of God keep sharing
48:14
keep testifying seeds are being planted God is blessing the work of your hands and
48:21
angels are behind the scenes moving in the spirit fighting this war for
48:27
removing these lies out of people's minds that the devil's put and eyes are opening up eyes will
48:35
open up so yeah that's my big thing I want to share about you know people who
48:41
have had Church heard and everything just share your testimony continue to share on your own page continue to show
48:49
the fruits and on on God in God's timing on their time and their free will they
48:54
their eyes open up and they will see how do we have more reverence for God is
49:00
it a choice like Faith yes so once your eyes open up to
49:07
what's right and what's wrong the balls in your court so much of it is having to
49:13
do with your choice and your intention and the renewing of your
49:18
mind so God opens up your eyes through the word of God through the spoken word
49:24
of God just opens up your eyes I should have the fear of God I should be reverent towards God I should have more
49:30
of the fear of God I'm not have I'm not having that much fear of God I should have more of the fear of God this is
49:35
what's right like when your eyes open up to that truth what do you then do to make that come in your life now that
49:41
you're convicted it's mostly the choice it's the choice and then the intention and
49:48
then that is giving permission for God to come help you for God to change you
49:57
but um our daily lives should
50:02
be with the intention of I want to serve you today I want to
50:08
please you today Lord I am about my father's business not my own
50:13
business I want to I I want to touch your heart Lord I am a servant of
50:19
you that should be your intention every day and you got to renew your mind to
50:25
make that your intention and then when you have other things that are trying to get in the way you need to take action
50:30
you need to reject those thoughts those lies you need to come naked before God and say Lord I need your help I want to
50:37
always rever you always fear you always to be in your will always to please you but I recognize there's some selfish
50:43
ambition thoughts a lot for example there's things some things from my past that I haven't changed yet from I had
50:49
you know before I was saved for example there was selfish ambition or before I was fully surrendered there was selfish
50:55
ambition and I recognize that there hasn't been a total change in this area Lord I need your help I do not want to
51:02
be lukewarm I do not want to be led by the angel of Light I do not want to have one foot in one foot out I want to be
51:09
perfectly in your will Lord so help me God this is what I want and make that your prayer every day if that's what you
51:16
struggle with make that your intention renew your mind renew your mind I must
51:22
have the fear of God I must rever him I must be after his heart I must
51:27
just be a servant of him and that will automatically I mean that will start to
51:33
change you you will start to just be that person now you will just start to be a person who just fears God you will just start to be a person who's thinking
51:39
about God first and not yourself and it will just change your whole life all the decisions you make
51:45
will you'll like naturally make decisions now that are not about yourself but are having to do with
51:51
pleasing God serving him putting him first his people first
51:57
and I just want to say a general um a general statement right now um that
52:05
I I see Will pertain to someone's question um if you do not see your
52:10
leader doing something pay attention to that you know
52:15
um there's some questions that you already have the answer for as Paul says
52:20
follow me as I follow Jesus so if you don't see me doing
52:27
something then that there's a reason for example if I'm your leader
52:33
for example right and so sometimes I sometimes I see questions right now where I'm like you already know the
52:39
answer you know there's sometime I mean I think sometimes people like they they know deep down but
52:47
they're like hoping you know it's different so that's just I just want to
52:53
because I can't answer every question here and so sometimes I walk in wisdom like you know I I'm not going to answer
53:00
this question right now there's I I I can't answer this question right now but like led by the Holy Spirit but you have
53:06
the answer you have the answer is it wisdom to cast out demons
53:12
just anywhere and I see there's another question like in the grocery
53:17
store I have many sermons several sermons that speak exactly on this in
53:23
detail so I don't have time to share like the enti higher teaching about this right now so I want to encourage you to
53:30
look at these messages I'm trying to remember um one that's coming to mind
53:37
they're all on most of them are on the Revival army training playlist on my YouTube link in my bio Revival army
53:43
training playlist one of them is called order in the church order in the church
53:49
so this teaches on that topic quite a bit and um oh another one is that I'm
53:56
remembering right now it's also on the Revival army training playlist and it's also on the secret of the anointing
54:03
playlist I did a whole big teaching in depth um on my book going in depth
54:13
teaching even Beyond a series on my book The Secret of the anointing but there's a message there a two-part message how
54:19
to cast out demons and heal the sick it's a two-part message and in one of
54:25
those messes me I'm forgetting which right now I'm thinking it might be part two but in one of those messages um I
54:32
speak on like how to cast out demons in this area like how to know when the right
54:38
time is to cast out a demon so make sure you listen to that
54:44
but I'll give you a really short quick answer summary right now but please go answer listen to that for more in-depth
54:50
uh teaching um but yeah when when what makes demons go is
54:56
number one um that they see you have authority
55:02
over them they see that you truly have anointing and Authority remember that the the the
55:10
demons the demons could see that Paul had anointing and authority over them and Jesus but they did not see anointing
55:18
and Authority in the sons of ska over them even though they were calling on the name of Jesus they believed in
55:24
Jesus's power you know and that's a picture not just Believers versus
55:29
non-believers that's a picture of how Believers have to actually have
55:36
anointing and authority and I teach more in depth on this in the messages like how to receive
55:42
more Authority how to know how much Authority you have because there's different levels of demonic Powers first
55:47
of all um there's principalities and we don't all have the same levels of anointing so anyways what makes them go
55:55
is all having to do with a Authority do they see that you have authority over them number one number two do they see
56:00
that you know your authority over them because they can see you have authority but they might try to test you and play
56:06
with you and see if you really know the authority of you have like they might be like um laughing at you and be like no
56:11
you can't cast me out even though they know you have the authority to and they're going to have to obey if you stand strong in your Authority but they
56:18
might try to act so when they see you know your Authority in Christ that's what makes them go like for example when
56:23
you're like yes I do no or yes you must no you must go
56:30
you you must leave I have authority of you you must go like they're like oh great she or he knows their Authority in
56:36
Christ I have to go knows the authority they have knows the anointing they truly
56:41
have and then number three what makes them go is when they see that you um are
56:47
are using your Authority properly they find loopholes when you
56:53
are going outside the laws of authority in the spiritual realm laws of Authority
56:58
for example are number one that you are going with
57:04
people's Free Will you're not going against people's free will because some people want to keep
57:09
their demons and we can't go against their free
57:15
will if that wasn't the case it would mean that there nobody would be demon oppressed in this world but it's because
57:21
people have free will they choose to keep their demons a lot of them a lot of them it's because they choose to keep
57:27
their demons they want their demons they want to do evil they want to
57:32
they like their addiction they like they like their sexual impurity you know they
57:38
like it they don't they don't they don't want Jesus they want to live how they want to live they know what they know what getting rid of their
57:46
demons and giving their lives to Jesus looks like it means that they can't live their selfish way they want
57:53
to live you know so so some people want it some they want they want to keep the deepens um so we can't go against Free
58:00
Will and we um we have to we can't go outside of our
58:07
Authority our Dominion our Dominion or territory we all have different
58:12
dominions and territories for example my dominion and territory is my
58:18
Ministry I can't just knock on the door I can't just show up to this church huge
58:24
mega church or or small Church in La that has no power of God no Deliverance happening I can't just show up before
58:32
their service or in the middle of their service and say the Lord has sent me here because there's so many people who
58:38
are oppressed and I'm just going to quickly deliver them and you can get on with your your message your Ser your
58:44
service but the Lord has sent me here now doesn't work that way the Lord
58:50
wouldn't sent me to do wouldn't sent me to do that because that's going outside of his laws of Dominion and
58:57
territory the people in that church whether big church or small church that Pastor there has dominion over them has
59:05
I mean in the spiritual realm that's their territory it's not my territory if uh if a guest if a pastor
59:13
invites me to speak at their church I then have the the dominion over that service as long as they're obeying the
59:20
spiritual laws like they should it shouldn't be ministers just ministering together
59:26
it should be that Pastor gives me the the authority and so for that hour or
59:32
two hours whatever that they have you know given me the authority to minister over their people um I have the dominion
59:40
over all the demons all the demons have to go uh that's how it's supposed to that's
59:45
how it works in the spiritual R and then so that's that's in terms of ministers but now just in terms of all believers
59:52
you have your own dominion too your Dominion is not your territory is not the church that you attend you can't just be casting out demons however you
59:58
want like at the church that's not your Dominion that's not your territory um we operate biblically like how Apostle
1:00:05
Peter he he came and all he ministered and all were healed and delivered it's
1:00:11
an issue of authority not many people issuing their Authority you know it's
1:00:17
it's the principle of the president issuing a command and that's
1:00:22
what happens that's you don't need a million other people to issue that same
1:00:27
command in the same place that's how it is in the spiritual realm so it's this is the new wine
1:00:34
Revelation also that I'm talking about that many people don't know but this is new wine Revelation this is how to be
1:00:39
the most effective in Deliverance to be the most effective to see demons obeying because you are abiding by the spiritual
1:00:47
laws so when you don't when your eyes are shut to the spiritual laws demons have loopholes they're able
1:00:55
to hide certain places because you are like blinded to how it really works in the
1:01:01
spiritual realm the spiritual laws so
1:01:06
um when for so for a Believer if they were to pray if if if they were to have a conversation with someone and the
1:01:13
person is like opening up to them and then the then you share about Jesus you share how
1:01:19
you've been delivered and this person is like I'm struggling with suicidal thoughts and you're like well God can
1:01:25
deliver you I could pray for you right now do you want me to pray for you and Jesus to deliver you and they say yes so
1:01:32
that's free will that's been happening that's free will and this is just in
1:01:38
whether it's in the grocery store or on the street or in your workplace or
1:01:44
wherever a neutral place like not in the church service where there's already someone's Dominion there but you're just
1:01:50
out in the world somewhere in a neutral space that becomes your Dominion because
1:01:56
that person has opened up to you this person wants Jesus this person wants
1:02:02
Deliverance you haven't been forceful it's important to not be forceful you need Deliverance I'm going to cast The Demon out of you right now no that's
1:02:08
going against Free Will that's not your Dominion because that person's not coming stepping into your space for you
1:02:14
to pray for them for you to use your Authority in Christ over them they don't want your Authority in Christ over them so they have to have um they have to
1:02:20
desire it they have to open up um and then that would be the proper time once
1:02:27
they are open to receiving prayer to then command the demon to go and now you are abiding by all the spiritual laws
1:02:35
and so now the demons the demons have to obey as long as you have enough
1:02:42
anointing like a because there's different measures of anointing um sometimes you need to bring
1:02:49
them to the church where you're planted where I mean where there's really anointing higher level anointing so that
1:02:54
they can receive higher level anointing to deal with higher level demons it's a long topic so go into I did a really
1:03:01
quick summary but please go it's a very in-depth teaching so please go to those
1:03:08
messages that I just shared on my YouTube thoughts on confessing sin among
1:03:15
brothers and sisters yeah well
1:03:23
um in the form of of test testimony is really good that's what testimonies are
1:03:29
confessing you know how you used to be sins you used to have since he used to
1:03:34
do um it's important that we don't become religious about it and be like Catholic in a Catholic way about it you
1:03:41
know um what's so important is our hearts before God and confessing before
1:03:48
God and repenting before God and um you know being open to publicly renounce
1:03:55
such is like church where the anointing is moving you know just to be open to to
1:04:00
confess to renounce publicly there as well [Music]
1:04:06
um it it's not something that needs to be done religiously it's not something that needs to like oh I made a mistake I
1:04:11
need to go and and confess this to my brother and sister it doesn't need to be it's important to not be done
1:04:17
religiously but um in the most the greatest way of doing this would be in
1:04:22
the form of of testimony um you know where you've it's not just
1:04:29
confessing like looking to the brother and sisters like looking to the power of confession to the brother and sister to bring the freedom but understanding it's
1:04:36
the anointing that destroys the Yoke it's surrendering to God and it's the anointing that destroys the Yoke so
1:04:42
understanding this is how the freedom is taking place rather than looking for a religious ritual um to to bring the
1:04:51
Deliverance um that's the important part about it
1:04:56
uh and then to to with the holy spirit's leading naturally you know can share
1:05:01
testimony can share about the the the past or even if it was just yesterday
1:05:07
deciding to repent and renounce and not do this anymore before God to share that testimony is is great you know with the
1:05:14
Holy Spirit lead not to be done religiously and not doesn't have to be with everyone but um with the holy
1:05:20
spirit's leading and I also want to add it's just so important like um an
1:05:26
important part of being planted is to really be grounded in the word that's
1:05:33
coming forth at the place you are planted um like what God is speaking is
1:05:40
really what he wants you to focus on and it's so so important we really humble ourselves and not try to become our own
1:05:49
teachers or um focus on things out so much outside of what what's being taught
1:05:56
of what's being released um that's just a sneaky way the enemy can come and bring distraction and
1:06:03
try to um take your eyes off of the important teachings that are coming
1:06:09
forth each week so uh so yeah so even though there's so many topics in the
1:06:14
Bible so many different subjects it's important that we really stay focused on what is being released where we are
1:06:21
planted each week um rather than uh think of other things and focusing on
1:06:28
other um Revelations so much and like maybe creating own a new doctrine or
1:06:35
something it's so important you just stay grounded you stay planted you stay
1:06:40
focused on on the word of God that's coming forth where you're planted amen
1:06:47
because without that it's like an open door for um for old wine to creep in for
1:06:55
religion to creep in that's why it's very important in this new wine I wanted to clear over all of you
1:07:03
right now thank you Jesus for your power your anointing your new wine your
1:07:09
Revelation that you have released today your direction thank you Jesus thank you
