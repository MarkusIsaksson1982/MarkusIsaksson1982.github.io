What is a healthy relationship to food
0:00
what does a healthy relationship to food look like
0:06
so we should look at Food well food is an important part of our Lives it's a
0:11
it's not just a daily part of our Lives it's a multiple times a day important
0:16
part of our Lives it's it's vital for us to function to survive first of all to
0:23
function well to have energy and also to be healthy because if you eat the wrong
0:28
Foods you could destroy your body you could shed years off of your life just
0:34
from eating the wrong food so it's definitely spiritual to talk about food
0:40
because it affects number one your ability to fulfill your purpose on this
0:45
Earth and number two it affects your ability to be able to take care of your
0:51
temple the Holy Spirit lives in your body and your body is a temple of the
0:56
holy spirit so it's whenever you're taking care of your body whether it's um
1:01
getting good sleep drinking enough water eating the right food and getting
1:07
exercise you really should see it this way as if it's a physical house that you
1:13
live in where Jes where the Holy Spirit lives in too where it's your job to make
1:20
sure the house is clean and um updated and kept in good shape and that the Holy
1:29
Spirit would would be at peace and feel happy to be staying in your
1:34
house and this is every day so um you know what a house like you can clean it one day but
1:42
then you got to upkeep it it's got to be something continually that you're doing that you're making the intention to take
1:50
care of keep up to date don't get behind on so that's how you should see taking
1:56
care of your temple so when it comes to food your relationship with with food
2:02
um you should food is meant to nourish you sustain you um and help your body do
2:11
everything that it needs to do for God that's how you should see food so you should make wise decisions with what you
2:18
put in your body so when you are choosing what to eat it's important for you to to to make good choices to be
2:26
eating nutritional food now it doesn't mean that you have to be confined to
2:31
only eating salads or only eating food that doesn't have any kind of fats or sugars all the time it doesn't mean that
2:39
but it should be a majority of the time most of the time all the choices you're
2:44
making with what you put on your body is it's healthy okay you don't need to be um so
2:53
strict that you can never not have sugar never not have something with fat in it and or grease
3:00
or something you you don't have to to be that way that's not like you don't need to feel guilty you don't need to feel
3:07
religious but it's about moderation it's about moderation um so that's what the
3:14
relationship would should be like you know you should see food as an important
3:20
choice you're making every time you're making a choice to to to put food in your body this is this should be a wise
3:27
choice that that has an impact on your life and has an impact on you being able to please God and serve him the best you
3:35
can you also shouldn't be obsessed about it you shouldn't be obsessed with a certain diet you shouldn't um put too
3:42
much attention anytime you're putting like too much attention somewhere that it's taking your focus off of Jesus off
3:49
of what he's called you to do that's where you know you've gone too far in um
3:55
the attention the obsession the focus you're putting somewhere else
4:01
that being said there will be times where we um have a time to learn about things maybe you never thought about
4:07
this can happen with taking care of your skin this can be there's different seasons with like taking care of different parts of your body where you
4:13
never like learned about it you never learned the right way to take care of your body really so you start
4:20
researching that's that's cool sometimes you need to learn sometimes you need to take time so um but but but we we need
4:28
to make sure we're not getting like too obsessed with um any of those areas I
4:35
know we are not supposed to fear except fear God what was Paul meaning when he said I came to you in weakness and fear
4:40
with much trembling so whenever you look at scripture and you're trying to discern what is it talking about you
4:46
need to look at the context so the context of this of the scripture I don't have the scripture in front of me but I know what scripture you're talking about
4:53
but so I'm going to summarize it and put it kind of a little bit in my own words but it's pretty much exactly what he's
4:58
saying I think I can recall it he says to you he says um I came to you in weakness with
5:06
fear and trembling um for I didn't I I only knew about Christ crucified that's
5:14
what I shared with you and I didn't come to you with wise and persuasive words but I came to you with the demonstration
5:19
of the power of God so that your faith would not rest on my man's word my word
5:24
for it but on God's power so um
5:30
the context of this is showing this is all about Jesus this is
5:36
all about his power when I speak on behalf of God you're not supposed to be
5:43
like I'm not trying to come and impress you with my words um actually let me
5:48
humble myself before you and tell you that I I I I feel so inadequate to be
5:55
used by God in a humble way I have the fear of God you know um Paul remember Paul's past
6:03
remember Paul's past how he was murdering Believers the the most passionate
6:09
zealous one to stop the work of Jesus and now God has redeemed him saved him
6:15
and called him to be this powerful Apostle vessel of him so
6:20
um so he's coming in this place of such humility and such fear of God and like
6:27
oh now I'm coming to speak on half of God to his people and like I I I he's
6:33
coming like I take such seriousness about this word that I'm delivering um and I just want to get out of the way
6:39
and let God be glorified I I I want them to have an encounter with God so that
6:46
that's the the the the the core of what he is speaking
6:52
is he's he's like I don't want to be in the way with with how I speak with with
6:57
my fancy communication skills or something like like that but I'm I I'm not worthy to be a servant of God um I
7:06
am not this great orator and this wildly
7:11
qualified person I come to you with trembling so it's more it's more
7:17
speaking about humility it's not speaking about fear like I'm afraid to speak right now I have anxiety he's not
7:24
that's not what he means he's speaking more of the fear of God and humility so
7:30
he's just just so humbled now that God would use him and so he's he's coming
7:37
showing his humility to the people and um being truthful and honest you know
7:44
this isn't about me this is about Jesus and I'm only able to speak right now
7:50
because of God's power this is God's power you guys are encountering it's not having anything to do with how great I
7:58
am the eny tells me what I do around the house as a stay-at-home wife with no children
How do I get my husband to stop rejecting me
8:04
around doesn't matter it's not that important I know it's not true I keep
8:10
rejecting him how do I get him to stop well first of all Tina I just want
8:16
to say something prophetically to you right now and I just want to say that you I've seen you um just
8:24
testify share your testimony again and again Time After Time time I've shared
8:31
it to my story and so it's reached a lot of people your testimony like the Samaritan woman at the well I've seen
8:37
you show honor I've seen you show honor so much to God's servants I've seen you
8:43
show honor to my spiritual father and I recognize you you showed honor to my
8:49
spiritual father um a long time ago like when there was so much persecution
8:55
happening towards my spiritual father and towards me um you were were one of
9:01
the few who in this time where it was not popular to show honor were honors do
9:08
not popular to show honor to my spiritual father for example you were doing that and I felt
9:16
God's heart towards you of just being so proud of you and I I saw you as a leader
9:23
in this revival in This Global Revival you know leaders are are not just the
9:30
ones with huge platforms and ones who are the ministers and speaking with a
9:37
microphone um and Performing all the Miracles you know leaders are like the
9:43
disciples who were with Jesus like the woman who supported the ministry of Jesus contributed to the ministry of
9:50
Jesus you know their their their names are written their names like Joanna was
9:56
one of them in the Bible I read it this past Sunday but their names were written meaning they were leaders and but but
10:03
but we don't see any record of of them like performing all these Miracles and
10:09
um being an anointed a prophet or something um but but we see their names
10:15
written and we see that because of what they did that active leadership uh Jesus was able to minister
10:22
from from City to city and so many people were able to be touched we see the Samaritan woman at the well how she
10:30
we see her written her story written so she is a leader because her story is
10:35
written in the Bible and she after she encountered the power of God the love of
10:42
God through Jesus Through the prophetic Ministry she had this shameful past and
10:48
Jesus showed love to her regardless and revealed that he knew about her what what was going on her promiscuous ways
10:56
and everything and she unashamedly share the testimony of her Encounter With
11:02
Jesus with so many people and the Bible says that so many believed in Jesus because of because of her because she
11:10
shared her testimony so she is a leader all right the disciples even before they
11:16
became these Apostles walking in signs wonders and miracles they were leaders
11:24
because of those disciples yes because they were contributing to the work of of God through service to Jesus Through um
11:33
any way they were leaders they were massive leaders before the book of Acts be when
11:42
they just their Yes to God and helping Jesus assisting Jesus serving Jesus so
11:47
the work of God could Advance made them great leaders so anyways I say all that to say is that um you doing something
11:55
that is probably seen might have been seen as something so small to you was very big in God's eyes was very big in
12:02
my eyes I remember even like I remember even I was like in an airport like in Europe somewhere like
12:09
a year and a half two years ago when I saw one significant post that you had really honored my spiritual father and
12:15
it really touched my heart like I literally remember the moment of seeing that because it I mean I just want you
12:21
to know the gravity in the spiritual realm how big it is in the spiritual realm um you know just simply showing
12:28
honor where honor is due like you have and sharing your testimonies so um I
12:34
want to encourage you right now and share this just this prophetically because that makes the devil really mad
12:42
and so the devil always wants to try to um try to distract or um stifle one's
12:50
light when they are doing great things for the kingdom when they are shining so
12:55
brightly and so of course the enemy would come in the area that's the exact
13:01
lie the truth is you you've done and you're doing such powerful things for the kingdom of God and so he's
13:07
completely lying um completely lying he's such a liar so he's defeated today
13:13
so may you be encouraged just know that he only attacks in like he will he
13:19
attacks he attacks those who are doing powerful things for the Kingdom so be
13:24
encouraged and um to get him to stop as you said you you have to choose to
13:31
believe the truth don't don't believe his don't give him one inch like don't
13:36
believe his lies even a tiny tiny bit you recognize that lie and then you
13:42
immediately reject it you can speak it aloud I reject that lie um and you can
13:47
confess this truth you know um I am serving Jesus and God is using me for
13:53
his glory and I am doing powerful things in the kingdom of God am fulfilling my
14:00
purpose in jesus' name you just confess it you reject those lies and the pr the
14:07
the principle in the Bible is true it cannot fail that when you submit to God resist the devil he must flee he has to
14:15
fle Hallelujah praise God how to see and
How to see and understand the schemes of the devil
14:21
understand the schemes of the devil with your spiritual eyes without meditating too much on them and being filled with
14:27
Darkness first first of all I want to say this this is like such a powerful
14:33
word God is releasing this year and this this moment this year of um promises
14:39
being fulfilled when you obey Jesus when you
14:46
Sur when you are living surrender to Jesus the devil can never win the devil
14:52
can never win he can never win and this re revation has just grown
15:00
in me so much and so I just want to say I just want to say as your leader I just
15:06
want to um just speak the word of God to you
15:12
with this full of anointing you will always have Victory
15:18
through Christ always as long as you are are
15:23
surrendered and obedient to him and don't have doors open you will always
15:28
have victory the devil can never win he can never win and I I truly speak this
15:35
with so much confidence because you know I've seen so many times where I've seen and I I know I've shared
15:42
this a lot lately this is definitely a message that God's speaking but I'll say it again I've seen many times when it
15:48
seemed like the devil won just like how it did when Joseph's ended up in the pit
15:55
and then ended up sold to slavery and then ended up in prison but the devil was never winning
16:04
he didn't win one of those times these were just things that God allowed for the ultimate Victory to come
The ultimate victory
16:12
the victory of a servant of God being able to be walking in their purpose
16:19
transformed into Christ in the image of Christ like so much into the image of
16:24
Christ and so strong spiritual that they're able to resist all the Temptations of
16:32
the devil that when they get into this place of elevation for God's glory walking in their F their their fullness
16:40
of their calling the devil can't tempt them with
16:46
anything the devil can't tempt them with anything so all these refining fire
16:53
moments that feel like the devil's winning in certain areas in life because they're Valley moments
16:59
they're it's all it's like that boot camp that's hard it's like the the the
17:05
crossing the finish line and getting the gold medal that's the mountain top but
17:11
to get to the mountain top you need to go through the valleys of intense
17:17
training for um an an army to win the war they've got to go through boot camp
17:25
before you have the victory of win the War and Peace time
17:31
coming and the goals accomplished of protecting the people and the
17:37
land so um so much of the time people are not seeing it right they're seeing
17:44
they're fighting the boot camp they're fighting the training like oh Devil's winning this is hard when they're in the
17:51
boot camp or when they're in the training but no that's not it at all
17:57
this is you winning you doing this you going through this hard thing you shedding all this sweat and your muscles
18:05
being sore and getting some scrapes scrapes and bruises along the way that is your
18:12
Victory because that's making that's the only thing that makes you strong to have the ultimate Victory and walk in that
18:20
Victory once you cross the finish line and maintain that that um that victory
18:26
of just walking in your calling Devil's trying to still tempt you with things but he can't get he can't get to
18:32
you you know so um how to see and understand the schemes of the devil with
18:38
your spiritual eyes without meditating too much on them and being filled with Darkness so that's the question so what I just shared is the biggest part you
18:46
know so it's like you know I share with you a lot I teach you I equip you with different
18:51
schemes like this is a scheme of the devil the devil was wants to try to come in this way you got to be aware you got to be aware of your time in the
18:57
wilderness of testing you got to be aware of this you got to be aware of this so but we shouldn't be
19:03
like I got to always be on edge I got to be paranoid all the time no it it's it's
19:09
it's literally just me handing you the battle plan the battle plan of the
19:15
devil so um or God handing you the battle plan like through me and not just
19:20
through me as you read the word of God and God speaks to you but a lot through me I mean Through Your Leader through your teacher if I'm Your Leader um it's
19:28
like here here's the battle plan okay so be aware he's going to try to come here be aware of this and so you just walk
19:34
each day okay here's the battle plan and you study the battle plan okay yeah yeah so oh got it we got this we got this you
19:40
know so so it's really just um being smart being wise and having your eyes
19:46
open but just you know you walk in that confidence like oh I know the battle
19:52
plan and I'm taking this seriously I'm not taking this casually taking it lightly so therefore Devil's never going
19:58
to win I know he's going to do this I know he's going to do this and I know what to do to defeat him when he tries to come like this and like this that's
20:05
the kind of um mindset you got to have that's that's
20:11
how we should walk as Believers that's the mindset of a champion a mindset of one of one who is
20:17
more than a conqueror so you're serious innocent as a dove wise as a serpent you're serious but you're not concerned
20:26
or worried or paranoid uh no you're serious it's like we we we
20:33
got a serious job to do we got a serious job of obeying God carrying out his
Do daily surrender become second nature
20:39
assignment every day and some days are easier than others some days is more work than others sometimes you got to go
20:46
through things that are not fun um but through all of it it's victory and through all of it it isn't heavy because
20:54
God Is With Us carrying the weight helping us
21:00
Hallelujah does the daily surrender become second nature as we grow in the
21:06
anointing absolutely become um becoming more Christlike it will it you literally
21:13
become more Christlike uh you're not faking it you're not acting it it it becomes you
21:22
so it starts out when you first become a Believer or
21:29
maybe you've been a Believer for a long time but you were lukewarm and you never took it serious living in surrender or
21:37
maybe you've never been equipped like in the new wine to know what it really
21:43
means to obey God to surrender to God to serve him okay
21:48
so when you start out when you start out whether it's any of these things any of these instances
21:56
um you you you you you have the Holy Spirit in you and you have a spirit man
22:04
which is the real you which is what came alive when you gave your life to
22:10
Jesus and that Spirit the real you which
22:15
is the spirit we're not talking about the soul or the body but the spirit that's what lives eternally goes to
22:22
heaven with Jesus you also have a soul which is your mind your will and your emotions and you
22:28
live in a physical body so when your spirit Comes Alive it is
22:35
100% pure righteousness good it's one with the Holy Spirit it the the SP
22:41
because when you when you make the decision I want to give my life to Jesus that like Authority you're giving
22:51
Jesus sees that as that's that's you that's the real you not the you that an
22:57
hour later has a temptation to do something worldly like when you give your life to Jesus
23:03
when you make that decision God sees that as the real you
23:09
God understands and knows that you've been in the world you've been influenced by the
23:14
world and that influence of the world that influence from the enemy has become
23:19
a part of you so like God understands that so when you say I give my life to
23:27
Jesus that's the real you God sees and then he makes your spirit man come alive and
23:33
then your spirit man that's the real you that's the one that's saying I give my life to Jesus I make the decision to
23:38
give my life to Jesus that Spirit man is always that and so like a lot of people when they first give their life to
23:46
Jesus it's different for everybody but like I mean they they'll ha that that
23:52
that person will have this inclination I want to go to church I want to read the Bible I want to live Godly they'll have
24:00
that inclination some of the time depending on the person maybe most of the time maybe just a little bit of the time or just some of the time but that
24:07
person will have that inclination that desire that's your spirit man that can't
24:13
happen without you coming alive and becoming like Jesus um and and and and
24:19
that's that's that's the real you so um but then like most people when
24:25
they first give their life to Jesus especially if they're not where the power of God is to really deliver them help them clean them mold them help them
24:33
get the junk of the world out you know when they don't when people don't have that it's this battle all the time it's
24:39
like they have this they're like two different people they have this inclination this desire for the things of God but then half the time or
24:46
whatever percentage of the time they have such a strong inclination and desire to do things in the world it's
24:51
like really conflicting what that is is your soul that has not been trans your soul which is your mind your will and
24:57
your emotions which not been transformed by God at all yet it becomes transformed
25:03
by God when you make the decision when you make the intention okay so you that's why there's like this battle
25:08
because it's your spirit versus your soul and your body is is is really
25:15
following the soul a lot of the time most of the time too so your body meaning like your soul
25:22
I don't know wants to um wants to drink wants to do drugs or wants to get angry
25:28
and lash out and um wants to be prideful
25:34
and egocentric and um do something selfish and um and so then the body then
25:40
does those things does what the soul is Desiring so
25:47
um what makes what the what the goal what what God wants what what what what
25:53
we want what God wants is for the soul and the body to to come in line with the
26:00
spirit to so the whole you is matching the spirit so at first sometimes the
Make the decision to obey God
26:07
spirit is like small we need the spirit to be strong we need the spirit to take
26:13
over to take over every so that's when you be when you're becoming transformed more more into the image of God that's
26:19
what's happening it's your spirit being small and then like there's the soul the
26:25
M the mind it's like and if you think of your body it's like Soul your mind your will your emotions which are influenced
26:31
by the enemy so much in the world because that that's how it was before Jesus just influenced by the world so much it's taking up all this space in
26:38
you and then you have your spirit is is Tiny is Tiny so the more you make the
26:44
decision to serve God to obey God you follow his commands and and that's a lot
26:50
of the times going to be not you're not feeling like doing it but you make the decision that's that's the Bible says
26:56
deny your flesh that's the action of denying your flesh you don't feel like doing these things of God you don't feel
27:02
like reading the word you don't feel like going to church you don't feel like um applying what the word of God is saying to do you don't feel like
27:08
applying what the what your spiritual leader has has taught you don't feel
27:13
like that but you make the choice to do it whenever you make that choice to do it it's like your spirit grows a little
27:20
bit your and your soul your mind emotions that were big is like suppressed is is is denied is is pushed
27:25
down well it's God's power is helping that happen so when you make that intention when you make when you give
27:32
it's a giving God the authority change me Lord God I give you the authority to
27:38
make my spirit take over to to to make the soul the the the the mind the will
27:45
and the emotions that are so influenced by the enemy in the world to be get it get it out get it out get it out get it
27:51
out let my mind my will and my emotions match yours God and make my body to
27:58
match yours like like make my body everything I do be to glorify you
28:03
everything I do with my body to glorify you um so when you make that choice okay
28:10
I'm doing what God is saying to do when you do that that's the action of
28:16
receiving God's help accessing God's help so God in his power does something Supernatural and um makes you more
28:23
spiritual that's simply what takes place that's simply what takes place so so day by day you make the
Transformation
28:30
decision the intention to do what God is saying to do
28:37
do what God wants what's pleasing to God every day you do that and all many times
28:43
throughout the day that you're doing that you become transformed more into God's image every time so that adds up
28:51
so over time over time you literally become complete so so trans Med so
28:58
transformed that you have no desire for the things of the world and you'll see people who are lukewarm and you're like
29:04
why do you want to do that I don't understand even though that used to be you but you're so transformed that you
29:11
don't you can't you can't get it you're like what you're so different you're so
29:18
transformed and so then you're just flowing with the Holy Spirit you're not
29:23
having things hold you back you're able to hear his voice more you're able to be more sensitive to his Spirit you're able
29:29
to walk in wisdom more because not everything is God what do I do here God what do I do here God what do I do here
29:34
many times it's walking in wisdom using wisdom using what he's already learned you and that that's how you already know
29:40
the choice to make it's already in you you are because you're so much like you're you have the mind of Christ
29:45
you're thinking like God you know like how do I treat this person in this situation you know H how should I speak
29:53
with them talk with them show an action to them you don't have to be like excuse me person I got to pray about it God
30:00
what do I do with this situation you know there's times where you need to use wisdom and do what God would want you to
30:07
do wants you to do using your mind of Christ that's been transformed trans transformed in you
30:15
Hallelujah so um yes you eventually day after day of
30:22
doing this it's natural surrender it it's it's not
30:29
something difficult it's just natural it's natural and then of course there'll be like testing times where it becomes
30:36
more difficult to surrender to God on one day when he takes you through something that you've never gone through before um asking you to do something
30:44
that's hard that you haven't ever had to do before that will still come but even when that
30:50
comes you still it's just it's like of course I must I must serve God okay this is going to be difficult this is
30:56
something new but there's nothing pulling you from the world like come on do this there's not
31:02
there's not the devil on your shoulder anymore no he he doesn't get to be there
31:08
anymore because of what you have done it's a reward I mean your choice to
31:14
serve god with your life has evicted the devil from being on
31:20
your shoulder from really being this seducing
31:25
voice that you kind of want to follow sometimes it's it he's he can't be there
31:32
and even if he tried to be there you it you doesn't have any hold on you doesn't
31:37
have any Sway and this is what I speak from my experience praise
31:43
God in this new wine it's a new move that God is bringing and it's rare
31:51
there's a lot of people who do not have the revelation of this of the new wine
31:57
and 's a lot of religion out there so you it's the most wise thing to do is to
32:03
remain planted which means to be focused on the teachings of where you are being
32:10
planted this is very serious for right now's time right now because because of
32:17
this move of God we are in okay so if you know you need to recognize where you
32:23
have received the place where you have received so much stick to there you know
32:30
because other there's other things there's there's many places that don't have the power of God and have a lot of
32:37
religion and religion is harmful the old wine is harmful if you want to learn more about the old wine versus the new
32:43
wine go to my um YouTube and on the
32:48
Revival army training playlist there is some teachings several teachings a
32:54
series about the new wine um you can also just search like Catherine cck new
32:59
wine and I think there's a lot of sub uh titles on my YouTube
33:05
but definitely listen to those so you can have really that understanding of the seriousness of not mixing old wine
33:13
religion these things the things that wouldn't help save deliver
33:19
people um but would hold them back religion keeps people from knowing God's
33:26
love it keeps people from being in true relationship with God it it keeps people
33:32
from being truly pure and humble in heart it's it's it's not good so it's
33:38
very important where you have received from where you really have received there's fruits there stay with the
33:44
fruits because when you try to mix in other other things it pollutes it contaminates the purity of what you've
33:51
received so you need to really walk in that wisdom of sticking to what has
33:57
worked work sticking to where you really encounter Jesus you don't get itching
34:02
ears don't try to do too many things that ends up over complicating things and ends up bringing harm when it comes
34:10
to the things of the kingdom it needs to be simple it needs to be simple um by
34:17
that I mean stay planted the Simplicity of being planted there's more than enough
34:24
teachings where you're being where you're planted more than enough so many so make sure you're focusing on
34:32
where you are planted because if you're not fully focusing there you're missing out on the essential spiritual nutrients
34:38
you need to nourish you to protect
34:43
you to guide you and what God is doing in this in
34:48
this season right now and for example at five-fold church instead of Bible studies we have live streams but this is
34:55
this is to reach more people I could do this and I could I mean well for one
35:01
it's for one it's not the season to have multiple Services yet and for one that would that would mean several several
35:08
several SE several thousands more dollars per week to have another service but it's so it will be God's timing when
35:14
doors open up and when it's just simply God's timing to have multiple in-person services so but like I could at my home
35:21
I could or not my home but I don't somewhere we could go and have a in-person Bible study but I might have
35:27
to limit it to the amount of people that could fit in that space so this is bible study this is this is
35:35
you know we don't need to do things the old traditional way we can it's important to do to to adapt with God to
35:43
to adapt with the Holy Spirit to move with the new thing that God is doing this is what will really help
35:49
you where I live there's very limited new wine being revealed and it makes us walk lonely at times you know it is part
Loneliness
35:56
of the Cross we bear you know it's it's it's not always it's not every
36:02
aspect of the will of God is fun but it's the best and there's different seasons there's different seasons that
36:10
that there's more fun Seasons there's Seasons where maybe they feel more lonely but those are times that where we
36:16
get to lean more into Jesus than ever before and become closer to him whenever
36:21
you sense a feeling of loneliness you should know this is a time that God wants me he's he's he's he's removed
36:28
people out of my life so I can spend more time with him this is a gift and I Will Not Waste this season be encouraged
36:35
you're not alone and there's a family around the world of many many people
36:41
millions of people that are in this revival Army in this new wine so we are
36:47
together we are not alone we are together and I thank God for times where we can really gather together like in
36:53
these live streams we are together this is beautiful than about think of this right now there's almost a hundred of us
37:01
here right now and we are all in one Accord we are all United we are all on the same page we are all doing the same
37:08
purpose on this Earth we are all United in this what God has called us to do carrying out this assignment of being
37:13
vessels of God to bring his Revival to bring his power to bring his new wine to
37:19
bring hope to the oppressed and the lost to bring freedom to the captives to open
37:25
up the eyes of the blind this is exciting work that we're doing and it's such a blessing that we we do indeed
37:32
have each other we're doing it together hallelujah
37:38
amen and I thank God you know we we I'm grateful that we live in this time if we
37:43
lived like I mean it's so recent too just 20 years
37:49
ago 20 years ago we couldn't do this most of us were alive 20 years ago most
37:56
of us here right now were alive 20 years ago and we couldn't be doing this right now and
38:02
so it's it's a blessing how God has given us this gift this tool that we
38:09
can be United together like this amen and have true family across the
38:18
world how to know and be sure if God is leading me to be planted so where there
Fruits of the Holy Spirit
38:24
is the real power of God that has touched you and changed you where there
38:30
are fruits of the Holy Spirit where leadership is exhibiting these fruits that you can see the fruits of the Holy
38:36
Spirit especially the the the the fruits that are that are rare pretty rare in
38:41
the church today in leadership humility Purity true love of God
38:48
selflessness seeing those fruits and also the fruits of Jesus's Ministry healing Deliverance Miracles these
38:54
things should be taking place where you are are planted when you are finding you are
39:00
being brought closer to Jesus and becoming more spiritual having your eyes opened up more in the spiritual realm
39:06
being equipped for victory over the devil through the teachings of this
39:11
ministry these are all signs of God speaking this is where you are called to be planted now there's more than one
39:18
anointed Ministry out there so if if it's like well this ministry is Anointed this ministry is Anointed where where do
39:25
I choose well number one where have you found yourself growing more if you're if
39:31
you're like looking at both you know receiving from both where have you found yourself growing more and also where is
39:38
the holy spirit speaking to you um a lot of it's having to do with your purpose
39:44
the vision of the ministry the work of God going forth I if your spirit is
39:50
leaping with what's happening with the work that's going forth that's a sign that this is it's like um Elizabeth in
39:57
her womb the baby John the Baptist weeped in her in her womb when when she
40:04
saw Mary who who who who who was pregnant
40:09
with Jesus so there was this leaping it was this wow this is what I'm called to too
40:16
wow I'm so excited to this is this is why I'm here this is my
40:22
purpose this is lighting me up this is what I was made to do you know you know
40:27
um that kind of thing will happen holy spirit will speak to you A lot of it will be through wisdom wisdom
40:35
is like how I how I just shared look at the fruits what are the fruits are the
40:40
fruits there have you experienced the fruits in your own life so that's all having to do with wisdom that's not
40:45
having to do with God speak to me in AUD Audible Voice that's all having to do with wisdom so a lot of it's just simply
40:52
wisdom and God's speaking through that you using wisdom and then number two it
40:58
will also be the the still Small Voice many times of the Holy Spirit speaking May for others it could be God sending a
41:04
dream as well but um there will be that that your spirit resonating and
41:11
confirming can I get delivered from a Ministry where only like healing takes place and not much Deliverance you shall
41:18
know them by their fruits but let me also apply that principle that's having to do with true prophets versus false prophets but I also want to want to
41:25
share like Revelation just in terms of like you'll know what you'll receive by the
41:30
fruits you know like um when you see testimonies when you hear testimonies of
41:36
things happening at a minist at a ministry that's fruits you can eat
41:42
yourself because a minist a true Ministry is for the people a true Ministry is like
41:49
um if you it's like a field of fruits
41:55
vegetables uh that are there for you to freely eat you don't have to do anything
42:01
for them you don't have to pay for them they're free from God remember these are gifts that God gave to the church the
42:07
body of Christ Ephesians 4:11 Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers these are speaking of leadership of the church so when when in
42:14
Ephesians 4 it's really speaking about the church the church because these are the leaders so the church is a gift of
42:21
Apostles prophets evangelist pastors teachers the leadership the the the the
42:26
the vessels that are releasing the things of God the the the the spiritual things spiritual gifts um
42:33
in the church that's gifts so there's this gift of like a a field of all these
42:41
different fruits and vegetables and everything that you need for your spiritual Life Deliverance healing
42:49
anointed teachings um prophetic words prophetic
42:54
directions that will open up your eyes uh a covering of protection over you in
42:59
the spiritual realm um correction guidance um so discipleship
43:08
okay so it's like you're coming to eat these fruits so um we share testimonies
43:14
when you when you see testimonies when you read testimonies when you hear testimonies that's how you can know oh they have that kind of fruit there and
43:21
most in every Church we're we're not there yet we're in the beginning stages but we're getting to the place where
43:26
every true church like where every leader is truly surrendered to God and truly wants God to have his way in the
43:33
church they will have the anointing that destroys yolks to cast out demons the
43:39
anointing to heal the sick and the anointing that delivers the word of God the true word of God the word that
43:46
brings revelation of God's written word um and the prophetic word of God the now
43:54
word of God uh we're getting there we're not there yet okay and so how that will
44:01
take place is when every um leader of every church will surrender now not
44:06
every leader will surrender some will stay in Pride okay so we have to be aware of that not be foolish um children
44:14
of God we have to be aware that there will be some that will stay in Pride and they won't receive the anointing and
44:20
they won't have the all those nice beautiful fruits array of fruits like a rainbow of fruits in their Church
44:25
they'll just have one kind of fruit or two kinds of fruits all right and so um what you see is what you get okay
44:34
so if you're seeing people being delivered of all types of things you can know woo not really nothing's impossible
44:41
here you know and you can start you can really have that faith of okay I haven't even heard of this testimony of
44:46
something being delivered of this yet but there's a whole big array of so many different things people are going to be
44:51
delivered of so this is truly fruit I can tell of the acts Church where all
44:58
sicknesses were healed where truly nothing was impossible for those Apostles for those disciples as God says
45:07
and truly they were doing the things greater than God even because Jesus says you'll do the things I do and
45:13
greater so when it's starting to look like the acts Church in this ministry you can you can expect the fruits of the
45:20
acts church you can you can go with faith knowing I I know I I know God will touch me and deliver me and heal me of
45:25
any kind of thing here because this is the fruit that I've seen But if you have only seen healing there if You' only
45:30
heard testimonies it doesn't mean that God's limited there God absolutely can't deliver someone there doesn't mean that
45:36
but it's a good indication that there is a lack of anointing there is not if
45:42
there is anointing there's not a high level anointing that can deal with demons that can destroy yolks that that
45:49
that because it's the anointing that makes demons uncomfortable start to manifest and be
45:57
sent out they have to obey and there's there's the the that's the authority
46:02
that the vessel carries the servant of God carries that true Authority makes the demon to obey and then there's also
46:10
the anointing that comes upon them like fire making sure enforces that Authority
46:16
making sure they will obey making sure they cannot try to put
46:21
up a fight you know even if they try to be rude to Authority for example and say no or something
46:27
something it's done they have to obey that Authority they have to go okay so
46:33
if if if if we're not seeing testimonies of Deliverance happening in a ministry that's it's safe to say that there is
46:40
not anointing there well at least a high enough level of anointing that makes
46:47
demons uncomfortable and Obey so um I've G I've
46:54
ministered all over the world I I have to count the countries again I've like lost track I think it's like 14 or
47:01
15 um I've ministered so many places and I
47:06
tell you what I've seen demons manifest every single place and every single service I've
47:12
every single place I've ministered it's been a Christian meeting I haven't come in a
47:17
disguise um saying this is just an inspirational talk it's been advertised
47:22
as a Christian service like so the meaning by that I mean that most people coming are already
47:29
Christians um most people coming are just they're coming because they want to
47:35
receive from Jesus so that's usually mostly Christians right um of course
47:41
there's going to be some who are unsaved but they're invited praise God but they're going to be minorities just like
47:47
every Church in the whole world you know it's it's mostly made up of members of
47:52
the church and they're inviting those who are don't know Jesus yet but those are the minorities so anyways all of
47:59
these places where most of the times the the these people that have been set free most of the time like maybe 99% of the
48:06
time if I had to say a number they're Believers they're believers who were oppressed okay so I know that every
48:16
church every Church there would be demons manifesting most if not every
48:22
Sunday if anointing was truly present so if they're not manifesting and being cast out it means
48:29
there's not the anointing there to destroy the Yoke simply this is why it's so serious for
48:39
the whole body of Christ for leaders in the body of Christ to Simply accept God's move and his anointing because
48:46
without that they're holding back people from the truth and being set free by the
48:52
power of God they're holding back the anointing from coming in their churches
48:57
because God cannot release the anointing to Servants of God I mean to well to people who are ministers if they will
49:05
not humble themselves when you really think about it it's so serious it's it's so serious
Seeing the Light
49:13
it's 911 this is how the whole body of Christ and leaders should see
49:21
it but the more we do our part to shine our light bright those of us in the
49:26
truth and humble and surrendered the
49:32
more we shine our light the more we Testify the more it will make a
49:37
difference the more it will move Hearts it the more it will move Hearts
49:43
to surrender to when people to the kindness of God leads to repentance and
49:49
seeing the light is what will bring that change in people so seeing that light
49:55
convicts seeing the light of humility for example and Purity convicts one they
50:02
still have the choice if they will repent upon that conviction or not but
50:07
it will at least keep a person from
50:13
ignoring what they've been ignoring you know ignoring um that they've been
50:19
prideful or or selfish right when they see humility when they see an example of
50:24
it it's a light shining upon darkness in them that maybe they've chosen to just
50:30
swept under the rug so this is how we can see transformation the most in the whole body of Christ in the area of
50:37
humility in the area of Purity in the area of surrender to God and obedience is by us shining our light right but it
50:44
it's being leaders it's being leaders for people to say oh wow there can be a
50:49
higher standard of purity of humility of surrender and obedience that I haven't
50:54
gone yet I'm convicted to do better to deny my flesh more to
51:02
repent to to to Not Just Surrender and Obey 90% of the time but
51:09
more amen that's my prayer that's that's what gives me
51:18
motivation change is coming it's not it's not for nothing our obedience our surrender
51:26
how do we manage balance our time and energy spent with school activities and
51:34
spending alone time with God while also taking time to be with
51:40
family um so I think number one I just want to say have Grace for yourself because it just as you list all those
Have Grace
51:46
things that's a lot it is um and we only
51:52
have 24 hours in a day so number one have Grace for yourself because I the
51:57
Trap that we get in a trap that many Christians get in is they they see God they see his
52:05
commands or they see what there's being what's being spoken at church or something it's like you got
52:11
to do this you got to do this you got to do this you got to do this you better do all this and then one tries to do it and
52:16
then they can never do it all and then they just feel horrible and shameful and like God's disappointed so when you get
52:24
to that place that in that place it's it's a place of
52:30
hearing the devil's voice of condemnation and it and it will take you farther from God if you remain just like
52:37
in that place of condemnation so that's what's not to do that's why I say first
52:42
of all have Grace for yourself and just know the reality of there's only 24
52:48
hours in a day so you know I'm not going to beat like don't beat yourself up for
52:53
not doing what you simply can't do God certainly not doing that he knows that
52:58
you can't do everything that's being asked of you always right so
53:05
um but God is asking you to do a bunch of things in one day and you
53:11
can do it with him but it's it's just what I'm saying is it's important not to
53:16
like strive for like Perfection like be so hard on yourself if you don't do a
53:22
million things when simply that day maybe you didn't get as much sleep or something or maybe the the homework took
53:29
took longer that day or something came up or a friend needed um you to give
53:35
their ear to them and listen to them and show love to you know like things like that come up and what people many times
53:41
do um not wisely is forget that like God's not like oh well you still have to
53:47
do these things so figure out how you're going to do them God has Grace okay so
53:54
um you you have that's the most important thing okay walk in God's grace
53:59
and just walk without understanding that God God understands God understands um
54:06
you know and so don't be too hard on yourself if everything on the checklist
54:12
doesn't get checked off the best thing you can do is make know that spending
54:17
time with God is priority okay and so try to make a goal
54:24
of half an hour or an hour just depending I'm not going to give you a certain spend this amount of time with
54:30
God Alone per day um because I re we really have to get out of that rigid
54:37
religiousness traditional rituals we really need to make room to
54:42
follow and flow with the holy spirit with the holy spirit's leading it'll look different for each day but if you
54:47
can make a set aside a time I'm spending time with God today you know I'm going to spend time in the word um and
54:55
generally maybe plan to read a chapter of the Bible a day you could or it just depends on the season maybe you want to
55:00
read two chapters a day or maybe you want to just read half a chapter or a quarter of a chapter but really just
55:06
meditate on it a lot you know because you want to make sure you're not just like oh I got to read a chapter oh I want to try to finish the Bible in one
55:12
year so and and and then you're not even really reading the word you're not you're not able to hear God's voice
55:18
because you're doing it in a ritual way okay so um just take the set out the
55:25
time each day to to spend some time with God alone and with the intention of
55:31
showing love to him of hearing his voice of just being intimate with him
55:38
and with the intention of really being in relationship so rather than like okay got to read my Bible and then uh say a
55:45
little prayer to God and then go to bed but but really be a real person have a
55:50
real relationship so maybe you're feeling extra grateful one day so you're just spending most of your time just
55:56
thanking God and counting your blessings and just bringing to remembrance I'm grateful for my parents I'm grateful for
56:03
this person I'm grateful for thank you Lord or maybe one day you're like really
56:09
um you're feeling impatient about the promises you
56:15
know and so this time spend more time um just thanking God for his perfect timing
56:23
thanking God for his promises spend more time um just talking to God confessing Lord I
56:30
trust you I trust you your your ways are perfect I'm grateful that you're in control that you know what you're doing
56:37
this refining fire you're taking me through this whole process thank you Lord so that's how you
56:43
flow that's how you follow the Holy Spirit you know based on what's going on that day follow the Holy Spirit follow his
56:52
leading um maybe sometimes instead of reading the usual chapter a day you you
57:01
go to the the sermon from this past Sunday or sermon from this Wednesday as
57:07
I shared on the live and you write down the scriptures and you meditate on the scriptures and you meditate on the word
57:15
that was released in the sermon because that's the Rama RMA present tense word and you really meditating on them maybe
57:21
that's your time in the word that day all right and so um
57:27
well I'm giving you tips so that it can be um instead of a thing on the a thing
57:33
to check off the on the checklist but a priority and a fun priority an important
57:39
priority a beautiful priority a the priority of your day that's sustaining
57:45
you throughout your day that's sustaining you for the next day that's the source of your peace and joy and
57:50
your ability to do everything else in the rest of the day okay and um also don't put put
57:57
pressure on yourself to to to have to spend like tons of hours with your family
58:04
every day like like be realistic you know like so that you can make
58:10
boundaries it's important to spend time with family but don't feel unnecessary pressure when
58:18
um you what what's needed is to just set up healthy
58:23
boundaries amen Hallelujah and also the most important
58:30
part of um intimacy with God and relationship with God the most important part
58:37
is living with God living with Holy Spirit um because the majority of the
58:45
day you're I mean you have work if you're in school you have school but if
58:50
you're in work you have work for most of the day and then many of you you're cooking or you're spending time with the
58:56
kids you're taking care of the kids you're spending time with the spouse you're you have all these responsibilities
59:02
homework activities so the um and then you spend
59:08
time with God for like half an hour an hour or whatever how time it is but the majority of the day is not that
59:14
concentrated time spending with God so but but you need to make sure you're
59:19
you're you're in relationship with God the whole day so that's why I say like it's the biggest priority is to be
59:25
bringing Holy Spirit with you every part of your day that's because and in that
59:30
way on on a day where just one of those weird days where things come up and
59:35
maybe you fell asleep before you spent time with God or you slept through your alarm or something so you couldn't spend
59:41
your usual time with God and then you fell asleep something just comes up where you didn't have that half an hour
59:49
one hour hour time with God but it's not so detrimental because you were with God
59:55
all day you were included God in your life every day you were bringing to remembrance Renewing Your Mind
1:00:00
scriptures um the word of God um you were um making intention to talk to him
1:00:07
throughout the day to if you're around people you were still like putting your mind to him and including him you know
1:00:15
just like if you are with a a family member or a friend the entire day but
1:00:21
you're like maybe you're not just having this like one-on-one conversation but if you're with them the entire day you're
1:00:27
still like with them you know even if it's not that dedicated oneon-one like
1:00:33
this but you're still talking you're still having intimacy you're still with each other it's like that thank you
1:00:38
Jesus and I want to declare over all of you right now thank you Lord I declare
1:00:45
over all of you right now that any any area of religion old wine
1:00:52
and condemnation and shame any of these things that were holding you back from intimacy with God from
1:01:00
true relationship with God from Walking In God's love and grace and compassion
1:01:07
and mercy I declare these things to be removed and broken off your life now in
1:01:13
jesus' name I declare all heaviness of religion
1:01:20
to come off you now and I impart this
1:01:27
this revelation of God's grace his compassion his love he's so
1:01:34
loving he's so loving you know like how someone's really understanding you
1:01:41
um I don't know if you've ever had someone in your life but or if you can see I hope you can see me in this way as
1:01:48
your leader even if we haven't had one-on-one um conversations or anything
1:01:53
but I don't know if you've had any anyone in your life uh who maybe you were never afraid
1:02:02
to you you felt like they would never judge you or condemn you like that they just had an understanding heart like if
1:02:07
you were to tell them I messed up in this situation or something they wouldn't they would just be
1:02:13
understanding they would be compassionate okay so God is that way but way but way more but way
1:02:22
more um so many people just don't grasp God's compassion and this is what
1:02:30
this is so important you get this that God he understands he has
1:02:35
compassion um he he he knows um he knows that things are
1:02:42
difficult sometimes he knows what you're going through and he's he he this is
1:02:47
part of why he came as 100% man 100% God so that he can really embody that
1:02:55
compassion to you and really demonstrate to you I get you I understand and this
1:03:01
is so important that you that you see your best friend and father and Lord
1:03:08
rightly that he's someone to never be afraid of like he he understands he has
1:03:14
compassion always he has Grace and God wants you to start living in that Grace more God
1:03:20
wants you to start Renewing Your Mind to his grace to his compassion to his Mercy to his
1:03:26
understanding more and part of that is Renewing Your Mind to see how proud he is of you when
1:03:33
you've when you've served him when you've obeyed him when you've done things when you've done things that were hard for him when you chose the narrow
1:03:40
road ah every time he is so proud of you imagine yourself as a parent some of you
1:03:47
are parents some of you are not but if you're not imagine imagine every time
1:03:52
your kid does something that's in obedience to God that's something good
1:03:58
they um blessed somebody they brought a smile to somebody's face they made the right decision they made a difference in
1:04:05
this world Imagine just like the smile that would come on your face and just the great pride and joy you'd feel
1:04:13
that's how God sees you every time you obey him every time you serve
1:04:23
him and you know that's what gives you ability and power
1:04:29
to resist Temptations to serve God every
1:04:34
day is to see him so proud of you cheering you on full of so much joy
1:04:43
because of what you did because you obeyed him it's it's it's it's experiencing his
1:04:51
love being just showered upon you you got to see him rightly you got to renew your mind to this truth you got to
1:04:57
believe this truth it's not too good to be true this is the great love of God if if you can believe that God's love is so
1:05:04
great that he has has has removed your sins and given you eternity in heaven
1:05:10
can't you believe that he's proud of you when you serve him when you obey him can't you choose to renew your mind to
1:05:17
believe this truth I share this because I don't want you to miss out on God's love and I know that such a
1:05:25
the power The Source behind you being able to obey God daily and fulfill your purpose is having to do with remembering
1:05:33
his love Renewing Your Mind to his love seeing his love for you
1:05:39
accurately so may your eyes open up more to God's love for you may you every day see his love and
1:05:48
that's going to be a choice sometimes to renew your mind and choose to believe despite how you feel may you every day
1:05:55
see God's love for you experience God's love for you experience God's God being
1:06:02
proud of you his Delight in
1:06:07
you that's what helps you have the fear of God the fear of God is Not Just oh
1:06:12
God's so big I never want to disappoint him cuz he's God like that's definitely part of it yeah but like even bigger
1:06:20
part of it is this indebtedness this like
1:06:26

1:06:34
get to say thank you to the love you've shown me I get to touch your
1:06:39
heart you know and when I obey you it's it's making in the spiritual realm your
1:06:46
kingdom to advance you your work to go forth more people to be saved he'll Delivered come
1:06:52
to the kingdom like that that's a big part of the of God is just knowing like
1:06:58
the seriousness the the beautiful weight of obeying God I never
1:07:06
want to not please God because how could I not do this how could I not help the kingdom to advance and show love to him
1:07:12
and say thank you how I would never want to not do that it's just that's a big part of the fear of God is just is is
1:07:18
your love for God your love for God Amen so may you grow in this fear of
1:07:26
God love of God this week in jesus' name
