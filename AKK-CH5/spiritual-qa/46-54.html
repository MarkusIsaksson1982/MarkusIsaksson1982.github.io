how to not compare yourself to Brothers and Sisters in Christ so it's good to be inspired it's
0:08
good to be inspired by Brothers and Sisters in Christ in their strength of
0:13
Faith their maturity that's good so to you know look
0:18
and see good fruit and look and see big Faith Purity
0:24
humility that's good you know iron sharpens iron the Bible says so number
0:31
one you will be inspired your faith will be strengthened by those with stronger
0:38
Faith than you at the moment stronger uh more
0:43
humility um more of the fruits of Jesus in terms of leadership in terms of
0:49
leaders in your life your spiritual father or mother but then number two the Bible
0:54
says iron sharpens iron so um there will also be certain fruits of the spirit and
1:02
strengths and godliness in brothers and sisters that you shouldn't turn a blind
1:08
eye to you know you shouldn't just ignore you should look at and be
1:13
inspired and allow that iron to sharpen iron um but at the same time you have to
1:19
make sure you're not comparing as as if like it's a competition there is no
1:26
competition in the kingdom of God we are all on the same team we are all
1:33
on the same team and the Bible talks about this so clearly and several times the Bible talks about how when one part
1:41
of the body is thriving then the rest are thriving then you are thriving when
1:46
one suffers then the other part suffer then you suffer so number one we have to renew our minds
1:53
to this truth it it's it's really not like something easy to remember remember
2:01
um it's it's easier to compare it's easier to forget that we are on the same
2:08
team but really I mean what we are called to do on this Earth is to destroy
2:14
the devil's Kingdom Advance God's kingdom and be the brightest light we can for Jesus and we become the the
2:20
brightest light when we're United and that's the truth and so
2:25
that's what we're called to do on this Earth and so it is really true true when one of our brothers and sisters is
2:32
thriving is succeeding is shining bright um is growing that's nothing but good
2:40
news good news for you personally good news for God good news for the kingdom
2:45
of God so we have to renew our minds as I said this is not this doesn't come natural this isn't easy to just remember
2:53
this you have to renew your mind to this truth and you have to remember like you
2:58
know how one part when one part thrives the rest thrives it's kind of hard
3:03
to like internalize that like like make that connection like how when you
3:10
succeed how does that really affect me that much like you know it's it's kind
3:16
of it's so spiritual it's such a spiritual truth not really like a physical truth it's such a spiritual
3:22
truth um but it's the truth it's simply the truth it's simply the truth that when whatever one of our brothers and
3:29
sisters thrives and succeeds and shines bright it's only good news for us it's
3:35
it's we're on the same team this is a team sport or a team game that we are
3:42
in uh we have to work together we we can't just just one of us thrives you
3:49
know so just one of us shines it doesn't work that way it does not work that way so in teams there are those who have
3:57
different strengths there are leaders there are captains sin but we are all on the same team and we want everyone to
4:04
shine and succeed and grow and be pleasing to God and touch God's heart
4:10
you know we want that and if you don't feel that feeling that's okay but you
4:15
need to renew your mind to this truth I want this I want this for them I want them to shine bright I want them to
4:22
succeed I want good for them and speak it aloud and reject the opposite
4:27
feelings maybe you're having of comparison and of jealousy um number
4:32
two um the grass is always greener on the other side you know the saying like
4:40
um it's it's all it's things aren't always as they appear things are always as they
4:47
appear so that's another reason why we shouldn't like compare because I mean I here here's just an
4:54
example of what I mean um I remember when when my eyes first open up to how
5:00
God moved in power um and I was baptized in the Holy Spirit and I was um just growing closer
5:08
to God like never before and I was just like kind of beginning to really be in relationship with God learning what that
5:15
meant I I be I went to different circles different um
5:21
like uh different churches and um I just was all of a sudden around people who
5:27
I've never been around with people that would talk about their relationship with God and their the visions and dreams and
5:33
encounters they all had you know and um God got and in that moment I would feel
5:41
many times insecure I would feel insecure like what's wrong with me I'm not having
5:46
a vision like they're having I'm not having um these radical like encounters
5:53
I'm not hearing the audible voice of God I'm not seeing Jesus like they're describing um
6:00
and I would feel insecure I would compare and I would think what's wrong with me what am I doing wrong maybe I'm
6:07
just not a good enough Christian maybe I'm not sitting and listening and waiting for God enough I'm really trying
6:13
I'm sitting here for a while in silence I'm really I'm trying but maybe I'm
6:19
missing something you know these types of thoughts would definitely go through my head and um f fast forward fast
6:27
forward to um receiving the prophecy over my life uh that I was called to be
6:33
an apostle um uh uh coming under my my now spiritual father and now learning so
6:41
much like real truth in of the spiritual
6:46
realm and about God from through him through my spiritual father Prophet Dr
6:51
jvy really opened up my eyes to certain things like um number one the reality of
6:57
the angel of Light the real reality that like some people that were saying that
7:04
they were having certain visions and things God revealed to me it wasn't from God you
7:13
know so I'm not saying all I'm not saying all I'm just saying a lot of these areas that I had been comparing
7:19
myself it was doing me no good it was God revealed to me there was nothing
7:24
wrong with me I wasn't missing anything God wasn't wanting to appear in these certain ways that I thought he wanted to
7:31
and so I was I was at that place before thinking I'm not good enough I'm not
7:36
spiritual enough and all these people are so much more spiritual than me and I guess closer to God than me and you know
7:44
I went from that place to my eyes opening up later as I um learned so much
7:50
from my spiritual father and realizing like at that moment right there in my place of surrender I wasn't doing
7:57
anything wrong I wasn't missing anything um I wasn't like not waiting on the Lord
8:02
enough for him to then give me some Vision or encounter or hear his Audible Voice or something no like that wasn't
8:08
the case at all um and then God started to open up my eyes so much and just
8:14
learning through my spiritual father as well that um you know the the the lack
8:21
of the power of God has made people do weird things like has made people go off course sometimes
8:28
like you have in the in the body of Christ you have Christians that are just content with
8:35
religion you know they're content they're not hungry I mean yeah they're not hungry and they're just staying the
8:41
same and they're just living religion but then you have those in the body of Christ um who their eyes have opened up
8:51
about religion and they don't want religion um their eyes have opened up you know to see in the word of God that
8:58
God is a god of power not of talk you know and that um the holy spirit is
9:05
alive and moving still today and that that he is wants to move through in Miracles and through the prophetic today
9:12
you have that group in the body of Christ but then in that group
9:19
um still at the same time it's like eyes have opened up but there's been a still a lack of the
9:26
anointing and then the lack so then so then you have this lack of the power of
9:31
God lack of true prophets lack of the real prophetic and it leaves people
9:39
like kind of um like searching for anything like uh it it leaves room for
9:48
confusion and disorder and um uh uh thinking it's God but it's the
9:54
angel of Light or thinking it's God but it's your imagination because you want something so much you want to hear um
10:01
God's voice audibly so bad that you like meditate on that so much that your imagination like creates things you want
10:09
to see God so badly the you know you want to see him physically so badly that
10:14
your mind can even conjure up Visions just like uh when I mean dreams are in
10:20
your subconscious when you think about something so much you could you end up sometimes dreaming about it and it's not
10:25
that God gave you a dream but it's the power of your mind it's the power of
10:30
meditating um and and and you can be really like forcefulness even if you
10:35
don't think you're trying to be forceful in some way maybe you think you're being seeking seeking seeking but it's
10:41
actually this this forcing that's happening it's making your mind to create things and so God brings Visions
10:48
God brings dreams God some Jesus sometimes appears physically he sometimes speaks an audible voice but
10:54
what I have come to find is that they aren't that is isn't as um
11:00
common as God is speaking he's usually speaking in a still Small Voice and there are times for all of these but a
11:06
lot of people think that he's coming in this way to his people constantly like
11:13
Visions constantly hearing the Audible Voice constantly God's speaking all these crazy things constantly when the truth
11:19
is is many times he he is speaking One Direction and he's asking you to follow it and the main thing he's speaking each
11:26
day is I love you I'm proud of you keep going in the still Small Voice that comes many times from Renewing Your Mind
11:32
with the word of God these are the things that God opened my eyes up to but I had been in these circles before these
11:39
Church circles where people were just spending hours like every
11:45
day trying to have this like um crazy encounter you know um and
11:54
and and in in a way that can sometimes be like you're seeking entertainment from God constant like God entertain me
12:00
like God come in a really exciting way when God is like saying I I'm coming in
12:05
a simple way and it's seems mundane to you I'm sorry but no apology from God
12:12
but this is my way um I need you to do work you know I think about like my life
12:18
like um my life I mean like leading up to it
12:24
there's a if people were to go behind the scenes I think some people would be like think some my life is sometimes
12:30
like boring because it's a lot of like work of God it's a lot of like doing
12:35
mundane work of God but that's so important and it's leading to so many
12:41
salvations and healings and freedoms and God moving power all this mundane like
12:46
stuff and just busy work or whatever um it leads to the most exciting things in
12:52
the world but the the the reality is is that some people are too busy chasing an
13:00
entertainment experience with God and leaving no time to do the really
13:08
important things that lead to God using them so
13:13
powerfully um yeah so uh
13:19
so I found that wow I was comparing myself like I was in that place of like
13:25
thinking I was that was that was part of the reason I didn't see myself is very spiritual and I didn't expect God to God
13:33
to choose me to be an apostle of the Nations and be a leader in his Revival
13:41
I that's one of the reasons I I didn't foresee that expect that I was shocked
13:46
is because I literally would compare myself to others um and I thought they were so
13:53
much more spiritual you know and um so we still remain humble not thinking
14:01
that you know we're better than others I don't mean that but it's important to
14:06
not to to to not be deceived and think
14:13
that just because people sound so confident in their relationship with God
14:18
or something and that they are describing all these big encounters
14:23
don't fall into that trap of comparing yourself and the enemy to come in that
14:30
way and condemn you and be like see look at all that they're talking about right
14:35
now like you're missing something see your your relationship with God doesn't look like that you're not hearing God
14:41
like that don't don't fall into that trap of comparison
14:49
amen hallelujah so um to answer the question how do not compare just having
14:55
your eyes open like this and realizing like man I shouldn't wait waste my time comparing number one because this can be
15:01
just the devil speaking lies through this whole Me comparison thing putting my eyes there um and number two when you
15:11
look at others let it let it inspire you only and renew your mind um God is always cheering you on God
15:19
always wants you to thrive and succeed so so renew your mind that if you're hearing anything else it's it's the
15:24
enemy trying to bring you down trying to bring condemnation how to continually have a
15:31
deeper love for God's
15:37
people Renewing Your Mind Renewing Your Mind as you think
15:43
about people as you think about certain people that God's calling you to minister to whether it's your family
15:49
your friends your co-workers the people in church um just
15:54
the certain people in your life that God is calling you to and beyond that um strangers people out there maybe like on
16:01
your social media accounts that will see things you post renew your mind to the
16:06
truth that so many their eyes aren't open up to God's love renew your mind to the
16:13
truth that so many are suffering from in bondage from the enemy they are really
16:19
suffering renew your mind to that truth renew your mind that literally I mean think about where you used to be and
16:27
that's the that's before you were saved that's the status of EV most most I mean
16:34
so many people out there so many people out there and and so many Believers so many Believers their eyes aren't open up
16:40
they still have oppression from demons and so um it's renew your mind when you're out
16:46
and about when you're out and about in public and just renew your mind to see in the spiritual realm like these people
16:54
have struggles these people have problems these people many people are crying at night
17:01
um renew your mind to this the spiritual truth that the devil is really after
17:07
everybody and until you have Jesus you have a relationship with Jesus and you
17:13
are encountering his anointing you're not walking in Abundant Life period there's no way it's possible
17:19
this only is found through Jesus and right now this is rare so this is the
17:25
reality so that even though even the Believers out there who have relationships with God many most of them
17:31
are not walking in Abundant Life and so if you you know make intention to think
17:37
about that truth to renew your mind to that reality get your mind off yourself um it's going to it's going to
17:45
build your heart I mean make your heart grow for people so when you're seeing people you don't just see them just as a
17:51
person walking by you see them as a person who needs Deliverance who needs to know God's love who who who need
17:58
needs this desperately and who's really suffering and struggling in life I'm going back through your comments from
18:03
what I was talking about before but the things that you don't see like the the hours editing and posting every single
18:10
day like there's not a single day pretty much like literally every single day I'm
18:15
spending several hours editing and posting every single
18:22
day and just doing other things that are needed for the ministry um
18:28
just many things like behind the scenes uh so it's it's a lot of just continual
18:35
just work that just has to get done that's not exactly fun and it's repetitive and you just do it again and
18:41
again and again and again for years again every day but it's really important to God it's really powerful so
18:49
much so much um power of God and miracles come through that mundane
18:58
continual obedience hard work how should we respond when we are
19:05
trying to love sacrificially but we sense
19:10
[Music] manipulation this you just have to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit um because
19:16
if you are sensing man manipulation then this is already a sign that this person
19:21
is not called to be very close to you like in your inner circle in your life
19:26
like have so much access to you like uh Jesus he had 12 who were close to him
19:33
and then he had three that were very close that was his like Inner Circle so if someone is manipulating you
19:40
and this happens in relationships this happens in Friendship because various reasons a person um wants attention a
19:49
person is afraid of losing you um a
19:55
person um just wants like your time wants someone to
20:01
just listen to them all the time or be a victim and like um receive like love
20:10
through um like encouragement but manipulating someone
20:17
you know like unnecessarily like whining and being a baby when you could be
20:23
strong you know there's just various reasons why this you know manipulation can
20:29
happen in people that that are not um completely free or have Jesus filling
20:37
every void or um are being obedient to God uh so that can happen and so when
20:45
you sense man manipulation happening you can this is just a sign right now that this person isn't called to be in your
20:51
inner circle close so that already means you need to put boundaries up so we
20:57
still called To Love everyone but we don't have the capacity to be God to everyone you know to to be you know how
21:05
God just loves all of his children and is continually loving them we can't be
21:10
loving every person in the world at all times with our actions and our words like each individual person right
21:16
obviously so there's going to be certain people that God calls you to give give more the people in your inner circle
21:23
like give more time to and more attention to and love individually with
21:29
actions and words more but then other people you you can't give all of that to
21:36
them the way you're giving to those in the Inner Circle so there will be times to love sacrificially to pour out but
21:44
it's not going to be like continually all the time it's not going to be like this person is manipulating to love you
21:50
and so you're just going to give them what they want you walk with the Holy Spirit to love sacrificially um when
21:59
holy spirit's leading but you have to just walk with him to know the boundaries to know when to you know say
22:06
no and put the boundaries up and realizing that you're still being loving it's not that you're cutting off love
22:11
it's just you are putting The Godly boundaries down where God is asking you
22:17
to but it's like you have to walk in wisdom because we we have to be we have to be careful to not get offended when
22:23
people are trying to manipulate us we have to be careful to be like
22:29
I see you you know trying to manipulate me like you know we have to be careful
22:35
to not be that way because it's not like people who are trying to manipulate are like evil you know some people don't
22:41
even realize they're doing it and sometimes it's just that they need to know God's love more and that's why they're doing it right so you have to be
22:47
careful to not just like shut down and stop loving them all like completely
22:54
because you sense manipulation you're like offended and you're like ew gross get away no you have to walk in wisdom
23:00
to um You're Still Loving them and you're seeing them with the eyes of God but you're at the same time protecting
23:06
yourself spiritually so when you have both of those things in your heart and your mind
23:11
holy spirit will lead you like how to navigate that situation how to put that
23:16
boundary down without without having hate you know and
23:21
offense but but but walking with Grace and love and wisdom yeah we have to be careful
23:29
especially with Brothers and Sisters in Christ we have to be careful [Music]
23:35
um that we're not letting the devil ever bring Nar a narrative about them towards us like we have to be careful that we're
23:42
not reading too much into things and being like o is that some manipulation there red flag on this person like we
23:49
have to be careful we're not you
23:54
know being too like um too protective that we're reading into things too much
24:02
and a person really isn't being manipulating or trying to be manipulating um and it's not a cause to
24:08
like Oh shut down I want to stay away from this person because I sense a little bit I think manipulation there we
24:14
have to be careful because the enemy wants to divide we you know when it comes to
24:20
um Brothers and Sisters in Christ like who we called to serve
24:26
alongside we have to be careful that the enemy is not bringing this narration that's
24:32
that's the the goal to bring division people aren't perfect and we
24:40
have to realize that and we have to have Grace you know we can't just shut off
24:45
everyone and um you know just sit around and wait for the perfect person as to come in close
24:53
to be a friend at the same time is someone someone keeps confronting you about your posts of the
24:59
new wine is it better to restrict them from your social media I live with them
25:06
so everyone should be able to have their own beliefs that they that they have
25:11
everyone should have that freedom legally in America for example or not just America but most many countries
25:18
legally most people have um freedom of religion freedom to believe what you
25:24
want to believe um and it's immorally unethically wrong to
25:31
harass someone because of what they believe so when someone
25:40
is like Alissa you just shared um someone keeps confronting you about
25:46
posting about certain things like the new wine what to do um if you live with
25:52
them so it's not it's not okay you know like you shouldn't be harassed ask just
25:58
because of what you believe in and so this is a time to like stand up for yourself and stand up for your faith and
26:03
lovingly share with them and say please just um it's okay that you
26:09
don't agree that's okay I respect what you believe and I want you to believe
26:15
whatever you believe you know but I just ask that you would respect um my faith
26:20
and and just kind of not keep bothering me and and um trying to change my
26:27
beliefs or anything so I you know just be confront a person with love and just
26:34
say I would appreciate it please if you could stop doing that um and
26:41
if if they won't do that then yes if it's on social media you can restrict
26:47
them for
26:53
sure if it's someone you don't know though and that happens on social media just you can just restrict them you don't have to go and have this whole
26:59
conversation with a stranger you know that's probably going to be a waste of time when they're just like a Pharisee
27:05
coming to attack I have no desire to go into the word do you think there's a spirit not
27:10
allowing me to want to be in the word I want to pray for you I'm going to answer your question I want to pray for
27:16
you so it can be different things it can be a lot of different things number one it can be an actual demonic spirit I see
27:22
this many times some people say like every time they try to read the word they fall asleep they can't stay awake
27:28
um sometimes people say every time they go to read the word something happens and they can't like read it so that's a
27:33
demonic Spirit there is a demonic spirit that will really literally try to stop people from reading the word of God and
27:39
spending time with God sometimes it's worshiping God I remember someone was delivered one time they testified at
27:44
fold church every time they went to worship God they're like their mouth would close up or their throat would close up or something they couldn't they
27:50
literally couldn't sing only when they're trying to worship God it wasn't just singing other things just worshiping God and they were set free
27:56
from a demonic spirit and then they were able to worship God whenever they wanted to um so it can be a demonic Spirit
28:02
sometimes um number two though I just want to explain what it can be different things when someone feels that so that
28:09
they don't have a desire to read the word um number two the spirit of religion condemnation shame can really
28:17
get in the way of that I know that I tried to read the word um before I encountered the power of God and surrendered fully I was in college and I
28:25
set out to read the word like every day for 4 years years and it like didn't like ever happen pretty much I think
28:30
ever and I was going to church twice a week I had no problem to go to church I loved going to church I loved God it was
28:36
my favorite thing to talk about was Jesus um but I there was something
28:42
keeping me from reading the word of God and it was the spirit of religion and so I felt so much condemnation and shame
28:49
for not reading the word enough pretty much at all that
28:54
[Music] um it made me not even want to read it even more because if I ever went to
29:01
think about reading it like it would fill me with so much condemnation and shame um and it's just like it's kind of
29:08
like um when Adam and Eve they they heard the voice of the devil tell them
29:15
like you sinned you're nasty you're gross you're ugly you're naked you need to get clothes and cover yourselves up
29:21
and hide from God and God was like where are you they were hiding and so that's
29:27
what happens in the spiritual realm today when you're hearing that lie that condemnation voice you haven't read the
29:32
Bible enough and that could be true but you you bypass the conviction from God
29:38
that's saying come read the word come be with me in the word and then you bypass
29:44
that you let the enemy hijack it and you let the enemy hijack it with condemnation saying you're gross you are
29:53
disgrace I'm so disappointed in you like this like the devil coming in that way
29:59
making you think it's God saying that and so you're like I'm so ashamed I don't even want to think about it hide
30:07
you hide and so you like hide from the Bible and that's what happened to me it's like I hide from the Bible because
30:13
every time I would even think about it I was reminded of um thinking that God was so
30:20
like ashamed and disappointed and um so then but then when I encounter God's
30:26
power for the first time and um and and my ey my spiritual eyes opened up to
30:32
God's love and it I realized wow that was never his voice his love is so amazing and his love is not there's no
30:39
condemnation in his love this love like I really met him and just like like um I
30:46
don't know like you know me for example right and so you know my character so if
30:51
someone were to say something against what you have seen and know of me you'd be like no that's not her so that's like
30:58
how it was for God like I had really met him and it was just like so much love right so much love that you just know
31:06
that there's no way he was like condemnation shame hide you better hide cuz I'm so
31:12
angry like you just that just knowing came over me that like that wasn't God
31:18
all that time I've met him now that's not him and so that's all it took to me
31:23
to run to the words and I ran to the word and I never heard that condemnation really pretty much again or if I ever
31:30
did I was like ah devil you can't trick me anymore you
31:36
know um so that's a big reason why so it's not really necessarily like a
31:41
demonic Spirit within the spirit of religion sometimes but it can be that you're believing these lies of the enemy
31:47
so much that you're just listening to those lies doesn't mean there's a demonic Spirit within that's keeping you
31:53
from the Bible but you've chosen to only hear the voice of the devil Maybe because you didn't know like me like I
31:59
chose to listen to the voice of the devil not knowing that I was choosing to listen to the voice of the devil but I my eyes hadn't seen yet so that's one of
32:06
the reasons why some people don't have any desire to read the word um and if that's the case if that's you you have
32:12
to renew your mind like I said I've heard that afterwards but now it's able to reject it so you have to make sure
32:17
you renew your mind this is who God is he doesn't condemn he's he's not shaming
32:23
me um these are lies of the devil and so the devil doesn't want me to read the word of God this is what's happening
32:28
right now so I reject those lies and I'm going to open up the word of God since the devil's trying to keep me from it
32:33
then I'm motivated now to go read it that's how you overcome that so that you're not in this stuck place of not
32:40
reading the word um and then uh then the other reason is that you don't feel like
32:47
reading the word could just be like your flesh is too strong um it could be a matter of discipline it could be a
32:52
matter of like you just need to make it a priority you need to
32:57
change your lifestyle and fit it in somewhere not just fit it in but make it a priority um and start with little and
33:05
make it a part of your life you have to have intention to if you if you want to
33:11
um be healthy you have to make intention to eat healthy you have to make intention to work out you have to like
33:18
fit it in your your schedule you have to make intention to eat water you you have to make intention to go to bed at the
33:23
right time and wake up or plan out how much sleep I'm going to be able to have you have to make intention and so it's
33:29
the same thing for the word of God it's not going to just the desire isn't usually going to just naturally come um
33:36
but when you can make the intention like I'm going to plan to read the word of God today it's going to be priority and
33:42
even if um even if I'm scheduled to do at the end of at the end of the night
33:48
then maybe that means it's like super late still I'll I'll spend just even 15
33:54
minutes more before I go to bed reading rather than just just oh it's late another day passed I didn't read the
34:00
word no make the plan make the intention just do it you know um re you know renew
34:07
your mind like this isn't this is isn't something that I've created to be in my mind that it's so difficult and heavy
34:13
it's not I can do this I can do all things through Christ so I can definitely open
34:18
up my Bible and spend 15 minutes today 10 minutes 5 minutes 1 minute even you
34:26
know um yeah so that's a matter of discipline and
34:31
realizing I'm not going to go by my feelings I don't feel like reading the word too bad I'm going to read it and
34:37
some of the word like Leviticus is honestly not Leviticus is talking
34:42
about um all of the laws like this is this law and this is this law and it
34:48
should be done this way and all it and honestly like it's not like super
34:53
exciting it can there's some parts that can be like kind of dry like that's okay you don't have to be like Oh I'm feeling
35:01
something powerful as I'm reading this like sometimes if if you know you're reading a certain part of the Bible
35:07
That's not like wild and whoa and getting tons of Revelation that's okay
35:13
don't um don't like create in your mind like I have to have this feeling and D
35:22
or else um I'm disappointed like sometimes just read word just get in the
35:28
word just get there just get there just be
35:33
obedient I want to pray for this person by the way um who was having a hard time reading the Bible I declare every Spirit
35:39
keeping you from reading the word and spending time with God it must go I declare every Spirit of religion must go
35:46
I declare from now nothing will keep you from reading the word from spending time in the word in Jesus name and spending
35:53
time with Jesus amen do you think it's a bad thing to
36:00
worry about all those who are so against God because I worry for them about God's
36:06
judgment because this is all so serious um so this happens like your
36:14
eyes open up your spiritual eyes open up more and more the more you go closer to
36:20
God the more you seek Him and part of your eyes open part of your eyes opening up it's like the love of God your eyes
36:27
open up more to the love of God and the eyes and your eyes open up more to the evil of the devil at the same time your
36:33
eyes open up to more of the seriousness of um serving
36:40
God and the good thing is that that leads to or that should leave lead to an
36:46
increase of the fear of God and the fear of God is critical to be constantly
36:51
obedient to God the fear of God is critical is crucial to
36:57
never stepping out of God's will because they'll be testing they'll be hard there'll be times when it's harder more
37:03
difficult to obey God when you have the fear of God that keeps you from being
37:09
disobedient ever when you really have the fear of God and you're like me
37:14
following God this is a serious thing me serving God me being obedient to God this is a serious thing this is not like
37:21
oh yeah I'm a Christian this is fun like this is serious like we don't play
37:28
around don't play around with obeying God like this is serious this is really serious that's that's important we have
37:34
this fear of God because otherwise you know I was sharing about this in my live
37:41
on Wednesday I was sharing about how sometimes God is coming in that
37:46
still Small Voice and you have to have the fear of God like I don't want to miss God like oh God's spoken this God
37:53
spoken this through a vessel God spoken this through this prophet got spoken this through my spiritual father and mother I'm a do it like not like you're
38:01
like um stressed I don't mean that and like anxious like what if I mess up and
38:08
no but the fear of God
38:13
like the fear of God like if you're if you're entrusted to carry 10 million
38:21
transported or something to somebody that's in need of it or something I don't know like you're like
38:27
probably you know not going to be the most like relaxed that day and that's
38:33
good like you need to be like right something valuable that you're you're carrying you know
38:40
um if if if the president of the United States or something or president of your country or prime minister or king or
38:46
queen or your country like sends you on this very important mission to do
38:52
something that's not going to be like a relaxing day and we love to relax that's our favorite thing right to be
38:57
comfortable it's not going to be exactly comfortable got that adrenaline going it's going to be like oh boy you know
39:03
you're not I don't mean worried anxious stressed but intense reverence and so
39:11
that's the lies we should live now the more the more you get this in you the
39:16
fear of God the less you're like anxious but like you are serious like you are
39:24
mature you you you you take the word of God seriously this is no joke you're not playing around um and um you you know if
39:33
when when when there are like just little as I mentioned on Wednesday like my spiritual father you know just
39:40
sharing about um these like one minute videos I shared how he instructed or how
39:46
he gave this prophetic um direction that the way the Rival is going to break out was going to be through one minute videos and so that I should post these
39:54
post make one minute videos post them and keep doing it until like just like how the Israelites
40:01
went around the walls of Jericho um and then they just kept going and then one day the Wall came down um Don't Stop
40:07
Don't Stop short they gave me another scripture that I shared on Wednesday as well about
40:13
um that uh the king that was told by Prophet Elisha to um to strike the
40:19
ground and he stopped short so that you should not stop short because you'll miss miss it you'll miss the promise
40:26
being coming um so like that was spoken very casually you know it wasn't it was
40:33
spoken like a still small voice but I had the fear of God like I must do this and I've done that ever since then like
40:41
I must do this like you know it's it's it's I take it very very seriously so um
40:49
so the fear of God is really where you
40:55
should like instead of worrying about people you should funnel that like
41:01
feeling funnel I don't know if that's the right word but instead of
41:06
worrying instead of worrying instead of using that energy to worry use that energy towards the fear of God and
41:12
obeying him um because the way that these people that you're worried
41:17
about um you know going against God the the only chance they have is by us being
41:24
the light of the world so the more really you'll you'll make an impact on the current Souls that you're
41:31
seeing not saved being saved so you should just carry that um love for
41:38
people instead of worrying fear of God to be the best vessel of God you can be
41:45
but but but but we are called to be the light of the world and be full of peace
41:50
and joy so so though it is serious and disturbing you know to think about such
41:56
things like that some people will go to hell you know to think about what some people will reap because of the things they're sewing like though it is really
42:04
troubling we should not meditate there the Bible says whatever is pure
42:09
admirable worthy of Praise good think of such things there's tons of dark things we could think about but there's tons of
42:16
good things we can think about and we should be focusing there more so we can be the bright light to save the people
42:22
instead of wasting time worrying and thinking about the bad things things and
42:27
not doing anything to help the the the
42:32
Lost how do we grow in the right revelation of the fear of
42:38
God to make your biggest passion I mean your biggest desire passion Mission
42:45
purpose in life to Simply obey God to take your obedience to God so
42:53
seriously that you every day that's so all you want is to please God is to
42:59
touch his heart that you never want to take him
43:04
lightly which means you can't take how he comes lightly the the his servants the words they speak lightly as
43:12
well um so like Renewing Your Mind of this truth like this is my biggest
43:19
passion this is why I'm on this Earth this is my biggest intention this is my
43:24
purpose to obey God like and to pray to the Lord to invite
43:30
him in that like Lord I only want to be in your will I only want to obey you I never want to disobey you I always want
43:37
to Value you respect you um the best way I can I never want to disrespect you so
43:43
help me Lord help me like I never want to unintentionally disvalue you disvalue your anointing your servants um Lord
43:52
help me this is what I want like put your FK your meditation your prayers
43:58
there and that's how the reverence for God will will grow in
44:05
you so it's it's not being afraid to
44:10
like mess up but um taking it so seriously um taking it
44:17
so seriously like when you get a job you don't want to lose the job you you you
44:23
get there on time you do your best you make sure you good good good sleep or something so you perform well like take
44:30
it seriously being a servant a vessel of
44:37
God how do you discern between rejecting the lies of the devil versus experiencing traumatic memories do we
44:42
just reject those memories as they come to mind yeah when traumatic memories come
44:48
to mind reject them reject them and immediately renew your mind put your
44:55
eyes on Jesus Jesus and think about whatever is good pure admirably worthy admirable worthy of Praise um put your
45:01
eyes on things that you um to that you're grateful for the blessings in your life and so so turn your eyes there
45:09
turn your eyes to Jesus turn your eyes reject that past is is no longer a part
45:18
of me um I don't need to relive or see that I I will not relive that or see
45:24
that again that traumatic thing that happened to me I reject that being a part of my life right now being a part
45:30
of my memory right now I being part of my vision right now mind I reject that
45:36
and then renew your mind look at Jesus immediately fill your mind with the the
45:41
good things The Godly things is there a spirit of always being late could it be a generational curse
45:50
um the being late is generally can generally be a
45:58
being constantly being late can be so strong a habit that it that it's kind of
46:04
more difficult to change but it doesn't necessarily mean it's a it's a spirit um
46:13
because anything any time that we have done the same thing
46:18
for a long time it's not it's it's many times not
46:24
easy to um make a change it it it's not something that
46:31
happens automatically it takes intention just like with reading the word of God if you're not in the habit of reading
46:37
the word of God it can seem really difficult to make to to start reading
46:42
the word of God but there's sometimes when we really we need to realize I have I have all I need in me like I can do
46:50
anything even things I can do even things that seem small that are so hard to do like open up the Bible or like
46:55
being on time I can do it but there's certain things sometimes like reading the word and sometimes like being on
47:01
time that takes a serious um first of all self-reflection to
47:08
realize um I am I am literally just not giving myself
47:16
enough time to get somewhere and I always want more time in the day and there just isn't more time in the day
47:22
and I try to really like almost go against this like I'm trying to live in denial or something
47:28
that's sometimes why one can be like late all the time is that they're like living in denial and so they're like
47:34
trying to squeeze out more seconds of the day minutes of the day that just aren't there um and uh sometimes it can
47:43
be a laziness thing sometimes it can be like literally not uh coming to light coming to the
47:50
truth the reality situation like you this it takes you this amount of time to
47:55
get ready and you are not giving yourself that so you need to make a change I know you don't want to I know
48:03
that it's going to take away from another thing that you want to do but you have to do this and to be on time
48:11
for for certain things it's it's um it's it's being respectful and to be late is
48:18
to be disrespectful is to be selfish um and can actually impact and
48:24
hurt people uh even if it's like even if it doesn't seem that big of a deal but
48:30
they're going through stress in their mind unnecessarily like I'm counting on this person where is this person what's
48:36
going on like so unnecessary when there doesn't need to be that you know so
48:42
um sometimes it can be like disciplining yourself Renewing Your Mind like this that I'm doing is actually selfish and I
48:49
have to be real with that I have to receive this conviction and just be real with myself
48:55
and be intentional and make this
49:00
change so I declare anything keeping you from uh holding you back from being on
49:07
time and always being late may may it be removed in jesus' name yeah if I just want to mention if
49:14
you find yourself not being able to do something be on time read the word of God um but you know God is calling you
49:21
to do this this is one an area many times you need to take authority in you need to say I can do this I will do this
49:28
I'm going to do this I'm I am going to do this I can do this speak it aloud um
49:36
that's this is part of taking intention you are you taking you're putting it into motion with something that's not
49:42
there you are you are bringing it forth nothing can hold you back and and and be
49:48
real with yourself and realize what you need to do to make this happen you need to go to bed earlier you need to set
49:54
your alarm you need to set your alarm many hours earlier if I mean you and you
50:00
need to realize you can do it you don't need to follow your emotions your
50:05
feelings um uh uh get an accountability partner have them help you remind you if
50:12
you need reminders set reminders in your phones like take it seriously use your brain
50:19
and realize the steps you need to put into action to make sure this happens because you can do all things through
50:24
Christ big things small things you can do all things as I prayed for someone this week
50:31
and was just sweeping with them throughout prayer I don't know how to stop this but it um makes me hesitant to
50:37
Pray Again do I keep pushing through or wait uh so just so just ask so just talk
50:43
with God and say Lord help me to be the best vessel of God I can vessel of you when I pray um so Lord like help just
50:52
help me to be a absolute vessel and no no distractions nothing getting in the
50:57
way not me getting in the way but help me to be the best vessel for you Lord help me to be strong um and so sometimes
51:06
crying as you're praying it's O it's okay sometimes maybe it would be a
51:11
little bit of a distraction or it's a moment you really need to be really walking in your Authority um so I'm not
51:19
saying like just cry all the time that's fine I don't I don't mean it like that but you also don't need to be um feeling
51:26
bad or insecure about tears coming um but just as you pray with God he will
51:34
give you strength he will give you strength um to be strong you know and so
51:39
um don't don't don't let anything stop you from doing what God is calling you to do being a vessel of him um praying
51:47
for people God can work through anything as you are crying sometimes it's it's it's
51:54
compassion it's beautiful sometimes this is showing God's love
52:00
um through you for them but as you but there is going to
52:08
come a time where um like when I Minister for example I'm
52:14
very much like Warrior mold like I am dealing with these demons I am Warrior
52:20
like we are setting God's people free today and just like really focus on
52:26
we're just going in the spirit and dealing with these things and um just actively at work kind of
52:34
thing rather than like contemplating and thinking so much um you know but more
52:42
like I'm in the action like Focus mode and so there will God will want you to
52:47
be more like very focus and in action and walk taking your Authority um and
52:53
and having compassion through that all having compassion in a different way not just crying but that will come just um
53:02
just uh walk with God Walk with the Holy Spirit keep being obedient and um he
53:07
will give you strength I want to declare over all of you right now thank you Jesus thank you Lord I
53:17
declare this anointing to come upon you now and may everything holding you back
53:25
keeping you from serving God keeping you in this place where you you could God
53:31
wants you to receive so much more but you are only receiving a little bit because you're not serving God you are
53:39
you are letting the flesh um Stay Stay stronger may this be removed from your
53:46
life now there is more anointing that God wants to pour into your life but it's on the side of obedience it's on
53:53
the side of giv on the other side of obedience on the other side of giving your all of surrendering everything it's
53:58
on the other side of sowing um when we do all these things we are receiving the
54:06
most that God wants to give us like there's so much that God wants to pour into us but it's not just God giving it
54:14
any old way many of these things come as we obey it comes as we do what God is
54:23
asking us to do it comes as we so and so may your eyes open up to these
54:30
areas now that you have neglected these areas that God has spoken for you to do and may the fear of God come in these
54:40
areas make the decision today with God make a covenant with God that things
54:47
will change from now you will get in the word from today make a covenant you will be on time from today make a covenant um
54:54
you will serve at you will serve you will serve God you will serve if you're
54:59
in person at fful church you will come and serve um make that promise to God
55:05
make that that this is this is what's going to help you when you make these promise Covenant is just responding to
55:10
what God is asking you God is asking you to do this you're saying yes God I will do this I will do this not
55:17
maybe when I feel like it well I don't want to commit well then you aren't
55:22
going to have any strength from God to be ble to do that so our life should be
55:28
a bunch of covenants with God I mean like when God is asking to do something it's a yes it's not a maybe CU I don't
55:34
really want to commit and then I'm like a liar and and then I this is going to take a lot of effort a lot of change in
55:41
my life a lot of discipline if you're real with yourself that might actually be what's going on sometimes and that's
55:47
not having fear for God we can't make obeying God an option it has to be a
55:53
must like yes Lord I will do this amen
55:59
so may your eyes open up now to see these areas in your life whether it's being on time serving at church being in
56:05
the word um maybe it's eating well maybe
56:10
it's um uh exercising whatever it is that you have
56:17
neglected and maybe it's like a a little thing like that that you know a little practical thing but God has asked you to
56:23
do this may your eyes open up now may you make a decision now just say it out loud right now just talk to God right
56:30

57:14
up to to see these things that you have missed that you have brushed under the
57:20
rug that you have been taking lightly when this is this is the big deal God is
57:25
asking you to do this may your eyes open up now may the fear of God come and may

58:05
anointing increase in your life upon these areas of obedience now
58:11

58:19
the anointing wasn't coming in these areas because it was up to you may that anointing come now in these areas May
58:24
there be no dryness May there be no lack Let There Be abundance in every area now
