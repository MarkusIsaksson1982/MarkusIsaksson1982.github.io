on the day of Pentecost they were filled with the fire of the Holy Spirit you know not just so that they
0:05
could have a great exciting encounter one time but they were filled with the holy spirit so that they could receive
0:13
power power of God in their life fire of Holy Spirit in their life continually to
0:20
help them be strong against the enemy to help them be more spiritual to help them
0:27
push down their flesh and be more like Jesus to help them to be a vessel of God
0:32
and to minister to others like that's the purpose of the fire of the Holy Spirit not just for some Grand you know
0:41
onetime encounter not just for one's eyes to be opened up more but for that
0:48
fire to be put in you and remain there and like like that is one of the most
0:55
beautiful things that has happened um and what's so much like the day of Pentacles
1:01
like like everything changed from the day of Pentecost where it wasn't just that one time one encounter but the
1:08
disciples the Believers were from there equipped to to to to be true disciples
1:15
they They Carried the fire to minister to others They Carried the fire to be
1:20
strong and I have seen that like I've never seen like that's the huge huge
1:25
like difference from what God did this time what makes it so much like Pentecost because maybe other people can
1:32
think it's Pentecost every time when it's Miracles happening which is true in some extent but there was something so
1:39
unique to the flourish conference so similar to Pentecost in in how like
1:46
Revival began from there and now this wave of Revival has hit and people have
1:54
been people all over the world now have been changed forever like never before
1:59
are being set on fire and it's it's United it's so beautiful like everyone
2:06
we are all on fire we I'm seeing the testimonies and you can just see change in every person like dramatic
2:15
dramatic change like day and night new person
2:22
completely and especially in the area of maturity and strength spiritually
2:30
um you know like seen rightly like God's amazing because we should be this way
2:35
all the time we should be living we should be this way all the time God's amazing he's faithful he's a god of
2:42
Miracles like this is the truth all the time and so it's like people are living
2:48
in the truth like never before living in the spiritual maturity like never before
2:54
God is so good this is the kind of spiritual maturity that God's looking for you know me I've um I've gone
3:00
through so many things that I can't share them all right now because like God doesn't release me to share certain
3:05
testimonies until like there's a even like greater
3:11
Victory like especially when it comes to um people opposing the work of God um um
3:19
Pharisees like um like there's certain attacks that have come my way in that
3:24
regard that I have not shared about that would shock you that would literally make you cry
3:30
and may probably angry like righteous anger of God that I literally haven't shared yet because God
3:37
hasn't released me until there's even more of a victory coming in that area um
3:44
but like there's so many times that I've you know me I've I've I've gone through these crazy things that you don't know
3:50
about sometimes I've gone through them right before ministering there's one time there was one um
4:00
all right I'll just share I'll just share this right now for with you all and I'll share the the specifics later
4:05
um the detail later but there was one time where um I was invited to minister
4:11
at a Revival's now event and um and it's like the church that was hosting it
4:19
um like the well like the one who is hosting it was going to have it be at a
4:24
church a certain church so the the the owners of that church they were just
4:30
allowing like in a business way like allowing them to use the space kind of thing and then uh Pharisee people like
4:36
strategically wrote to um these people and these these
4:43
um like lies like lies of the of the of like the devil's lies you know and just
4:50
sending them all these lies and like literally right before I was about to go Minister where the the the church is
4:56
just filled they wanted they they they told me um you can't have um I was want
5:04
wanting to have a meeting the next day and they were like you can't have a meeting the next day and um you can't lay hands on people and everything they
5:11
were telling me I couldn't lay hands on people and they were like very strict in this like you cannot um and I I
5:21
literally was crying you know like not in weakness but just like it just hurts so bad that you can't
5:28
help you know you know not weak tears but just like we're human you know as Jesus cried those kind of tears and um
5:36
and I just and literally like this was like 20 minutes before going to minister
5:42
and then I went to minister and God was calling me to be strong and minister to the people and I knew that I wouldn't
5:47
like God will move even if I don't um lay hands on people um and and so you
5:55
know with wisdom I knew like well it's not that I'm because cuz I knew if I
6:00
didn't if I was like to lay hands and just be like rebellious or whatever that they could literally like turn off the
6:07
sound turn off the lights or something you know what I mean so I just in wisdom um knew because I know God's
6:15
power I know he doesn't have to move through the lay on of hands so I knew Holy Spirit was telling me like I'm going to shift now like don't worry
6:20
about it you don't have to be laying hands don't worry about it I'm still going to move and I just preached with
6:27
strength and Authority Holy Spirit helped me and um I spoke just with confidence and
6:33
I spoke um I I I put the the the emotions I was feeling towards um the
6:41
love of God's people um and and like I just spoke with this like this
6:47
seriousness [Music] um you know what did I preach that day I just remember preaching something like
6:53
[Music] um we have to fight you know for this work of God and there will be people who
7:00
don't agree um but we we have to stand strong something like that and um God
7:06
moved so powerfully God moved so powerfully like most if not any would know what just happened and so um that's
7:14
just like a little Glimpse but what I what I mean is like I have a lot of these testimonies that I haven't even shared before because it's not the
7:19
timing to share them yet um and um and
7:26
like so why I'm sharing this is that like the life of a I want to give give you insight into the life of a of a
7:31
spiritually mature uh person a spiritually mature
7:36
disciple is that stuff happens like the enemy really
7:43
tries but the truth is that we have Victory no matter what no matter what the devil is trying to do God's like
7:51
when I was going through that I knew God's promises remain like you know all these people came here hungry to receive
7:56
healing and deliverance and they will receive it like all this junk that the devil's trying to um like lay on me or
8:04
just like whatever he's trying to do he will he can't win like okay can't lay
8:10
hands this is crazy you know um God's going to still move like the people will still be healed the people will still be
8:16
delivered um God's goodness doesn't change through this God's faithfulness doesn't change through this and people
8:22
being able to receive that that won't change and they and there's so many precious testimonies happened so many
8:29
precious testimonies came in God moved powerfully um and so like the truth didn't change you know like the truth of
8:36
God's goodness and his faithfulness and his power and that he wants to heal and deliver um that his promises will come
8:43
to pass like none of that changed and so like for me I had to choose to be strong
8:50
and keep my eyes open to the truth and stay there and not go over here and
8:56
shift my eyes to what the enemy is trying to say and do and focus how unfair this is how unjust
9:02
this is how cruel this is how um horrible this is like choose to not put
9:08
my eyes there but choose the people the people need to receive the people need to receive there will be Victory it
9:14
doesn't matter how I'm treated it does not matter my reputation it doesn't matter how people abuse me treat me it
9:20
does not matter what matters is God's will to be done what matters is God's people need to receive and so I have to
9:26
be strong be strong renew the mind shift the focus on the truth this is the truth
9:33
and when you live in the truth you you you you you live in the fire you live in the joy you live in the peace because
9:39
the truth is so beautiful it is so beautiful the truth it is so beautiful
9:45
so you're so that's where the strength is like I had so much strength of the Holy Spirit I spoke even I know that day
9:51
I spoke with more fire because Holy Spirit like helped me I felt so much
9:56
passion you know I felt so much passion like for the truth and for God's will to be done there's this fight for the the
10:02
work of God to be stopped so it put even more passion to fight for God's work and
10:07
God's Will and God's people and so even that day I preached even more with fire and passion you know and
10:16
so there was strength there there was Joy there there was fire there in in the
10:21
truth when my eyes looked at the truth and so I go through a lot of things that I don't share with you and it's such a
10:28
walk of strength it's it's such a walk of constant fire which with the fire comes from being in the truth staying in
10:35
the truth so um I know more people need to hear this
10:41
so I'll probably share this a lot of this on Sunday as I'm speaking this to you but um I just uh wanted to share how
10:47
beautiful it has been to see people live in the truth like this is how heaven will be we are rejoicing constantly we
10:54
are saying hallelujah holy holy holy like constantly all we can do is think how amazing God is all we can do is just
11:01
be in awe like everything else pales in comparison you'll notice that when you're living in the truth and you're in
11:07
the fire you're you're full of the fire you're in the truth everything else pairs in comparison uh uh uh you'd be so
11:14
excited to watch a movie before and now you're not you don't even want to you just want to keep thinking about Jesus
11:19
keep watching testimonies um keep spending time with Jesus um because
11:24
nothing in this world can give that joy and that fire and that that peace and
11:30
that passion like the Holy Spirit does like like what God does when you put your eyes on him and so it's been so so
11:37
so so so beautiful to to see people in the truth like never before and on fire
11:44
and being heaven on Earth being like how they are in heaven holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy holy
11:52
hallelujah hallelujah constant praise constant wonder and awe we are seeing
11:57
people are living this way here this is what we need to do this is how we will be the light Hallelujah so fire is not a
12:05
choice like for me being on fire like for me God's called me and for everybody but I'm just saying like my personal
12:10
testimony because you need to imitate me as I imitate Christ Hallelujah so for me
12:16
um being on fire is not a choice like the Bible says be strong and courageous like being being strong and being
12:22
courageous and being on fire is not a choice it's it's I have to be this way to be who I'm
12:28
called to be I have to be this way to be able to release what God wants to release through me to you I have to be
12:34
this way to be able to speak the true word in power I have to be this way to for the anointing to flow to to to be
12:40
able to to to to hear what God wants me to speak to be able to minister to God's people I have to be this way I have to
12:47
choose to stay on fire no matter what the devil TR like like I've I mean so many times I've had I I've had the most
12:56
I mean there's so many things I haven't shared with you that I can't to releas a testimony someday I cannot wait to
13:01
release it but there's so many like horrible cruel nasty um things like Pharisee type things words spoken things
13:09
done that have happened that really make that I mean I've just weeped and weeped and weeped and and then I have the um
13:16
live I think it was actually a subscriber Q&A live specifically one day and I just had to to just be strong and
13:23
and and oh just this storm came and I had to
13:29
like wipe away the clouds and renew my mind and and get the job done you know
13:35
do the job that God's called me to do and and go in the truth go in the truth
13:41
when I'm not feeling it cause my eyes to look at the truth cause my mouth to speak the truth when I don't feel it and
13:47
cause my smile my face to to reflect Jesus to to smile you know what I mean
13:54
like and it's and it's and it is truth it's not like fake it's truth it's truth because everything the devil does is a
14:00
lie everything that the devil does all of the attacks are lies like all of the attacks like even like when the devil
14:08
tries to stop the work of God and literally he brings damage like it's still a lie it's like you're not you're
14:15
not stopping the work of God like temporarily like you're causing damage but like the truth is you're not
14:22
stopping the work of God the the truth is millions will be delivered and healed and and encounter Jesus like that's the
14:29
truth so even when it doesn't feel like the truth it is the truth
14:36
hallelujah so when someone's not saved can can that hinder healing and deliverance so absolutely because people
14:45
have free will and um so many times Jesus says believe and you'll be healed
14:52
or you'll be set free he says this again and again and again and he couldn't do hardly any miracles in his hometown because of lack of faith so one of the
14:59
main keys for a person to receive healing and deliverance is to believe to
15:05
have faith to have faith that God wants to and will heal you or deliver
15:13
you um that he is the power to do it and that Faith should also include like faith that he's going to move through
15:18
vessels you know like to not be skeptical and critical towards the vessel that God wants to use so many
15:25
times that's the one of the main Keys needed for the healing or Deliverance to take place but if you have a child that
15:34
doesn't have that faith it does not mean like 100% they won't be healed or delivered absolutely not there's like
15:42
this is God's main principle but there's exceptions and we should put our faith in the exceptions and also believe that
15:48
God's working in the heart with seeds planted in his timing that the faith will come but like the Centurion Soldier
15:55
his his servant needed healing and so his faith made the servant to be healed
16:01
there's also a couple stories in the Bible where a where Jesus says believe that your child will rais from the dead
16:06
or believe that your child will be raised from the dead and I will raise her from the dead or believe your child will be he child will be healed and she
16:12
will be healed so he's not saying get your child to believe your child needs to believe so then we see these
16:18
exceptions in the Bible so that also has to do some that can also have to do with the person's age as well like if they're
16:24
a young child they might not have the understanding of faith and everything so then the parents Faith translates that's
16:30
many times in those instances in the Bible that we see where one one's one's when one's an adult they have this Free
16:36
Will factor in here to receive the inheritance of Jesus we got to want it
16:42
as well um but that's so but but even if someone doesn't have
16:48
faith what you are doing when you're connected to them as a family um with
16:53
you giving your life to God and you receiving the anointing it's definitely trickling over to them you are getting
17:00
drenched by the waterfall and they are hit they're getting hit by the drops of
17:05
water from you because you're drenched Hallelujah can we help serve at Revival Chicago of course God is calling you all
17:12
to serve like never before he is calling you all to get busy with his work like never before and this is how we keep the
17:18
fire this is how we keep the fire in us I was sharing with you today how uh earlier how my job is to keep the fire
17:26
my job is to be strong all the time even when I feel incredibly weak even
17:31
when the devil brought such a vicious attack that I weeped like never before in my life that I'm wailing with just
17:37
because it's so painful like God is always calling me to be strong and be on fire but I'm telling you one of the ways
17:44
I have the grace to do this is to keep my hands busy with the work of God
17:50
because like the fire is the fire that you have is for God's people so when
17:56
you're when you're using the fire accurately L when you're I mean when you're when you're like I have this fire
18:02
but it's not for myself like you all sharing testimonies this is so important this is how the fire is even increasing in you is because you're stewarding well
18:09
with what God gave you you all sharing with what God sharing you feel this passion for Jesus like never before and
18:16
the the testimonies that you have and you feel this Zeal to share with people like never before you feel this Zeal to
18:22
just be chatty with everybody and just share what God's done like the spiritual woman at the well that's you st Ting
18:29
what God has given you and that's going to increase the fire in you you're even going to see you're going to see um the
18:35
results you're going to see how you sharing your testimony like literally Chang somebody before your eyes that's
18:42
going to give you even more joy of the Lord to see God do do even more miracles
18:47
and see even more Heaven come to Earth and so that's even increasing you your fire just to even see God more because
18:54
you're seeing the anointing move through you so even for me what whether it's like preparing a message I'm focused on
19:01
the word of God that's putting even more fire in me whether it's editing a video
19:06
I'm watching that video I'm watching how powerfully God did that God delivered that person I'm watching that video
19:13
editing hearing their testimony just doing the work of God fills me with fire
19:18
even right now myself I feel a million times more on fired just remembering the
19:23
testimonies of how God strengthened me in those times of weakness and how God has been faith and just speaking to you
19:30
the word of God now is actually filling me personally with more fire Hallelujah
19:35
so God is calling you to keep this fire that's your instruction right now God's calling you to keep this fire so that's
19:42
going to look like one of the big ways it's going to look like is serving God is doing the work of God is keeping
19:48
yourself busy with the work of God like never before amen why is the spiritual
19:53
realm so complex if God is simp so simple the spiritual realm is not complex when your eyes are opened
20:02
up when your eyes are open the thing is is like the spiritual realm is so different
20:08
from the Physical Realm it's opposite so at first the spiritual realm
20:14
feels really complex because it's so it's like Beyond
20:20
one's understanding when they're not that spiritual when they're more carnal
20:26
physical but when God opens up your eyes things start to make sense like you know that feeling when like someone like I'm
20:33
someone's preaching like when I'm preaching and it's like this new revelation came to you and your eyes
20:39
opened up and you're like aha you're like that makes sense like I remember um
20:47
just having this like confusion about God like not really getting it like
20:52
why why are there all these Christians and really good people that have such horrible things happen to them and die
20:58
so young and like all these things like it didn't make sense you know like but I
21:03
didn't spend that much time like thinking about it and being confused about it but it made me like
21:08
not understand God's love so as well because of that like confusion and then
21:14
I'll never forget by being where the power of God was true anointing at my spiritual father Prophet Dr Jord D's
21:21
church and I'm I witnessed him ministering to people who were oppressed
21:27
and it was the first time I witnessed m deliverance and it was the first time
21:32
and only time besides like in my Ministry that I've seen like popcorn like so fast
21:39
demons manifest and then the power of God immediately deliver a person and quickly and simply and um boom boom boom
21:46
boom boom boom boom person after person and so I had never seen that before that moment and um after witnessing all that
21:54
like witnessing that mass Deliverance um I had this strong Revelation that came I had a lot of
22:00
Revelations like how real the devil was how how how much he's behind the
22:07
people's problems I had that Revelation and then I had the revelation of how
22:12
powerful God is how he's so much more powerful than the devil and how powerful this love is but then the but the one
22:19
Revelation I want to tell you about that came to me that day was when I witnessed that cuz it was like these people are
22:26
struggling they're oppressed and then the demon hum are speaking out of somebody saying I'm trying to kill her I put a stone in her throat this is how I
22:33
tried to kill her this time and she currently had a stone in her throat and then I saw the power of God moved through my spiritual father and command
22:38
the demon to go and the the the rock to come out of her mouth and The Rock literally came out of her mouth it was literally like lodged in her throat like
22:44
the demon was so powerful the demons literally like spoke like I tried to kill her this way and this is how I
22:50
tried to kill her now like um um and so I'm seeing like all these
22:57
people have these issues but demons are behind it and then I saw for every
23:04
single person every single person many many many many people that have all these problems that are so oppressed
23:09
Jesus delivered them through my spiritual father boom boom boom boom boom demon go demon go demon go deliver
23:15
deliver deliver everyone there wasn't one person that was rejected there was not one person that was turned away
23:20
there was not one person that was like H I don't feel like it I don't feel like delivering you everyone you know and so
23:27
that day it was like I got this Revelation this is how it's supposed to be this is how God wants it to be this
23:33
is Jesus so many of these problems all of these issues are spiritual they're
23:38
demonic and God has the power and wants to use that power to heal and deliver this every person every person every
23:46
person but God has a way of moving he moves through vessels he moves through them with authority he doesn't he moves
23:53
through his anointing he doesn't just give his anointing to just anybody you need to be humble to receive the anointing you need to be be humble to
23:59
God's ways you can't do it just any other way and so my spiritual father is
24:04
doing it God's ways my spiritual father is humble God can trust my spiritual father with this anointing and so now
24:11
whoever comes to my spiritual father's Ministry everybody gets delivered everybody gets healed this is what God
24:17
wants this is what God want like that Revelation came to me on that one day
24:24
that one day that re and it became simple so I share that because when your
24:31
eyes open up it's simple it's not complex like that's so simple like all
24:36
these problems people have why doesn't God heal them how come God heals some how come some things come back and like
24:43
all it seems all so complex but really the reality is is God has the power to
24:49
do it and wants to do it but it has to be God's ways and so many people will not do it God's ways because they are
24:55
not humble enough and God's ways require immense humility so the result is people are
25:02
missing out on the power of God to heal and deliver them so anyways um that's just one
25:10
example you you the more the more your eyes open up by being humble the more
25:16
things click and make sense and like the kingdom government like so many people
25:22
even though it's quite clear in the Bible like about Authority like we see the way
25:28
Paul cast out demons we say the way Peter casts out demons but then today people over complicate it and they're
25:34
like making casting out demons so complex when it's really just supposed to be about the principle of authority
25:41
and as I've I've taught I'm not going to teach all about this go to my Revival army training um specifically I think
25:49
where I talk about the kingdom Authority there's a message about that I believe and how to cast out
25:55
demons I believe part one and part two will really share more of this but I
26:01
know a lot of you who are here have heard me teaching many times about the kingdom government of God I mean the the
26:08
the kingdom government like how it operates and how there's different
26:14
levels of anointing and authority and um how we have to be in line with the
26:20
kingdom government of God and not just do our own thing but abide by the
26:26
principles of authority of Kingdom just like you don't go to the president and
26:33
say can I do your job or you don't try to do the president's job or you don't
26:39
just go and repeat the president's commands as if you're it's going to be
26:45
doing something beneficial by you doing that you know um we understand Kingdom
26:51
we understand government when it comes to like the Earth like Society um but that should
26:59
translate to the the kingdom of God and like so for me it makes sense it's like
27:04
my eyes are open I know for many of you like it makes sense it's simple it's clear um but for so many
27:12
people they're casting out demon some other way trying to and this way doesn't
27:18
make sense to them this way it's they don't understand it's because their eyes aren't opened but when your eyes are
27:23
opened it clicks it makes sense it's simple so um it's only that I think things seem
27:32
more complex because of when the devil brings bondage and it's not that it's
27:37
like really confusing it's more that the devil is
27:42
sneaky and tries to find loops and holes to bring bondage upon people and so it
27:50
can become more complex a person's bondage and the keys that unlock their freedom based on the devil being sneaky
27:58
if that makes sense like when a person does this and this in and this in they
28:04
don't mean to do this in but they do this in like it it it makes it to be
28:09
like um just they're intertwined they're they're just like
28:17
intertwined with chains you know what I mean like they're speaking such words of death over here and then they got
28:24
involved with new age over here and then someone in their past generation was doing witchcraft over here and then that
28:30
was passing down to them and then um uh uh and then their mother spoke curses
28:36
over them when they were in the womb and um then they they they had this
28:43
relationship that opened up the door to manipulation and that um like and then
28:49
they started believing the lies of the devil speaking about their identity and um they believed that they were
28:55
homosexual or something and now they're speaking these things so the devil speaks all of these lies
29:03
and can when someone is not they don't have their eyes open up to simply just be
29:08
surrendered and um follow God's instructions and his
29:15
principles things get complex but that's the devil's doing and it's not like it's
29:21
complex for somebody to be free as long as they will believe in God and believe
29:26
in the apostles and Prophets like as the word of God says as I was sharing at the conference those of you that weren't in the conference um what is it I forget
29:34
the exact scripture but it says believe in I can find it
29:44
here here we go um 2 Chronicles 20 uh 2 Chronicles 20:20 believe in the Lord
29:51
your God and you shall be established Believe In His prophets believe His prophets and you shall
29:56
prosper um and so we need to believe in the apostles the prophets the prophetic word the the prophetic word of today
30:04
bringing upon revelation of the word of God to under to to to know God's principles and to follow God's
30:10
principles so when the prophetic word comes with this prophetic instruction I
30:15
see that these are the keys that are unlocking their your freedom you know to the Apostle to the prophet to the one
30:21
getting this Revelation it's not complex they're seeing it oh yeah they open the door here they open the door here they open door here so this is the key to
30:27
rounce this here to throw away this thing here to you know these different Keys prophetically you just follow them
30:35
follow the word of God the prophetic word of God and you're free so that's what I mean the kingdom of God is Not
30:42
complex like if we will do things God's ways it's simple we a baby can understand the the
30:49
children can understand right but it's just that you your eyes have to be opened
30:56
up so you have to keep humbling yourself so your eyes open up more and more and more and
31:02
more amen I just have a prophetic word right
31:07
now I I hear God speaking like to not worry about long long term because there's something so precious that God
31:14
is doing right now um like ausa you know like ausa like the revivals you hear
31:20
about um it's so valuable that people just come across the world and just like
31:26
stay for it they don't want to miss this outpouring of what God's doing and
31:33
so with this wave of Revival it's not time to think about one year two years 5
31:39
years 10 years like maybe you've had these plans and these desires to live in a certain city or to move in a certain
31:45
city and maybe God has even called you to move to a certain city so you've had your eyes set there but there may be a
31:50
detour that God has planned like for some of you I see prophetically like you are I see prophetically some people it's
31:57
like you're supposed to you'll end up in the city that you are currently in or you'll end up in a different city that
32:02
God's calling you to in the future but it's for your purpose of releasing his
32:08
anointing his fire and so you need to be really filled up you need to be prepared
32:15
and equipped before you do this job and that's going to take coming to the well
32:21
and getting filled and filled and filled to overflow and equipped so I see prophetically because I see a lot of
32:28
God's speaking and pulling this heart to to come to La um and to be part of this wave of
32:35
Revival and so this is what I hear God saying like don't be confused with like
32:41
past dreams thoughts promises because these things are like five years down
32:46
the line 10 years down the line one year down the line two years down the line
32:51
and there's a detour I'm bringing like to get there and then some people God's
32:57
calling you to to even move to LA and just like stay there like maybe for life
33:02
like it's just it's different all that God's calling but I do know I see prophetically that God is speaking to
33:08
people to to Really treat this as the Revival that it is to treat this as the
33:13
Revival that it is to treat this as the Revival that it is to treat this as the
33:21
Revival I I just repeat that because that's the word that brings the clarity
33:28
like when you look back in time you don't want to miss it you know what I'm saying
33:33
like always when things happen real time it's harder for people to see the
33:40
value the value of it and then later on there can be like regrets you know later
33:46
on like oh wow I didn't realize like how precious this was you know um so yeah so
33:54
I just I just hear God speaking that right now like if there's confusion like you felt you were supposed to like maybe
34:01
be in your specific City and bring Revival to your specific City but now God's calling you you feel this calling to come to LA and you're confused don't
34:08
be confused anymore because I see it's very important for some of you it's very important for you to either move here or
34:14
for you to come for months or come for one month or come for one time each month or something like there's going to
34:20
be different things that God will be leading you to based on like Finance finances that you have and the season
34:27
you're in and your job it's going to be different for everybody but I I truly see this this call to the we this call
34:37
to to to to to receive more and more and
34:42
more and more and grow and grow and grow at supersonic speed you know by making this Sacrifice
34:49
by being so serious a new level of seriousness so that you can fulfill your
34:55
calling so that you can fulfill those PR promises that God has spoken to you in your heart which for some of you are to
35:01
bring Revival to um a a certain city a certain Nation different from where you are currently or in the actual City or
35:09
or country that you're City that you're in now I have a relative in bondage and he tends a church with some power of God
35:17
should I direct him to 5f does that go against principle of being planted absolutely direct him
35:24
because this is extraordinary anointing because because this is Kingdom this is Kingdom this is Kingdom like there's not
35:32
supposed to be different denominations there's not supposed to be all this division in the church in the acts Church it wasn't like Paul has his own
35:39
church and Peter has his own church and they're like divided you
35:47
know that's not how it's supposed to be it's supposed to be Kingdom and so how it's supposed to be
35:55
globally which is hard to what I'm about to say is hard hard to imagine because it's really not what we see in the body
36:02
of Christ today but it's really supposed to be uh Kingdom and unity where there
36:08
would be an apostle Paul of today or an apostle Peter of
36:14
today and there would be um you know Philip the Evangelist there would be
36:21
Matthew there would be different Apostles there would be different prophets and there were recognized as
36:28
true Apostles from God true prophets of God not oh that's that church that
36:34
Ministry separate um there's this is a true anointed
36:40
pastor this is and like Apostle Paul acts 1911 it says God was doing
36:46
extraordinary miracles to the hands of apostle Paul that even handkerchiefs and aprons they would bring up to his body
36:53
and put them on the sick and oppressed and the sick and the oppressed would be healed and freed
36:59
so extraordinary anointing was upon him and so some
37:04
demons are very high demonic powers that need extraordinary
37:10
anointing and so we're supposed to be a body United
37:18
it's supposed to be like oh that's where there's extraordinary anointing go receive extraordinary anointing it's
37:24
supposed to be like oh I received impartation from from this Apostle Paul of today even though it's a different
37:32
Church name or sometimes it it will be a church Branch but there's supposed to be this openness this
37:37
humility and respect and um Unity uh I received this impartation
37:45
from here you know I and and that we're United so um that being said I'm not saying
37:54
like Okay right now there is so much old wine there's so
38:01
much religion so now is not the time for
38:09
like now like what what I'm trying to say is it's the pioneering beginning
38:14
stages of this end time Revival the anointing is rare so it's not the time right now for
38:22
me to say like this is a true Prophet over here this is a true over here this
38:28
is true Pastor over here this is a lot of these that will come will are around now but haven't
38:35
been anointed yet um are being discipled the time has
38:41
not come yet um but for for those leaders whom
38:47
God has already raised up those Ministries God is already raised up like 5f
38:54
church it's supposed to be like recognizing the king Kingdom government in at work it's supposed to recognize
39:01
this is God's end time Revival this ministry is a big part is leading the end time Revival there's
39:09
supposed to be that recognition there that's why I said that prophetic word in October that the older generation God is
39:15
calling them to pass the the Baton to the newer generation the meaning of that is the older generation is supposed to
39:22
be recognizing this is an apostle Peter this is an apostle Paul of today's time God God has brought the end time Revival
39:29
we have been missing so much of what we see in the acts church we have not seen
39:35
we've been praying and crying out for the for Revival for end time Revival for
39:40
True Apostles and Prophets to for God to raise up for um God's power his
39:46
anointing healing Deliverance the way the power of God moved so mightily and easily through Paul through Peter we've
39:52
been crying and praying out for that God and now people are supposed to recognize God is answer the prayers people are
39:59
supposed to recognize leaders are supposed to recognize it's here God has raised up this servant of God God has
40:04
raised up this servant of God and they're supposed to United as a whole body of Christ say this is the end time
40:10
Revival this is who God has raised up leading the end time Revival Hallelujah like and let like and use what God's
40:18
given them for God's glory to open doors you know to to to let people know like
40:26
come receive like wow we've seen people in bondage for so long and now people
40:31
don't need to stay in bondage here's an apostle Paul of today an apostle Peter of today that God has risen up risen up
40:39
um to to release this anointing and we can all receive this anointing and receive impartation and we can Now cast
40:44
out demons too because the anointing God is released now you know that's what is supposed that's what's supposed to be happening right now and it's really sad
40:52
that um for the most part it hasn't like for the most part it's been like non-existent pretty much but um you know
40:58
God's word in October is that he's asking his the older generation to pass the Baton but if they don't he will pass
41:04
the Baton what does that look like him opening doors himself him just moving in
41:09
different ways that make space for um his true Ministries his true
41:15
servants he's raised up his Revival to go to the next levels to reach certain
41:21
places that there's been a ceiling over them um you know just in his power
41:28
making it just so undeniable um that doors open that doors
41:36
just must open using strange ways you know moving in certain people's hearts
41:42
unexpectedly um that's what he will do and um yeah so anyways um that's the
41:49
answer to that question so it's important for you to recognize like the end time Revival is here and it's
41:56
important for you to to recognize the kingdom government we haven't seen yet like many other ones but they're out
42:04
there and some of them haven't been risen up and anointed yet so um it's important to know we're in the beginning
42:09
stages but God has revealed truly where his power is where his anointing is the testimonies the Miracles so um it's
42:18
important for you to see like follow the fruit like there's all this fruit here
42:23
and people could benefit so all I'm going to do is just tell people about the fruit invite them I'm hearing all these people
42:29
be healed and delivered and touched by God so my job is simply to tell them about it that's your job and then it's
42:36
the other person's job to realize like God's calling me here you know God's calling me to Greater like God's maybe
42:42
calling me to actually be planted here and receive here it's that person's job but it's your job to just share share
42:48
share testify testify testify you need to have the fear of God to realize so many people are stuck in the in the old
42:55
wine unnecessarily um and it's your job to O uh speak and
43:01
and let their eyes see let their eyes open up you know it's like it's kind of
43:06
like um feeling like is it wrong to tell John the Baptist's disciples to um you
43:13
know come attend the ministry of Jesus like you know it's um the same team but there was a greater thing there was a
43:19
new wine that was being brought you know um so so God was calling John the
43:25
Baptist to then say come receive here it's even greater here it's even greater anointing with Jesus
43:31
here let's all come and be humble in that way um but he struggled with that even John the Baptist struggled with
43:37
that like humility because he said he said he sent one of his disciples to say
43:42
to Jesus are you really the one or is someone else coming okay but you know when you're
43:49
humble your eyes open up to see this truth you have no problem seeing the spiritual truth so the fact that he was
43:55
having problems like seeing the spiritual truth just shows that there was that conflict there you know he was
44:01
the the leader of that time and it's not to say like anything against John the Baptist I don't mean anything like that
44:07
but it's just to kind of share what it's like in today's time it's like that that
44:12
conflict from within that some people have um when when when something greater comes when a greater anointing comes
44:19
when Revival comes will you be humble and say there's even greater happening
44:24
here there's even greater anointing let's all go here or will you be like jealous you
44:32
know should we expect the wave to continue to grow for decades we should expect the wave to keep growing until
44:38
Jesus returns yes this is the end time Revival I shared um you know I shared a word
44:48
early this year I think it was February I shared a word that I said
44:55
we've only seen about one % or so of what God's about of what we'll see God do even In Our
45:01
Lifetime not even just talking about lifetimes to come and I think after flourish
45:08
conference maybe some of you understand that a little more now like how there's
45:14
so much more like how there's so much more that God wants to do and has in store and has
45:21
planned hallelujah how do you know if God is putting a desire in your heart for Ministry versus having a greater
45:27
passion to serve so Ministry and serving is the same like like our job is so simple that
45:37
God's called us to do is to be the light of the world is to lead others to Jesus is to
45:45
be a pure vessel of him to have his complete way to pray for somebody when
45:51
they need prayer when they need healing or freedom to speak an encouraging word to speak a prophetic word to their Liv
45:57
life and so whether you're a fful minister or
46:03
you're just a a Believer who's not a fivefold minister it's the same job now
46:09
a fivefold minister um is given a different Grace and is um called to do it in a more
46:18
extreme way and uh more often way like
46:25
constantly um and you know but but overall I just want
46:31
to say it's like the same thing and so I think sometimes people have such a passion for people to know Jesus and
46:37
they think it automatically means I'm called to be a pastor I'm called to start a church and um I'm called to be a
46:44
fful minister because I have such a passion to see people free and you know
46:50
but it doesn't necessarily mean that we are all called to that and God wants all of us to have that
46:57
passion and um you know God reveals everything in his perfect timing and so
47:04
so often people try to want to try to figure out like what is this passion mean in me is am I called to be a
47:10
minister what is my purpose and so often um thinking too much about it can be not
47:18
a good thing because sometimes it's like just not God's timing to release that uh to release that or to not release that
47:26
and um sometimes we can get ahead of God and act prematurely so what I say to you like if
47:33
you're you know feeling such that passion and you're trying to figure it out I would say don't try to figure it out just serve god with everything
47:40
that's within you and uh God will do the rest God will speak if he needs you to
47:46
serve in a different way in a different capacity in a particular way he will speak it when you're when you're planted
47:53
when you are surrendered God will speak it and so in my case case you know I was different there was like not really that
48:00
there wasn't like the end time Revival here yet when I surrendered to God and
48:05
um when I received my calling so I was some a different case where I wasn't
48:11
like planted yet where God was calling me to be planted like to have a spiritual father I mean um that didn't
48:18
happen yet but I was s surrendered and I was so passionate for Jesus like never
48:25
before and all I wanted to do was to invite people to where God's power was moving that was my biggest passion and
48:31
so I just did that I just did that I just did that and um then I received
48:37
this prophecy over my life and I just said yes God even though my feelings
48:43
like didn't want it at all but I just wanted to obey God more than anything so I said yes God but I wasn't excited
48:49
about being an apostle I was so excited for people to encounter God's power I was so excited for people to be set on
48:55
fire for Jesus like was I was so excited for people to their eyes to open up to God's power I was so excited for people
49:01
to be delivered and healed I was so excited for that but I wasn't excited
49:07
about like me being an apostle like me being a minister and
49:14
um I would see my spiritual father and even though I knew like logically I knew
49:20
God's calling me to be like him God's calling me to receive impartation from him like Elisha received from Elijah
49:28
um logically I believed that and knew that but I didn't feel that I was just
49:34
like it felt so far away um that I when I saw my spiritual father I wasn't like
49:40
I can't wait till I can do that that wasn't in my thoughts at all I was so
49:45
overcome by how I was blessed by the ministry of my spiritual father and how so many others have been that all I
49:53
could think was like was very simple it was just like I want people to receive what I've received I want people to
49:59
receive God's power where have I seen God's power like never before through my spiritual father um I want people's eyes
50:04
to open up to God's love like never before where have I experienced that through my spiritual father I want people to be delivered and healed where
50:11
have I seen that like never before deliverance and healing through my spiritual father and so for me it was very simple I was just like like I
50:18
wanted the world to know my spiritual father I wanted everyone to be able to receive the ministry through my
50:24
spiritual father like how I had it was just very like simple-minded like I've been so blessed more than ever I've been
50:30
brought closer to Jesus more than ever through his ministry and so I just want this for the world and like my focus was
50:37
really there and looking back like that was a really good thing
50:42
because I mean like it like that's what God wanted because it was like it was
50:47
humble you know it wasn't like my mind wasn't like oh I get to carry this power and be
50:56
an important person like my spiritual father and like you know like
51:02
um oh that will be so amazing for me to be casting out demons like he casts out
51:07
demons and I never had a like thought like that you know I didn't even want it I
51:14
couldn't see how it was going to happen either even though I believed but so my mind was just
51:20
like just one track um for a while um but like looking back I see
51:27
like God wanted it that way cuz even though God had called me to be an apostle he didn't want me to be like
51:33
yeah I'm going to be an apostle I'm excited about my calling like out of like he wanted me to just
51:41
want people to receive whether it was me scrubbing the toilets for my life even
51:47
though I was already called an apostle but in my heart whether it was me scrubbing the toilets in the church for my life um and just inviting everybody
51:54
to come receive from my through my ual father or whether it was through me ministering and the anointing moving
52:00
through me like looking back like that's God really wanted that in me and so for
52:07
like several years I was solely focused there I wasn't like excited to be an
52:12
apostle I believe God was going to move through me but I wasn't like I'm so excited for the anointing to come through me and people to be delivered
52:18
and healed I was just like I want people to receive the anointing through you you know and but looking back that like God
52:26
wanted that like kind of humility in my heart to like to like see
52:32
myself as so much like less than my spiritual father in a humble way you know and to see myself as like not
52:39
worthy of carrying the anointing like in a humble way like um I don't deserve
52:45
this like like I don't deserve this I'm not entitled to this who am I like God really wanted that to be in my heart so
52:51
so strongly you know so I I know that that's why God took me through that time of
52:58
um just honoring my spiritual father and not getting too excited I guess like
53:07
about being a minister myself so um that like really taught me like that really
53:15
taught me that that's how God wants people like he do he he just wants people to be focused
53:22
on the on on God's work not focused on themselves being a servant of God not
53:27
focus on themselves being a minister not focus on what they can do for God H not
53:33
focus on how they can look important for God not focus on what they can do to make themselves feel so important and
53:39
how they can look successful you know what I mean um and honestly that can get in there in the heart that can I mean
53:46
you know striving success how people see you that's a thing that everybody has to deal with ego so I just share that
53:54
because I I see a lot of people many times like trying to figure out their calling and like like feeling a call to Ministry and
54:02
I always am like I always feel this in my heart like I want you to have what I
54:07
had like I want you to just like stop thinking about it because it's not your job to anoint yourself it's God's job to
54:13
anoint you it's God's job to to to to bring a prophet or an apostle like to to
54:19
speak this word to anoint you and to release you and you know to to to say to
54:25
to have a spiritual covering so you're not just off on your own and to make sure you're in God's order and God's
54:30
timing um and to be protected to have that covering so I want that like what I
54:36
went through to be in everyone's heart where they're not trying to figure things out too much they're not thinking
54:41
about so many things they're just focused on I want people to encounter
54:46
Jesus's power this is how I've encountered Jesus's power so I'm going to invite others to encounter Jesus's
54:54
power how I have because this is where it is this is how it's happening like to be so focused there instead of being
55:00
distracted and trying to focus on yourself and your calling and and everything you know what I mean and
55:06
being distracted right so um and it's a test like how I was like God wants it
55:13
that like God wants you to be that way where you're like so passionate about God's work you're so passionate about
55:21
like God's true Ministries like you're you're so passionate about it you're you're really a servant heart you're
55:28
really like contributing to the work of God you don't care if your name's on it
55:33
you don't care if you get credit for it you don't care if you're seen but you're really contributing to the work of God
55:39
that's your passion so having that heart of I just want this person free whether
55:45
I cast a demon out of them by God's power or um someone else does the the
55:51
the the minister where of my church where I'm pled cast it out like I just want this person free and so like when
55:58
we see for example someone on the street or a friend or something and they're they're oppressed that's what the heart
56:04
should be not like oo this is my opportunity to cast out a demon you know what I mean but like instead like I want
56:11
them free I want them free and so Holy Spirit whe because sometimes sometimes
56:16
it's um maybe they have more they have they have a deeper demonic bondage where
56:23
they need a stronger anointing so in that case maybe God will lead you to to pray for them but you know they need
56:28
more and not just more Deliverance but they need to be planted they need to be equipped so you you have that passion
56:34
for God's kingdom and you invite them and you invite them with passion
56:40
amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and that's the
56:45
heart that we have to have also with um how God's Dominion I mean God's God's
56:52
order of his principles of dominion and Authority you know like what when Apostle Peter
57:01
ministered everyone who was under his shadow was healed and delivered everybody um and now it doesn't say in
57:07
the Bible that they all experienced the manifestations immediately some might have seen the manifestations later like
57:13
the lepers that came to Jesus and he said show yourselves to the priests and on their way they were healed so but but
57:19
this is God's order it doesn't say that there were it whenever we see Peter or Paul or any fful Minister when we see
57:27
any of them ministering anybody ministering in the acts church we don't see a group effort prayer like to cast
57:34
out a demon to release healing we don't see any example that at the church
57:39
service um this Minister was casting a demon out of this person and this person was casting out a demon out of this
57:44
person that's not God's order it's it's whoever is the leader of that church or
57:51
if it's a guest speaker for that day they have the authority of Christ in that church service and God has given
57:57
them that and so just as all demons and sicknesses had to go as Peter walked by
58:02
with his shadow that's the same principle whoever is ministering the lead the leader of that church or
58:08
whoever is ministering that day God has given the authority upon them the demons obey to that Authority not to others
58:15
that's their dominion and so when they speak all demons must go all demons have to
58:21
go they have to obey they have to
58:26
um now there could be some person that doesn't want the deliverance and then those that demon can stay you know I'm I'm talking about in general when people
58:33
are surrendered have faith and it's God's timing I want to deliver of them of this P of this thing right now when a
58:39
true anointed Minister declares like Peter all demons have to go but like other people can have in their hearts I
58:46
want to cast out demons too like not in a pure way and um people could still be
58:52
manifesting after the church service still getting delivered or maybe maybe it wasn't God's timing for someone to be
58:58
delivered of a certain layer yet that that will come the next Sunday maybe um or maybe someone is just not having
59:04
faith and thinks that they need one-on-one prayer so that they're asking people around saying pray for me pray for me but that's going outside of the
59:11
order and it's dangerous to go outside of God's order a kingdom divided cannot stand the
59:19
Bible says so the more we are united the more we're United with God's order the more we're respectful to God's order
59:26
the more as we in the church are respectful to God's order not going outside of the order and his principles
59:32
the more God can move and the less that demons can mess around and find open
59:38
doors to mess around in the house of God so but you know it can be a problem
59:44
where some people have like I really want to cast out demons like not like that's their heart more than I want
59:50
God's will to be done I want to be obedient to God's order and they can start praying for people out of of order
59:57
um after the church service ended when God has done what he has wanted to do when really demons have left sometimes
1:00:04
they it just hasn't manifested yet sometimes they're still in the process of being delivered the anointing is still working or it's just what God
1:00:10
wanted to do for that day and so that's why I say this is also so important that we have this in our heart um not so much
1:00:16
focused on like being a minister because that's when these things can come that's
1:00:22
when um these these these Miss steps out of God's order can come Hallelujah well
1:00:31
I want to declare over you all that this fire would burn and burn more that it
1:00:37
would increase in jesus' name I speak protection over you protection over you
1:00:42
in the spiritual realm any kind of attacks of the enemy that's tried to come in your life I declare them to be
1:00:49
removed now and I declare Victory after Victory after Victory after victory fire
1:00:57
to increase and increase and increase with every day in jesus' name Revival is
1:01:05
now the wave of Revival is here let it grow in your life with every moment and
1:01:12
may you see it touch your family members may you see it touch people all over
1:01:17
your life in your workplace in your city in jesus' name amen hallelujah
