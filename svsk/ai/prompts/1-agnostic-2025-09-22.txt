Develop a React component library for creating interactive assessment rubrics and scaffolding tools for Swedish gymnasium teachers. Include components for: dynamic rubric builders with customizable criteria and progression levels, student self-assessment sliders with confidence ratings, peer feedback collection systems, and portfolio evidence trackers. The library should support offline functionality for schools with limited internet, export assessment data to Excel/Google Sheets formats, and include accessibility features following WCAG guidelines. Add multilingual support for Swedish/English interfaces and customizable themes that align with different school branding requirements.
