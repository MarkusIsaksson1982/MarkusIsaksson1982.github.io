I've selected the sixth prompt: *"Create a micro app for ARTI education emphasizing Level 1’s focus on ‘vikten av data och datakvalitet’. Build a CSV data quality checker that: (1) reports missing values, duplicates, and label balance; (2) uses Python with pandas; (3) outputs a structured text report with both numbers and simple text-based visualizations (e.g., bar-style asterisk counts for distributions); (4) includes at least one ethical discussion question (‘How might unbalanced data lead to unfair AI outcomes?’); (5) provide a command-line usage example so students can run it themselves. Keep the app small, clear, and discussion-oriented."*

### Micro App: CSV Data Quality Checker

#### Educational Tie-in
This app focuses on "vikten av data och datakvalitet" from Level 1 ARTI curriculum, highlighting how data quality impacts AI outcomes. It ties into themes like data-driven decision-making and ethical considerations in AI.

#### App Description
The CSV Data Quality Checker is a command-line Python app that analyzes a CSV file for:
- Missing values
- Duplicate rows
- Class label balance (for the last column, assuming it's a classification target)

#### Code

```python
import pandas as pd
import sys

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python data_quality_checker.py <path_to_csv>")
        return

    csv_path = sys.argv[1]
    try:
        df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading CSV: {e}")
        return

    # 1. Missing values
    missing_count = df.isnull().sum().sum()
    missing_per_column = df.isnull().sum()

    # 2. Duplicates
    duplicate_count = df.duplicated().sum()

    # 3. Label balance (for last column)
    label_column = df.columns[-1]
    label_counts = df[label_column].value_counts()

    # Output report
    print("=== Data Quality Report ===")
    print(f"Total rows: {len(df)}")
    print(f"Total columns: {len(df.columns)}")
    print("\n--- Missing Values ---")
    print(f"Total missing values: {missing_count}")
    for col, count in missing_per_column.items():
        if count > 0:
            print(f"{col}: {count} missing")

    print("\n--- Duplicates ---")
    print(f"Duplicate rows: {duplicate_count}")

    print("\n--- Label Balance ---")
    print(f"Target column: {label_column}")
    for label, count in label_counts.items():
        bar = '*' * (count // 10)  # Scale down for visibility
        print(f"{label}: {count} | {bar}")

    # Ethical discussion prompt
    print("\n--- Reflection ---")
    print("How might unbalanced data (as seen above) lead to unfair AI outcomes?")
    print("Consider: If one class is much smaller, the AI might learn to ignore it or make more errors for that group.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Example Usage
Run the script from the command line:
```bash
python data_quality_checker.py example_data.csv
```

Assuming `example_data.csv` contains:
```
feature1,feature2,label
1,2,A
3,,A
4,5,B
4,5,B
,7,C
```

The output might look like:
```
=== Data Quality Report ===
Total rows: 5
Total columns: 3

--- Missing Values ---
Total missing values: 2
feature2: 1 missing
feature1: 1 missing

--- Duplicates ---
Duplicate rows: 1

--- Label Balance ---
Target column: label
A: 2 | **
B: 2 | **
C: 1 | *

--- Reflection ---
How might unbalanced data (as seen above) lead to unfair AI outcomes?
Consider: If one class is much smaller, the AI might learn to ignore it or make more errors for that group.
```

#### Extension Ideas for Students
1. Modify the script to handle non-numeric missing values (e.g., "N/A").
2. Add a check for outliers in numeric columns.
3. Visualize missing values per column using a heatmap (text-based or with a simple plotting library).
4. Research real-world cases where poor data quality led to biased AI systems.

This micro app is designed to be small, clear, and discussion-oriented, fitting the ARTI curriculum's emphasis on data quality and ethical AI considerations.
