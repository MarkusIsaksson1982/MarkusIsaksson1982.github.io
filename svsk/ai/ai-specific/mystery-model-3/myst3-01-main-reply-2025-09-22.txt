# Assessment Rubric Component Library for Swedish Gymnasium Teachers

## Overview

This React component library is designed to help Swedish gymnasium teachers create interactive assessment rubrics and scaffolding tools. The library includes components for dynamic rubric builders, student self-assessment sliders, peer feedback collection systems, and portfolio evidence trackers. It supports offline functionality, exports assessment data to Excel/Google Sheets formats, and follows WCAG guidelines for accessibility. The library also includes multilingual support for Swedish/English interfaces and customizable themes for different school branding requirements.

## Component Library Structure

The component library is structured into several modules, each addressing a specific requirement:

1. **Rubric Builder**: A dynamic form builder for creating customizable assessment rubrics with criteria and progression levels.
2. **Self-Assessment Slider**: A slider component for students to rate their confidence and understanding of specific criteria.
3. **Peer Feedback Collector**: A form component for collecting peer feedback with ratings and comments.
4. **Portfolio Tracker**: A component for tracking and displaying student portfolio evidence.
5. **Data Export**: A utility for exporting assessment data to Excel/Google Sheets formats.
6. **Accessibility Provider**: A wrapper component ensuring WCAG compliance across the library.
7. **Theme Provider**: A wrapper component for customizable themes aligning with school branding.
8. **Language Provider**: A wrapper component for multilingual support (Swedish/English).

## Implementation Details

The library is built using React, with each component designed to be modular and reusable. State management is handled using React Context or a state management library like Redux or MobX. The library leverages modern React features such as Hooks and Context API for efficient state management and component composition.

For offline functionality, the library uses a combination of IndexedDB for data storage and a service worker for asset caching. The service worker is configured using Workbox or a similar tool to precache assets and handle network requests.

Data export functionality is implemented using libraries like `xlsx` for Excel exports and Google Sheets API for direct integration. The library handles data formatting and validation to ensure accurate exports.

Accessibility is ensured by following WCAG guidelines, using tools like `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` for linting, and testing with screen readers and accessibility testing tools.

Multilingual support is achieved using `i18next` or a similar translation library, with translations managed in JSON files or a translation management system.

Customizable themes are implemented using CSS variables and a theme provider component that allows context-based theme switching. A theme builder tool is included, allowing users to generate custom themes via a visual interface.

## Getting Started

To use the Assessment Rubric Component Library, follow these steps:

1.  Install the library using npm or yarn: `npm install assessment-rubric-library` or `yarn add assessment-rubric-library`.
2.  Import the required components into your React project.
3.  Wrap your application with the `AccessibilityProvider`, `ThemeProvider`, and `LanguageProvider` to enable accessibility features, customizable themes, and multilingual support.
4.  Use the components to build your assessment tools, such as rubrics, self-assessment sliders, peer feedback collectors, and portfolio trackers.
5.  Configure offline functionality and data export options as needed.

## Example Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { RubricBuilder, SelfAssessmentSlider, PeerFeedbackCollector, PortfolioTracker, AccessibilityProvider, ThemeProvider, LanguageProvider } from 'assessment-rubric-library';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <AccessibilityProvider>
      <ThemeProvider theme="default">
        <LanguageProvider language="sv">
          <RubricBuilder />
          <SelfAssessmentSlider criteria="Mathematics" />
          <PeerFeedbackCollector assignmentId="12345" />
          <PortfolioTracker studentId="67890" />
        </LanguageProvider>
      </ThemeProvider>
    </AccessibilityProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```
