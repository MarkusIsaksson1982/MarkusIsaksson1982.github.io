Of course. I'll create a Python script that can extract and analyze Swedish curriculum documents from Skolverket. This script will identify knowledge requirements (kunskapskrav), categorize them by grade, and suggest connections to other subjects.

Here are the files I'll generate for you:

curriculum_parser.py: The main Python script to perform the analysis.

config.json: A configuration file to manage subject keyword mappings for creating "bridge connections."

requirements.txt: A file listing the necessary Python libraries to run the script.

README.md: A documentation file explaining how to set up and use the script.

I have created the complete set of files for you.

To get started, save these files in the same directory. Then, you'll need to install the required Python library using the requirements.txt file and run the main script as described in the README.md. The script will prompt you for the location of a Skolverket PDF, and it will generate the parsed data in an output folder.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further modifications!
