Religion 


The subject of religion has its scientific roots primarily in the academic discipline of 
religious studies, and is by its nature interdisciplinary. It deals with how religions 
and outlooks on life are expressed in words and action, and how people formulate 
and relate to ethical and existential issues. The subject covers the importance of 
belief and ethics for an individual's experience of meaning and belonging. 

Aim of the subject 


Teaching in the subject of religion should aim at helping students broaden, deepen 
and develop knowledge of religions, outlooks on life and ethical standpoints, and 
where applicable different interpretations of these. Knowledge and understanding 
of Christianity and its traditions are of special importance since this tradition has 
nurtured the values underpinning the foundations of Swedish society. Teaching 
should take as its starting point a view of society characterised by openness regard-
ing lifestyle, outlooks on life, differences between people, and also give students the 
opportunity to develop a preparedness for understanding and living in a society 
characterised by diversity. Students should also be given the opportunity to discuss 
how the relationship between religion and science can be interpreted and under-
stood, regarding, for example, questions about creation and evolution. 

Teaching should lead to students developing knowledge of how people's moral 
attitudes can be understood on the basis of religions and outlooks on life. They 
should be given the opportunity to reflect on and analyse people's values and be-
liefs, and thus develop respect and understanding for different ways of thinking 
and living. Teaching should also give students the opportunity to analyse and assess 
how religion can relate, amongst other things, to ethnicity, gender, sexuality and 
socio-economic background. 

Teaching should give students the opportunity to analyse texts and concepts, criti-
cally examine sources, discuss and argue. 

Teaching in the subject of religion should give students the opportunities 
to develop the following: 

1) The ability to analyse religions and outlooks on life based on different 
interpretations and perspectives. 
2) Knowledge of human identity in relation to religions and outlooks on 
life. 
3) Knowledge of different views on the relationships between religion and 
science, and the ability to analyse these. 
4) The ability to use ethical concepts, theories and models. 



5) The ability to examine and analyse ethical issues in relation to 
Christianity, other religions and outlooks on life.
