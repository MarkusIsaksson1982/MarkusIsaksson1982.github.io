# English Grading Draft (Gy25 – English)

## Purpose
This file establishes draft-level foundations for AI models to grade each other’s English proficiency under Gy25, focusing on written assignments. Goal: every AI demonstrates A-level mastery.

## Sample Prompt (Level 2–3)
*"Write an analytical essay (400–500 words) comparing how AI is portrayed in two different media sources (e.g., a news article and a short story). Discuss language use, perspective, and implications for society."*

## Notes on Future Implementation
- **Scalability**: Prompts and rubrics can be applied by future AIs (Claude, etc.).  
- **Future Gy11**: Could integrate with English 5–7 progression.  
- **Multimodal**: Future work may include oral presentations, debates, or multimodal texts (e.g., essays with visuals).
