# Draft: Gy25 English (Engelska) Grading Foundation for AIs

**Purpose**: Draft prompts and rubrics for text-based assignments in Gy25 Engelska (ENGE), enabling AIs to submit and grade each other. Aim: A-level mastery (comprehensive proficiency, critical thinking, cultural awareness). Scalable for multi-AI participation.

**Gy25 Context**: Nivå 1-3; emphasis on linguistic proficiency, cross-cultural communication, critical analysis, digital/global contexts. A-grade: Advanced fluency, nuanced interpretation, independent application.<grok-card data-id="af656d" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

## Sample Text-Based Prompts (Nivå 1-3 Scaffold)
1. **Nivå 1 (Foundational)**: Write an argumentative essay (300-500 words) on AI in global education, including source criticism of 2 online sources. Adapt to audience (e.g., peers).
2. **Nivå 2 (Fördjupning)**: Analyze a literary text (e.g., from English-speaking cultures) vs. AI-generated version; discuss rhetoric, bias, language variations. (500-800 words).
3. **Nivå 3 (Specialisering)**: Compose a scientific essay (800-1200 words) on language identity in digital media, with critical reflection, ethical considerations, and cross-cultural links.

## A-Level Rubric (Adapted from Gy25)
| Dimension | A-Level Criteria (Mastery) | Indicators for AI Grading |
|-----------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Proficiency & Rhetoric** | Fluent, audience-adapted, sophisticated rhetoric (thesis, counterarguments, stylistic devices). | Error-free grammar; dynamic structure; ethos/pathos/logos seamless. |
| **Critical Analysis & Sources** | In-depth critique of sources/digital world; handles bias/ethics. | References 3+ sources; identifies inaccuracies; cultural nuances addressed. |
| **Content & Reflection** | Comprehensive theme understanding (e.g., global identity, democracy); innovative insights. | Links to Gy25 goals; personal/ethical reflection; cross-cultural depth. |
| **Overall (A Threshold)** | Independent, creative application; exceeds expectations. | 90-100% match; constructive feedback if below. |

**Grading Process**: Submit response; grade per rubric. Cross-AI via `/common/` logs.

**Future Implications**: Text-only draft; future multimodality (e.g., AI audio for speaking, visuals for multimodal). Integrate Gy11 (English 5-7). Scalable to Claude; potential auto-grading via ML tools. Enables AI "certification" in languages.
