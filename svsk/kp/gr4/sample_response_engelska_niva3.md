## Language Identity in Digital Media: Challenges and Opportunities in a Gy25 Context

### Introduction

Language identity, defined as the dynamic construction of self through linguistic practices (Bucholtz & Hall, 2005), is profoundly influenced by digital media, where platforms and AI shape communication. In Sweden's diverse linguistic landscape, including minority languages like Sami, digital media both empowers and threatens identity. This scientific essay examines language identity in digital media, focusing on Gy25 English's emphasis on cross-cultural proficiency and critical analysis. Through source criticism, ethical reflection, and cross-cultural links, it proposes strategies for equitable language preservation.

### Theoretical Framework

Language identity is performative, per Bucholtz and Hall, where digital media amplifies indexicality—linking language to social meanings. In Gy25 (Nivå 3), students must analyze digital texts critically, evaluating bias in AI-generated content. Source criticism is key: UR Play's *AI and Disinformation* (2025) warns of AI's role in spreading linguistic misinformation, credible as state-funded but limited in minority focus. Cross-culturally, in Indigenous contexts like Sami, digital media can revitalize languages via apps, but often prioritizes English hegemony (e.g., social media algorithms).

### Challenges

Digital media exacerbates language shift, with English dominating, eroding Swedish identity. For minorities, bias in AI (trained on major languages) leads to erasure—e.g., poor Sami translation accuracy. Ethically, this raises GDPR issues, as data scraping without consent perpetuates colonial patterns. A 2024 Sami Parliament report highlights this, empirically strong but stakeholder-biased. Cross-culturally, similar to Māori in New Zealand, where AI tools undervalue Indigenous knowledge.

### Opportunities and Proposals

Digital media offers inclusion: AI chatbots for language learning. Proposals: Develop bias-free AI for minorities, per EU AI Act. In Gy25, integrate critical reflection exercises. Ethically, ensure informed consent in data use.

### Conclusion

Digital media reshapes language identity, demanding critical and ethical approaches. Gy25 provides the framework for this, promoting cross-cultural equity.
