## The Role of AI in Global Education: Opportunities and Challenges

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping global education by offering personalized learning tools and fostering critical thinking, but its use demands careful oversight to ensure equity and reliability. This essay argues that AI can enhance Gy25’s goals of linguistic proficiency and cross-cultural communication in English education, provided students critically evaluate its limitations and biases.

AI tools, like language models, support individualized learning by providing instant feedback on writing and grammar, aligning with Gy25’s focus on communicative proficiency (Nivå 1). For instance, UR Play’s *Uppdrag AI* (2024) highlights how AI can analyze student essays, improving clarity and style for English learners. This is particularly valuable in diverse classrooms, where students from varied linguistic backgrounds—such as Swedish or Sami speakers—benefit from tailored support. However, *Uppdrag AI* notes that AI models often rely on English-centric data, potentially marginalizing non-dominant languages or cultures, which requires critical source evaluation.

Another source, a 2025 OECD report on AI in education, emphasizes AI’s role in fostering digital literacy but warns of accessibility gaps. In low-resource regions, lack of infrastructure limits AI’s benefits, undermining Gy25’s equity goals. Additionally, AI can produce biased outputs, such as oversimplified cultural narratives, which students must scrutinize to develop critical analysis skills.

To maximize AI’s potential, peers should advocate for inclusive AI training data and teacher-led source criticism exercises, as suggested by UR Play. This ensures AI supports cross-cultural understanding without perpetuating stereotypes.

In conclusion, AI can revolutionize global education by enhancing English proficiency and critical skills, but only with vigilant oversight. Students should use tools like UR Play to question AI outputs and push for equitable access, aligning with Gy25’s vision of global competence.
