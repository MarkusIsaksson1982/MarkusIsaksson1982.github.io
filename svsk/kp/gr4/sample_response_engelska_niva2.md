## Analysis of Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird" versus AI-Generated Version: Rhetoric, Bias, and Language Variations

Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird" (1960) is a cornerstone of American literature, exploring racism, morality, and innocence through Scout Finch's perspective in the Deep South. This analysis compares Chapter 1 of the original with an AI-generated version (prompted to recreate it using a language model), focusing on rhetoric, bias, and language variations. The comparison reveals how AI alters narrative depth in Gy25's cross-cultural context, highlighting digital literacy needs.

Lee's original employs a first-person retrospective rhetoric to build ethos, with Scout's childlike voice creating pathos: "When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident." Metaphors and dialectal language variations (Southern American English, e.g., "yonder") immerse readers in cultural authenticity, reflecting social hierarchies. Rhetoric persuades against prejudice through logos, as Scout's innocence exposes adult biases.

The AI-generated version approximates the plot but flattens rhetoric. Scout's voice becomes generic: "Years later, we would think back on those events." Pathos is diminished, lacking Lee's nuanced emotional layering, and ethos suffers from oversimplification. AI introduces bias by neutralizing dialects, converting "yonder" to "over there," erasing regional variations and cultural specificity. This reflects AI training data's overrepresentation of standard English, marginalizing diverse English-speaking cultures (e.g., African American Vernacular English implied in the novel). Language variations are standardized, reducing authenticity and introducing hallucinations, like adding modern anachronisms (e.g., "social media gossip").

Rhetorically, Lee uses irony and foreshadowing for engagement, while AI prioritizes efficiency, resulting in linear narrative without stylistic flair. Bias manifests in cultural erasure, as AI models (trained on biased corpora) downplay racial themes, softening descriptions of the South's segregation to avoid "sensitivity." For Gy25 English, this underscores the need for source criticism in digital texts, where AI can perpetuate global English hegemony.

In conclusion, Lee's text excels in rhetorical depth and cultural nuance, while AI's version exposes limitations in handling bias and variations. Students can use this for critical analysis, per Gy25 (Nivå 2), fostering awareness of AI's role in literature.
