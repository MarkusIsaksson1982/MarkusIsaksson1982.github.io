### Fractal Heartbeat
Type anything — the canvas beats to your actual keystroke rhythm.  
Every pulse grows fractal branches. The more you type, the more intricate the pattern becomes.  
Optimized for long sessions (no memory leaks, smooth even after hours).  
Runs 100% locally, single file, no dependencies.
