# Language-Special: General Language Processing Tools

This special category contains language-agnostic tools for text processing, useful across multiple languages for educational purposes.

## Contents

- `swedish_argument_analyzer.py`: Analyzes arguments in Swedish text for structure and balance.
- `swedish_citation_validator.py`: Validates citations in Swedish texts, robust or simple mode.
- `language_task_manager.py`: Command-line task manager for language learning tasks.

## Usage

Run scripts directly with Python:

- `python swedish_argument_analyzer.py` (includes example)

These tools support Swedish language education, focusing on argumentation, source criticism, and organization.
