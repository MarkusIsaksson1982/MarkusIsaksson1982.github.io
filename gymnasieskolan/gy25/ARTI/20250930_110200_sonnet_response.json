  "summary": "Excellent implementation of `_consult_architect` method. The code is production-ready, well-structured, and adheres to our established protocol. Unit tests are comprehensive and demonstrate proper validation. Minor recommendations provided for enhancement and one critical observation about error handling approach.",
  
  "primary_recommendation": {
    "approach": "Deploy the current implementation as-is for Phase 1, with minor enhancements to error handling granularity and ConversationHistory placeholder.",
    "rationale": "Your implementation successfully translates the architectural design into working code. The method signature, TCP construction, file operations, and error handling all align with our specifications. The code demonstrates good Python practices with type hints, clear docstrings, and robust error handling. The unit tests validate all critical functionality.",
    "implementation_steps": [
      "Current code is ready for immediate use in Phase 1",
      "Consider implementing the minor enhancements listed in 'alternatives' section",
      "Expand ConversationHistory class when moving beyond placeholder phase",
