Analyze the current state of the Flask-based Swedish language learning app at "C:\Users\mjisa\dev\app", which includes modules for reading comprehension assignments, novella writing and analysis, CEFR text modification, AI-driven feedback, and user dashboards. Suggest further development ideas to enhance functionality, user engagement, scalability, and educational impact. Focus on:

- New modules or features (e.g., speaking/pronunciation, collaborative writing, gamification).
- Integration of advanced AI (e.g., real-time LLM for conversations, personalized learning paths).
- UI/UX improvements (e.g., mobile app, accessibility, interactive visualizations).
- Data analytics and teacher tools (e.g., progress reports, adaptive difficulty).
- Security, performance, and deployment enhancements (e.g., cloud hosting, multi-language support).
- Alignment with Swedish curriculum (Gy25, CEFR) and research-based pedagogy.

Provide detailed proposals, code snippets for key features, architectural changes, and a roadmap with priorities. Ensure suggestions build on existing components like TextProcessor, blueprints, and models.
