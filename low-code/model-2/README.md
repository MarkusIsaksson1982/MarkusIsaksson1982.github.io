Ethical AI & Cyber Safety Learning Hub
A low-code, AI-assisted sample app I can realistically help you build end-to-end

Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a useful, modular web application with minimal manual coding by combining:
- AI-assisted development (prompt-driven scaffolding, pair-programming, review)
- Low-code practices (reusable components, prebuilt UI kits, code generators)
- A pragmatic, well-supported web stack I can reliably suggest and improve

Theme: Ethical AI and cyber safety education. The app helps users understand risks of malicious AI use, benefits of ethical practices, and learn via interactive quizzes, resources, and simple simulations.

What I can realistically produce and maintain
- Frontend and full-stack TypeScript using Next.js (React) with Tailwind and shadcn/ui
- Forms and validation (react-hook-form + zod)
- Data models and simple persistence (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres) or file/MDX-based content
- Next.js API routes/Route Handlers and Server Actions
- Client-side data fetching (SWR or TanStack Query) when useful
- Basic auth (NextAuth.js) if needed
- Accessibility, security, testing, and deployment guidance

Project Goals
1) Demonstrate AI-assisted productivity
- Use multiple AI models (via Model Playground) to propose, compare, and refine components and architecture
- Replace boilerplate authoring with prompt-driven scaffolding and iterative review

2) Deliver a low-code educational app
- Modular Next.js app with reusable UI sections
- Navigation, quizzes, feedback forms, resources hub
- Clear patterns and rapid iteration

3) Highlight employable skills
- Translate abstract requirements into production-ready UI and APIs
- Component-driven development with cloud-ready patterns
- Balance AI automation with human review for accessibility, privacy, and security

Tech Stack (realistic for my assistance)
- Framework and Language: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript
- Styling and UI: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui (Radix UI under the hood), responsive layout utilities
- Routing and Data Fetching:
  - App Router with React Server Components for static/dynamic content
  - Route Handlers (app/api) and optional Server Actions for mutations
  - SWR (lightweight) or TanStack Query for client-side caching where needed
- Forms and Validation: react-hook-form + zod
- Content: MDX for educational pages; optional CMS later
- Persistence (optional):
  - Prisma + SQLite for local/dev; upgrade to Postgres in production
  - OR file-based storage for a zero-DB demo
- Auth (optional): NextAuth.js (email/passwordless or OAuth providers)
- Notifications: shadcn/ui toast or sonner
- Testing and Quality: ESLint, Prettier, Playwright (E2E), Jest/RTL (unit)
- Deployment: Vercel or any Node-capable host; supports edge or serverless
- AI-Assisted Workflow: Model Playground for multi-model ideation, code review, and refactors

Features
- Landing Page
  - Hero, clear value proposition, and navigation
  - Sections: Ethics, Protection Tips, Showcase, Resources, Blog (MDX)
- Interactive Quiz
  - Multiple-choice with instant feedback via toast
  - Extensible question banks (JSON/MDX or DB)
  - Optional progress tracking (localStorage or DB)
- Feedback System
  - Suggestion form with validation (zod) and confirmation toast
  - Optional server-side moderation endpoint
- Resources Hub
  - Curated links to cyber safety resources, hotlines, reporting portals
  - Tag-based filtering; MDX-backed for easy curation
- 404 with a Twist
  - Friendly error state plus a small “spot the phishing signal” tip
- Accessibility and Security
  - Radix primitives for accessible components
  - Form validation, basic rate limiting (middleware) for APIs
  - Optional content moderation rules

Low-Code and AI Workflow
- AI as co-developer: Use prompts to scaffold components (Hero, Quiz, Feedback), pages, and MDX structure
- Compare and merge: Leverage multiple models in Model Playground to produce parallel implementations; pick best patterns
- Human-in-the-loop: I’ll outline accessibility, security, and performance checks at each step

Example workflow
1) Prompt: “Create a QuizSection with 5 multiple-choice questions, accessible radios, and toast feedback.”
2) Refine: “Add zod validation, keyboard nav, and show correct explanations.”
3) Integrate: “Wire QuizSection to a /api/quiz/submit route; log anonymized results.”
4) Review: “Check a11y (labels, roles), rate-limit POST, and add tests.”

Suggested folder structure (App Router)
- app/
  - layout.tsx, page.tsx (landing), not-found.tsx (404 with tip)
  - ethics/page.mdx
  - protection/page.mdx
  - showcase/page.tsx
  - resources/page.tsx
  - quiz/page.tsx
  - feedback/page.tsx
  - api/
    - feedback/route.ts (POST)
    - quiz/submit/route.ts (POST)
- components/
  - ui/* (shadcn/ui)
  - Hero.tsx, Section.tsx, QuizSection.tsx, FeedbackForm.tsx, ResourceCard.tsx
- lib/
  - validations.ts (zod schemas)
  - analytics.ts (optional)
  - rateLimit.ts (middleware helper)
- content/
  - resources/*.mdx
  - blog/*.mdx
- prisma/ (optional)
  - schema.prisma
- tests/
  - e2e/*
  - unit/*

Data model (optional with Prisma)
- Feedback: id, message, category, contact (optional), createdAt
- QuizResult: id, userId (optional), score, answers (JSON), createdAt
- Resource: id, title, url, tags[]

I can provide concrete Prisma schema, migrations, and route handlers on request.

Potential extensions
- Gamification: Badges, shareable certificates for quiz milestones
- Dynamic content: Pull resources from a CMS or public APIs
- Community reporting: Form to submit phishing attempts (with moderation)
- Analytics dashboard: Aggregate quiz results and common misconceptions
- Localization: i18n via next-intl or lingui
- Auth-enabled features: Saved progress, personalized recommendations

Security and privacy notes
- Minimize PII collection; keep feedback anonymous by default
- Add server-side zod validation and simple rate limiting to POST routes
- Provide a transparent Privacy page describing data usage and retention
- Optional content moderation: start with rules-based filters; AI moderation can be added cautiously

Why this matters for employment
- Practical proficiency with modern full-stack TypeScript (Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/ui)
- AI fluency: use multiple models to ideate, scaffold, and review code effectively
- Product mindset: ethical, user-centered feature set with accessibility and security
- Clear documentation and maintainable patterns for team environments

What I will deliver quickly
- A working Next.js app with the pages and components above
- Quiz and feedback flows with validation and toasts
- MDX-based content system and resource listing
- Optional persistence layer and API endpoints
- Setup scripts, linting, and basic tests
