Analyze the current state of the expanded Flask-based Swedish language learning app at "C:\Users\mjisa\dev\app", now including modules for reading assignments, novella writing/analysis, speaking/pronunciation, AI chat, and personalized paths. Suggest additional development ideas to enhance functionality, user engagement, scalability, and educational impact. Focus on:

- Emerging technologies (e.g., VR/AR for immersive learning, blockchain for certifications).
- Advanced pedagogies (e.g., AI tutors, peer learning networks, cultural integration).
- Global expansion (e.g., multi-language support, international curricula).
- Sustainability and ethics (e.g., data privacy, inclusive design, long-term maintenance).
- Integration with external tools (e.g., Google Classroom, Duolingo APIs).

Provide detailed proposals, code snippets for key features, architectural changes, and an updated roadmap with priorities. Ensure suggestions align with CEFR, Gy25, and modern SLA research.
