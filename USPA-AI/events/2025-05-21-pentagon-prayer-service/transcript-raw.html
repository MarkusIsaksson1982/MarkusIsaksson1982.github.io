    <p>good morning
welcome to this inaugural prayer and
worship service secretary
degth wanted to bring us all together so
that we could praise and worship
together and it's a full house welcome
to everyone who who's joining us both
here and online uh down at norfolk south
we welcome our our brothers and sisters
there who can't join us in person uh but
we're thrilled to have them uh viewing
and and watching as well would you stand
with me for the
invocation father
god we start this service reflecting on
the words that the psalmist king david
wrote blessed is the lord my rock who
trains my hands for war and my fingers
for battle he is my steadfast love and
my
fortress my
stronghold my
deliverer my shield and he in whom i
take refuge father we give you thanks
for being our rock and our
fortress for being our deliverer for
sending jesus to be our our savior
father were we to walk through this life
on our own in our own strength and our
own wisdom it would be for not but
father because you walk with us and
empower us uh we can walk as your
ambassadors in this world father we pray
that you would anoint the speaker this
morning pastor burks father would you
bless him and the words you've placed on
his heart father may our ears be open to
hear that we would be encouraged and
that our cups would overflow so that
those around us would receive your love
we pray these things in the mighty name
of jesus amen you may be seated
secretary hegsth's faith is important to
him and he wanted to bring us together
and and so he's put this together so
that we can do this on a monthly basis
to come in and pray and hear a word and
be encouraged for a brief part of our
week so that we could go forth
encouraged so secretary hegsth thanks so
much
well colonel thank you very much um let
me say something briefly as i look out
at this
audience this is precisely where i need
to be and i think exactly where we need
to be as a nation at this moment uh in
prayer on bended knee recognizing the
providence of our lord and savior jesus
christ uh that there are so many things
we do in this building and across this
nation with such great consequence it's
almost infathomable when i think about
the task that i've even undertaken thus
far this morning and what i'll partake
in the remainder of the day to think it
relies only on my strength uh would
leave me completely incapable of
addressing the issues of the day or
those going forward and knowing that
there's an author in heaven uh
overseeing all of this who's
underwritten all of it for us on the
cross uh gives me the strength to
proceed uh and to look out at this
audience and know there are so many
others online here at the defense
department who share that understanding
of appealing to
heaven uh for that guidance for that
wisdom for that courage uh gives me
strength so thank you for joining us
today this is something we plan to do uh
on a monthly basis on a voluntary basis
here in the auditorium hope you'll uh
let those you work with know about it um
we're grateful that you would join us
here briefly it's just a brief moment uh
but pausing and creating that routine of
prayer of humility of seeking his grace
and his guidance just like george
washington did on bended knee in the
most difficult moments with his troops
in impossible
circumstances saying "lord god i cannot
do it alone." so thank you for joining
us here uh and we look forward to doing
it each month if you would bow your head
in prayer with
me uh king
jesus we come humbly before you seeking
your
face seeking your
grace in humble
obedience to your law and to your word
we come as sinners saved only by that
grace seeking your providence in our
lives and in our nation
lord god we ask for the wisdom to see
what is right and in each and every day
and each and every circumstance the
courage to do what is right in obedience
to your will it is in the name of our
lord and savior jesus christ that we
pray and all god's people said "amen."
amen thank you well it is a privilege
and we're moving this along it's a half
hour we're in the middle of a workday
but it is the and we're going to rotate
ministers that we bring in to give brief
remarks it's a privilege for me to
introduce uh pastor brooks podiger who
is the pastor of my church back in
tennessee where we attended before we
came here pilgrim hill reform fellowship
uh he has long been a mentor of mine of
my wife and i of our family uh and uh
just a
a
bibleelbelieving rocksteady
uh minister christian man family man uh
who you know we were in bible studies
together there long before anything like
this uh seemed possible and now here we
are um so he asking him to come up and
give a a brief uh sermon ladies and
gentlemen i welcome brooks podiger
thank you
well thank you secretary hegsth it's
been an honor to stand by your side
these past couple years in christian
fellowship and what an honor to stand
before this podium today it is seems
surreal to think of some of our prayer
meetings last year outside of
goodletsville tennessee city hall
sometimes just me and you 6 a.m praying
the blessing of the lord upon this
nation and my goodness do we not pray to
a god who hears amen do you military
service members and civilian staff who
carry out this most important mission at
this most important building i bring you
not only the warmest greetings but the
deepest gratitude from the saints of
pilgrim hill reformed where i get the
privilege of serving as
pastor america's first commander and
chief george washington whose memorial
whose memorial fittingly is a a massive
arrow pointing to heaven said this in
1789 it is the duty of all nations to
acknowledge the providence of almighty
god to obey his will to be grateful for
his benefits and to humbly implore his
protection and his favor so we have come
today to heed this wise council from
washington so if you would now please
join me in earnest
prayer gracious and almighty god of
heaven we come to you humbly as befits a
king for as your word says in psalm
22:28 "kingsship belongs to the lord and
he alone rules over the nations." but we
also come boldly for we come in the name
of our faithful high priest even jesus
christ our lord we thank you for this
great land that you have given to us and
this great nation to be our home and our
place we pray for our leaders who you
have sovereignly appointed for president
trump thank you for the way that you
have used him to bring stability and
moral clarity to our land and we pray
that you would continue to protect him
bless him give him great wisdom we pray
that you would surround him with
faithful counselors who fear your name
and love your
precepts for all of our war fighters and
for all who fall under the banner of the
dod whether in this room or not of every
station and every rank we thank you for
them we lift them up to you as well we
pray that you would use them as an
instrument in your hands to be a
blessing of protection first and
foremost to our nation but also to the
nations of the world may our strength
and our readiness be used wisely to
promote peace for all who would have
peace and may it cause those who thrive
on terror throughout the world may it
cause them to stand in fear and to
abandon their wicked intentions
we lift up the families of our military
service members oh god we pray that you
would remember them that you would
reward them for the unseen sacrifice
they make daily grant them the peace
that only your holy spirit can bring we
pray that you would supply for every
need that they have f physical and
relational and spiritual and emotional
lastly we pray for the secretary's
christian prayer service as an event
you have declared in your word that if
my people who are called by my name
would humble themselves if they would
pray if they would seek my face if they
would turn from
wickedness then you would hear from
heaven and you would forgive their sin
and you would bring healing upon their
land so lord may this become a place
where christians come together to do
just this may we see you move in power
not just through the pentagon but
through our nation's capital and down
throughout this great nation we pray
that you would bring repentance where we
have sinned that you would bring the
balm of peace where we need healing that
you would give the gospel to all who are
in need of the grace of our lord jesus
christ which is indeed all of us and we
pray all of these things in the name
that is above all names even our lord
jesus who lives and reigns with you in
the unity of the holy spirit and all of
god's people said and amen won't you
rise with me and we'll sing amazing
grace we don't have any background music
but i've been told that the military
knows how to sing and so prove me
right
amazing grace how sweet the sound that
saved a wretch like
[Music]
me i once was lost but now am
found was blind but now i see
it was grace that taught my heart to
fear and grace my
fears
relieved how
preious did that
grace
appear the hour i first believe in the
final verse now when we've been there
10,000
years bright
shining as the
[Music]
sun we have no less days to sing god's
praise than
when we had
beun and amen and you may be seated
thank you well i do want to take a few
minutes now to encourage you from the
word of god and specifically from a text
that you may already know my text for
today is psalm
46:10 which says "be still and know that
i am god." by a show of hands who has
heard that text before be still and know
that i am god pretty much all of us and
for good reason it is an immensely
comforting verse but i wonder do you
know its actual context i wonder that
because psalm 46 is not a psalm about
nature walks and sipping lattes which
you might surmise if you just hear "be
still and know that i'm god without any
context." no quite apart from it psalm
46 is a psalm written by warriors about
being in the midst of war i encourage
you to read the entire psalm when you go
home i don't have time for that but
here's a few verses here's the context
that this exhortation comes from
beginning in verse 8 give careful
attention to the reading of god's word
come behold the works of the lord how he
has brought desolation on the earth or
he makes wars to cease to the ends of
the earth he will break the bow and he
will shatter the spear the lord burns
the chariots with fire be still and know
that i am god i am that god goes on i
will be exalted among the nations i will
be exalted in the earth the lord of
hosts still quoting and whenever you
hear the lord of hosts in the scripture
that means the lord of armies the lord
of hosts is with us the god of jacob is
our
fortress and so the call to be still and
know that i am god is a call to a quiet
attentiveness of soul not sipping a
latte but when the bullets are flying
around your head
the call to be still and know that i am
god is to remember when you feel the
gravity and the burden that you carry
every day to know there is a god in
heaven and you are not him and what a
relief so this exhortation in a very
real way this is not me doing pastoral
origami to fit it into the text i showed
you the text in a very real way this is
an exhortation for you in this room in a
way that us civilians don't understand
it so what about being under the dod
banner makes it especially necessary to
be still and know that the lord is god i
have two observations here and then four
rapid fire exhortations at the end so
i'll get right to work number one the
reason it's a specific word for you is
because of the temptation to think that
you are in complete control here's what
i mean because of the gravity of your
job because of the power of our weapons
because of the weightiness of the
responsibility all the civilian eyes and
the allies eyes on you hoping you'll
help us there's a temptation to think
that you're actually in control and
responsible for final
outcomes especially for those who issue
the commands and do the aiming and the
shooting now you do have a great
responsibility there is no doubt about
that but you are not ultimately in
charge of the world the lord is the lord
is our our lord jesus said in matthew 10
"not a sparrow will fall to the ground
apart from my heavenly father." and if
our lord is sovereign even over the
sparrow's fallings you can be assured
that he is sovereign over everything
else that falls in this world including
tomahawk and minute man missiles
including strategy meetings and war room
debriefings jesus has the final say over
all of it
and this is why david the great warrior
king of israel declared psalm 20:7 "some
will trust in chariots." that's true
some will trust in horses but we will
trust in the name of the lord our god
and so distinguished personnel be still
and know that he is god which means by
necessary
inference you are not and what a relief
you don't have to bear the burden of the
world that's god's responsibility he's
far better at it than you are yours is
to do your duty diligently to do your
duty faithfully to do your duty
excellently to do your duty as unto the
lord as colossians said and then to
trust him to trust him with the final
outcomes of it all he's king and he's
really good at his job the next reason
psalm 46:10 is a an especially important
word for you in this room not just the
temptation to think you're in complete
control but number two the temptation to
think that you're all
alone the temptation to think that
you're all alone it is an honor to be a
part of the military but as you know far
better than i could ever know parts of
your job can feel very isolating as well
the confidential details that you can't
even share with your spouse the coming
deployment that you can't yet even tell
to your kids the you the unique mental
strain the pressure brings the ptsd that
you suffer in silence with which i know
from experience in my own congregation
with service members of the hearing aids
and ptsd and just carry it with them you
know this it must be stared directly in
the face it is an honor to be in your
position but parts of it are isolating
as well is part of the essential
sacrifice and it's when this very real
feeling comes that you need to be still
and know that the lord is god that his
eye is upon you that he walks in lock
step with you every step that you
take hear the words again of a great
warrior king king david when he felt
this psalm 23 even though i i do walk
from time to time through the valley of
the shadow of death that happens even
though i won't fear evil why
because you're with me
in your rod and your staff they comfort
me notice king david king david actively
dwelt meditated sung about these
realities and that's what i want you to
do also and remember if you are a
christian if you have trusted in the
lord jesus christ god is not just god to
you
anymore how did our lord teach us to
pray
our father god has become your father
who loves you with all the love that he
has for his son who knows you in your
fears and your joys and your sins and
your temptations and your marital
conflict far better than you even
understand it and who has promised to
never leave you nor forsake you behold
to be with you even until the end of the
age god is an attentive merciful kind
gracious father who will very soon
receive you into his arms on the final
day so be still and know that that god
is god when you feel the temptation to
believe you're in complete control or
when you feel the temptation to believe
that you are all
alone you are not the lord is with you
he will comfort you in conclusion nice
talk pastor brooks go about my day
get back to the normal routine how do we
actually do this so i'm going to put
something in your hands before we leave
four rapid fire exhortations that i
really can't expand upon but that's okay
four ways that i'm telling you you can
do to purposely be still and know that
the lord is god throughout the day
number one bookend your day with
scripture and prayer book end your day
with scripture and prayer in scripture
you say "i wish i had a word from the
lord." he gave us a really big book it's
called the bible so let god speak to you
first word of the day last word in the
evening and then pray speak back to him
book end your day with scripture and
prayer two have someone in your
spiritual foxhole have someone in your
spiritual foxhole you don't just need
someone to have your back when you are
on the warfield you need someone to have
your back when you're on the spiritual
warfield which is all the time
and i'm not talking about that
platitudes hey brother praying for you
hope things are cool i'm talking about
somebody who's mature and who knows you
who you could actually confess your sin
to and it would be a safe place and say
i i really need specific sin me and my
wife are really struggling i lashed out
at my kids i need to repent and i need
your help have someone in your spiritual
foxhole seek them out look them in the
eyes use words and say "please i need
you to pray for me and with me." god
gives grace to the humble three
prioritize weekly worship there's
nothing more important for the spiritual
health for the christian than the
gathering with the saints on the lord's
day this is where christ meets most
powerfully with his people to strengthen
and encourage us in the gospel to shield
us from the flaming arrows of the evil
one which is why satan doesn't want you
to go
but you will go
you will show up you will prioritize it
whenever physically possible you will
bring your children and you will worship
the living god and you will be still and
know that he is god and fourth and
finally make this monthly gathering
immovable the fact that this service is
happening today is proof that god's
blessing is still on our land despite
our best efforts so show up sing loud
pray fervently and all by faith heed the
wisdom of the great founder samuel adams
when he gave this charge may every
citizen in the army and in the country
have a proper sense of the deity upon
his mind and in impression of that
declaration recorded in the
bible him that honorth me i will honor
four be still and know that i am god our
lord and our god we pray by your spirit
you would impress these things upon us
and now we would pray the way our lord
taught us to pray saying "our father who
art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy
kingdom come thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven give us this day our
daily bread and forgive us our
trespasses as we forgive those who have
trespassed against us lead us not into
temptation but deliver us from evil for
thine is the kingdom the power and the
glory forever and ever and amen and amen
sake of time let us stand and perhaps
read the first and the last verse of a
mighty fortress is that okay
and again i've heard the army can sing
or the military can sing so prove me
right a mighty fortress is our god a
bull work never
failing our helper he amid the flood of
mortal liss
prevailing for still our ancient
foe thus seek to work us
wo his craft and power are
great and armed with
cruel on earth is not easy in the final
verse sing it out that word above all
earthly powers no thanks to them abidth
[Music]
the spirits and the gifts are ours
through him who with us
death let goods and kindred
go this mortal life
also god's journey they may
kill god's truth abideth
still his kingdom is forever
[Music]
may the lord bless you and keep you may
the lord make his face to shine upon you
and be gracious to you may the lord lift
up his countenance upon you and give you
peace and we'll end with the doxology
where i come from we raise our hands for
the doxology so you are welcome to
praise god from whom all blessings
flow praise him all
creatures here
below praise him above ye
heavenly
host praise
father son and
holy
ghost amen
[Music]
and amen and this event has concluded
and you may be
dismissed
appreciate it
