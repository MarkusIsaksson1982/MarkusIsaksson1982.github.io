    <div class="section-header">Opening & Welcome</div>
    
    <div class="speaker">Chaplain/Colonel (Opening Remarks)</div>
    <p>Good morning. Welcome to this inaugural prayer and worship service. Secretary Hegseth wanted to bring us all together so we could praise and worship as one. It's a full house—welcome to everyone joining us here and online, including our brothers and sisters at Norfolk South who cannot join us in person. We're thrilled to have you watching as well. Please stand for the invocation.</p>

    <div class="section-header">Invocation Prayer</div>
    
    <div class="speaker">Chaplain/Colonel (Invocation)</div>
    <div class="prayer">
        <p>Father God,</p>
        <p>We start this service reflecting on the words the psalmist King David wrote: "Blessed is the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war and my fingers for battle. He is my steadfast love and my fortress, my stronghold, my deliverer, my shield, and he in whom I take refuge."</p>
        <p>We give you thanks for being our rock and fortress, for being our deliverer, for sending Jesus to be our Savior.</p>
        <p>Father, if we were to walk through this life in our own strength, it would be for naught. But because you walk with us and empower us, we can go forth as your ambassadors.</p>
        <p>We pray you would anoint the speaker this morning, Pastor Burks. Bless him and the words you've placed on his heart. May our ears be open to hear, that we would be encouraged and that our cups would overflow, so those around us would receive your love.</p>
        <p>We pray these things in the mighty name of Jesus. Amen.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">Secretary Hegseth's Remarks</div>
    
    <div class="speaker">Secretary Pete Hegseth</div>
    <p>You may be seated.</p>
    <p>Thank you, Colonel.</p>
    <p>Let me say briefly: as I look out at this audience, this is precisely where I need to be, and where we need to be as a nation—on bended knee, recognizing the providence of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>There are so many things we do in this building and across the nation with such great consequence, it's almost unfathomable. If I relied only on my own strength, I'd be completely incapable of addressing the issues of the day. Knowing there's an author in heaven overseeing all of this, who has underwritten it for us on the cross, gives me strength.</p>
    <p>Looking out at this audience—so many of you here and online at the Defense Department—sharing that understanding of appealing to heaven for guidance and wisdom gives me strength.</p>
    <p>Thank you for joining us. We plan to do this monthly on a voluntary basis—pause, pray, seek grace and guidance just like George Washington did on bended knee in difficult moments with his troops.</p>
    <p><em>"Lord God, I cannot do it alone."</em></p>
    <p>Thank you for joining us. We look forward to doing this each month. Now, if you would, bow your head in prayer with me.</p>

    <div class="prayer">
        <p>King Jesus, we come humbly before you, seeking your face, your grace, in humble obedience to your law and your word. We come as sinners, saved only by grace, seeking your providence in our lives and our nation.</p>
        <p>Lord God, give us wisdom to see what is right in every day and circumstance, and courage to do what is right in obedience to your will.</p>
        <p>It is in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that we pray. Amen.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">Pastor's Introduction & Message</div>
    
    <div class="speaker">Secretary Hegseth (Introducing Speaker)</div>
    <p>It is a privilege for me to introduce Pastor Brooks Podiger, who is the pastor of my church back in Tennessee where we attended before we came here—Pilgrim Hill Reformed Fellowship. He has long been a mentor of mine, of my wife and I, of our family. He is a Bible-believing, rock-steady minister, Christian man, family man, who—we were in Bible studies together there long before anything like this seemed possible and now here we are. I welcome Brooks Podiger.</p>

    <div class="speaker">Pastor Brooks Podiger</div>
    <p>Thank you, Secretary Hegseth. It has been an honor to stand by your side these past couple years in Christian fellowship, and what an honor to stand at this podium today. Some of our prayer meetings last year in Tennessee were just me and you, 6 a.m., praying for God's blessing on this nation. We do indeed pray to a God who hears.</p>
    <p>To you military service members and civilian staff carrying out this important mission at this building, I bring gratitude from the saints of Pilgrim Hill Reformed, where I have the privilege of serving as pastor.</p>

    <div class="scripture">
        <p>America's first commander in chief, George Washington, said in 1789: <em>"It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and to humbly implore his protection and favor."</em></p>
        <p>So we have come today to heed this wise counsel from Washington.</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you would, join me in earnest prayer.</p>

    <div class="prayer">
        <p>Gracious and Almighty God of heaven,</p>
        <p>We come humbly as befits a king, for as your word says: <em>"Kingship belongs to the Lord and he alone rules over the nations."</em></p>
        <p>We come boldly, in the name of our faithful high priest Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
        <p>We thank you for this great land and nation you have given us.</p>
        <p>We pray for our leaders, especially President Trump. Thank you for using him to bring stability and moral clarity. Please continue to protect him and give him wisdom. Surround him with counselors who fear your name and love your precepts.</p>
        <p>For all warriors under the banner of the DoD, we thank you. We lift up their families—grant them peace and supply all their needs, physical and emotional.</p>
        <p>We pray for the Secretary's Christian prayer service: as your word declares, if your people humble themselves and pray and seek your face, you will hear from heaven and heal their land.</p>
        <p>Let this be a place where Christians come together to do just this. May your power move through the Pentagon, the nation's capital, and this nation.</p>
        <p>Bring repentance, healing, and your gospel to all in need.</p>
        <p>We pray all these things in the name above all names—our Lord Jesus, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p>Amen.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">Congregational Hymn</div>
    
    <div class="speaker">Pastor Podiger</div>
    <p>Let us rise and sing Amazing Grace together.</p>

    <div class="hymn">
        <p><strong>Amazing Grace</strong> <em>(Sung by congregation)</em></p>
        <p>Amazing grace, how sweet the sound,<br>
        That saved a wretch like me.<br>
        I once was lost but now am found,<br>
        Was blind but now I see.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">Sermon: "Be Still and Know That I Am God"</div>
    
    <div class="speaker">Pastor Brooks Podiger</div>
    <p>I want to take a few minutes now to encourage you from the word of God, specifically from a text that you may already know. My text for today is Psalm 46:10, which says: <em>"Be still and know that I am God."</em></p>

    <p>By a show of hands, who has heard that text before? "Be still and know that I am God." Pretty much all of us, and for good reason—it is an immensely comforting verse. But I wonder, do you know its actual context?</p>

    <div class="scripture">
        <p>Psalm 46 is not a psalm about nature walks and sipping lattes, which you might surmise if you just hear "be still and know that I'm God" without any context. No, quite apart from it, Psalm 46 is a psalm written by warriors about being in the midst of war.</p>
        
        <p>Here's the context, beginning in verse 8:</p>
        <p><em>"Come, behold the works of the Lord, how he has brought desolation on the earth. He makes wars to cease to the ends of the earth; he will break the bow and shatter the spear; the Lord burns the chariots with fire. Be still and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth. The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress."</em></p>
    </div>

    <p>The call to "be still and know that I am God" is a call to quiet attentiveness of soul—not sipping a latte, but when the bullets are flying around your head. The call to be still and know that I am God is to remember, when you feel the gravity and the burden that you carry every day, to know there is a God in heaven and you are not him—and what a relief.</p>

    <p>This exhortation is specifically for you in this room, in a way that us civilians don't understand. What about being under the DoD banner makes it especially necessary to be still and know that the Lord is God?</p>

    <div class="section-header">Two Observations and Four Exhortations</div>
    
    <div class="speaker">Pastor Podiger (continued)</div>
    
    <p><strong>Observation #1: The Temptation to Think You're in Complete Control</strong></p>
    <p>Because of the gravity of your job, because of the power of our weapons, because of the weightiness of the responsibility, all the civilian eyes and allies' eyes on you hoping you'll help us—there's a temptation to think that you're actually in control and responsible for final outcomes, especially for those who issue the commands and do the aiming and the shooting.</p>

    <p>Now you do have great responsibility, there is no doubt about that. But you are not ultimately in charge of the world—the Lord is. Our Lord Jesus said in Matthew 10: <em>"Not a sparrow will fall to the ground apart from my heavenly Father."</em> And if our Lord is sovereign even over the sparrow's falling, you can be assured that he is sovereign over everything else that falls in this world, including Tomahawk and Minuteman missiles, including strategy meetings and war room debriefings. Jesus has the final say over all of it.</p>

    <div class="scripture">
        <p>This is why David, the great warrior king of Israel, declared in Psalm 20:7: <em>"Some will trust in chariots, some will trust in horses, but we will trust in the name of the Lord our God."</em></p>
    </div>

    <p>So distinguished personnel, be still and know that he is God—which means, by necessary inference, you are not. And what a relief! You don't have to bear the burden of the world; that's God's responsibility. He's far better at it than you are. Yours is to do your duty diligently, faithfully, excellently, as unto the Lord, and then to trust him with the final outcomes of it all. He's king, and he's really good at his job.</p>

    <p><strong>Observation #2: The Temptation to Think You're All Alone</strong></p>
    <p>It is an honor to be part of the military, but as you know far better than I could ever know, parts of your job can feel very isolating as well: the confidential details that you can't even share with your spouse, the coming deployment that you can't yet tell your kids, the unique mental strain the pressure brings, the PTSD that you suffer in silence with.</p>

    <p>It is an honor to be in your position, but parts of it are isolating as well—it's part of the essential sacrifice. And it's when this very real feeling comes that you need to be still and know that the Lord is God, that his eye is upon you, that he walks in lockstep with you every step that you take.</p>

    <div class="scripture">
        <p>Hear the words again of the great warrior king, King David, when he felt this in Psalm 23: <em>"Even though I walk from time to time through the valley of the shadow of death, I won't fear evil. Why? Because you're with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me."</em></p>
    </div>

    <p>Notice King David actively dwelt on, meditated on, sung about these realities—and that's what I want you to do also. And remember, if you are a Christian, if you have trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ, God is not just God to you anymore. How did our Lord teach us to pray? "Our Father." God has become your Father, who loves you with all the love that he has for his son, who knows you in your fears and your joys and your sins and your temptations and your marital conflict far better than you even understand it, and who has promised to never leave you nor forsake you, to be with you even until the end of the age.</p>

    <p>God is an attentive, merciful, kind, gracious Father who will very soon receive you into his arms on the final day. So be still and know that that God is God when you feel the temptation to believe you're in complete control or when you feel the temptation to believe that you are all alone. You are not. The Lord is with you; he will comfort you.</p>

    <div class="section-header">Four Practical Exhortations</div>
    
    <div class="speaker">Pastor Podiger (Four Ways to "Be Still")</div>
    
    <p><strong>1. Bookend Your Day with Scripture and Prayer</strong></p>
    <p>In scripture you say "I wish I had a word from the Lord." He gave us a really big book—it's called the Bible. So let God speak to you first word of the day, last word in the evening, and then pray—speak back to him. Bookend your day with scripture and prayer.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Have Someone in Your Spiritual Foxhole</strong></p>
    <p>You don't just need someone to have your back when you are on the warfield; you need someone to have your back when you're on the spiritual warfield, which is all the time. And I'm not talking about platitudes—"Hey brother, praying for you, hope things are cool." I'm talking about somebody who's mature and who knows you, who you could actually confess your sin to and it would be a safe place and say "I really need specific help. Me and my wife are really struggling. I lashed out at my kids. I need to repent and I need your help." Have someone in your spiritual foxhole. Seek them out, look them in the eyes, use words and say "Please, I need you to pray for me and with me." God gives grace to the humble.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Prioritize Weekly Worship</strong></p>
    <p>There's nothing more important for the spiritual health of the Christian than the gathering with the saints on the Lord's day. This is where Christ meets most powerfully with his people to strengthen and encourage us in the gospel, to shield us from the flaming arrows of the evil one—which is why Satan doesn't want you to go. But you will go. You will show up, you will prioritize it whenever physically possible, you will bring your children, and you will worship the living God, and you will be still and know that he is God.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Make This Monthly Gathering Immovable</strong></p>
    <p>The fact that this service is happening today is proof that God's blessing is still on our land, despite our best efforts. So show up, sing loud, pray fervently, and all by faith heed the wisdom of the great founder Samuel Adams when he gave this charge: <em>"May every citizen in the army and in the country have a proper sense of the deity upon his mind and an impression of that declaration recorded in the Bible: 'Him that honoreth me I will honor.'"</em></p>

    <div class="prayer">
        <p>Be still and know that I am God. Our Lord and our God, we pray by your Spirit you would impress these things upon us. And now we would pray the way our Lord taught us to pray, saying:</p>
        <p><em>"Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever and ever. Amen."</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">Closing Hymn</div>
    
    <div class="speaker">Pastor Podiger</div>
    <p>For the sake of time, let us stand and read the first and the last verse of "A Mighty Fortress." I've heard the military can sing, so prove me right.</p>

    <div class="hymn">
        <p><strong>A Mighty Fortress Is Our God</strong> <em>(Sung by congregation)</em></p>
        <p>A mighty fortress is our God,<br>
        A bulwark never failing;<br>
        Our helper he amid the flood<br>
        Of mortal ills prevailing.<br>
        For still our ancient foe<br>
        Doth seek to work us woe;<br>
        His craft and power are great,<br>
        And armed with cruel hate,<br>
        On earth is not his equal.</p>
        
        <p><em>[Final verse]</em><br>
        That word above all earthly powers,<br>
        No thanks to them, abideth;<br>
        The Spirit and the gifts are ours<br>
        Through him who with us sideth.<br>
        Let goods and kindred go,<br>
        This mortal life also;<br>
        The body they may kill;<br>
        God's truth abideth still;<br>
        His kingdom is forever!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-header">Benediction</div>
    
    <div class="speaker">Pastor Podiger</div>
    <div class="prayer">
        <p>May the Lord bless you and keep you; may the Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you; may the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace.</p>
        
        <p>And we'll end with the doxology. Where I come from, we raise our hands for the doxology, so you are welcome to:</p>
        
        <p><em>"Praise God from whom all blessings flow;<br>
        Praise him, all creatures here below;<br>
        Praise him above, ye heavenly host;<br>
        Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen."</em></p>
