# Primary Biblical Passages Supporting a Complementarian View

This document outlines key biblical passages that are commonly cited to support a complementarian or hierarchical understanding of gender roles in the church and family. This view holds that men and women have different, complementary roles, with men holding primary leadership authority.

This stands in contrast to the egalitarian position, which is often supported by passages like Galatians 3:28 ("There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus").

## 1. 1 Timothy 2:11-14

> "A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner."

**Neutral Explanation of Interpretation:**
This is one of the most direct and foundational passages for the complementarian view regarding church leadership. The interpretation is based on two main arguments presented in the text:
1.  **The Order of Creation:** The passage points to the Genesis account where Adam was created before Eve. This is interpreted as establishing a principle of male headship and leadership from the beginning.
2.  **The Order of the Fall:** The passage references Eve being deceived, not Adam. This is interpreted to suggest a reason for the prohibition on women holding teaching authority over men in the church, linking it to a perceived vulnerability to deception.

## 2. Ephesians 5:22-33

> "Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything..."

**Neutral Explanation of Interpretation:**
This passage is the primary text for the complementarian view of marriage and family structure. The key elements of the interpretation are:
*   **Headship and Submission:** It establishes a parallel where the husband's role as "head" of the wife is analogous to Christ's role as head of the church. This headship is seen as a position of loving leadership, responsibility, and sacrifice.
*   **Voluntary Submission:** The wife's submission is understood not as a forced obedience but as a voluntary and respectful recognition of the husband's God-given leadership role within the family structure, mirroring the church's submission to Christ.

## 3. 1 Corinthians 14:34-35

> "Women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church."

**Neutral Explanation of Interpretation:**
This passage is interpreted, particularly by more traditional complementarians, as a clear directive limiting the audible participation of women in the public worship service. The command for "silence" is often understood to specifically prohibit women from exercising authoritative teaching or judging prophecies in the gathered church, thereby preserving male leadership in that context.

## 4. 1 Corinthians 11:3-9

> "But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God... A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; neither was man created for woman, but woman for man."

**Neutral Explanation of Interpretation:**
This passage is used to build a theological framework for headship. It is interpreted as outlining a divine order or hierarchy of authority: God -> Christ -> Man -> Woman. By referencing the creation account again (woman being created *from* and *for* man), the passage is seen as grounding gender roles in the very nature of creation, not just in cultural norms. The man's role as the "glory of God" and the woman's as the "glory of man" is interpreted as reflecting these distinct, complementary roles.

## 5. Colossians 3:18 & 1 Peter 3:1

> **Colossians 3:18:** "Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord."

> **1 Peter 3:1:** "Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives..."

**Neutral Explanation of Interpretation:**
These passages are seen as reinforcing the instruction found in Ephesians 5. They are direct, concise commands for wifely submission within the household. Complementarians view them as consistent and clear evidence that this hierarchical structure in the family is a core and repeated tenet of New Testament teaching, prescribed by multiple apostles.
