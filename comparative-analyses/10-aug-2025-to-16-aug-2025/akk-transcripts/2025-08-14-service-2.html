34:01
uh be expectant. Lift your faith. Today is your day to receive powerfully from
34:07
God. God, we thank you for your presence and your power. I thank you, Holy Spirit, for what you're about to do for
34:14
every single person watching. I thank you, Lord, for your power that has no limits and for bringing your anointing
34:22
to this earth, to the body of Christ, so that your people can be free and healed
34:29
and encounter your power, which is your love. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Holy
34:35
Spirit. We invite you to have your way. Amen. Hallelujah. So, I'm going to get
34:40
in the word right now. Um, this message is called How to Let Your
34:48
Good Deeds Shine. It says in Matthew 5:14, "You are the light of the world,
34:55
like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden. No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket. Instead, a lamp
35:02
is placed on a stand where it gives light to everyone in the house. In the
35:08
same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see so that everyone will
35:16
praise your heavenly father. So, you know, first of all, this is where
35:22
the title comes from. Let your good deeds shine out for all to see. And this
35:28
scripture is one of the prophetic scriptures, one of the scriptures that
35:33
God has given us uh as a body of Christ, as those of you who are Planet 5F
35:38
Church, as a prophetic direction. We're always called to shine our lights for
35:44
Jesus. But this year, we are called to shine like never before. This is the
35:49
year of acceptance. This is the the year 2025 is the year of
35:54
the Lord's acceptance. It is a year where God is causing there to be a
36:00
harvest of souls. He is causing people to their eyes to open up where they were
36:06
closed before. He has been planting seeds for a long time and now the harvest is ripe for people to receive
36:13
him and truly receive him. Him in his fullness. Jesus. Jesus in his fullness.
36:19
Jesus not a religious Jesus but not a Jesus void of power but the real Jesus
36:24
who comes in power. who has brought revival, who is moving in great power
36:29
now to set the captives free, who is moving through the five-fold ministry through apostles and prophets, restoring
36:37
what has been lost in the body of Christ, restoring what we see in the book of Acts that has been lost, such as
36:44
his power, such as his way of equipping with the five-fold ministry, such as
36:49
purity, such as order. Hallelujah. So in this
36:55
year of acceptance, it is so important for every believer, every warrior in the
37:01
revival army to shine their light. It is important. It is vital for you to shine
37:07
your light because this is how the harvest comes in is for laborers to go
37:13
out and go out into the world, go out into the dark places and shine their lights. So this is how people are saved.
37:21
This is how people come into the revival is when we will be used as vessels to shine our light. And so I've spoken a
37:29
lot about this this year. Um the conference the the annual conference at 5F Church this spring was called Arise
37:38
and Shine. Um, and that was prophetic that it the that the the whole conference was
37:45
equipping you revival warriors to shine your light to do what God is
37:54
calling you to do this year. Side note, if you weren't at that conference and if
37:59
you didn't see the the videos of the conference, definitely watch it on
38:05
YouTube. It's on my YouTube channel. Um there is uh a a playlist of all of the
38:15
videos. So if you search for ar if you search under my playlists arise and shine or you can even search apostle
38:21
Katherine or Katherine Arise and shine it'll pop up you you can see all the sessions there. So, that's a side note,
38:27
but um today I I'm going to be teaching you how to shine your light, but
38:32
specifically specifically what it means to shine your light. And because I'm going to be
38:38
teaching on an aspect that many people don't understand, this is really what it means to shine your light. This is an aspect of shining your light. And that
38:44
is letting your good deeds shine and what that means. So
38:51
first of all, let me define for you what shining your light means. So
38:58
when you give your life to Jesus, hol the Holy Spirit, God himself, the
39:03
creator of the universe lives inside of you and becomes one with you. If Jesus
39:10
is your Lord and Savior, if you have received Jesus as your Lord and Savior,
39:15
the creator of the universe, the God and only God, only true God literally lives
39:24
inside of you. He's not He He's can be He's everywhere at one time. He's also
39:29
in heaven, but he's not only in heaven. He is living literally inside of you
39:34
right now. Hallelujah. Many times we forget that. But let's just praise God for that and renew our minds with that
39:42
exciting shocking reality. Hallelujah. God is inside of me right now.
39:47
Hallelujah. What is there to fear? Hallelujah. I am closer than I can ever be with God right now because he lives
39:53
inside of me. Hallelujah. Praise God. So, um Jesus is the light. He is the
40:01
light. The light of the world. And in him there is no darkness. And his
40:07
light is so powerful, so strong that it conquers, it overcomes, it obliterates
40:14
all darkness. No darkness can stay in his presence. No darkness can ever
40:21
compete with the light with Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And
40:26
that's Satan. Satan's completely darkness. And so he can never compete. He he he his his power is nothing
40:34
compared to the power of Jesus. The bright and powerful light of Jesus.
40:40
Imagine how bright the sun is. And that's just that. Imagine God actually created the sun. God created the sun. So
40:48
if he's if he created the sun, how much more powerful is he than the sun that he
40:54
created? Wow. Hallelujah. So, okay.
41:00
G Jesus, the light, the light that is more powerful than the sun lives inside
41:07
of you. You have a force. You have a light that
41:13
is more powerful than the sun in you
41:19
right now. Woo! Hallelujah. Powerful. Powerful. But this is true.
41:25
This is really, really, really this is true. This is really true.
41:30
But many people don't realize this because they aren't letting
41:37
that light come out. They are not letting that light shine. That's why for
41:43
some of you that's hard to believe or comprehend.
41:50
But when you will let your light shine, your revelation will increase
41:56
of that light of Jesus that is truly living inside of you because you will
42:02
start to see God do wonders through you. You will start to see miracles happen
42:08
through you. You will start to see change happen, lives changed
42:14
when you let your light shine. So,
42:20
um, letting our light shine is simply reflecting
42:26
the light of Jesus that's already in you. That's letting your light shine. It's like it's letting it come out.
42:35
It's letting it come out. You without Jesus are not the light of the world. You are Jesus calls you the Jesus calls
42:41
you the light of the world only because Jesus is in you. That's what makes you the light of the world because you are
42:48
one with Jesus. So
42:53
even though Jesus lives inside of you, it is 100% up
42:58
to you if you will let Jesus come out and touch others. If you will let you will you will be a vessel of God where
43:06
Jesus the light is flowing out of you. That's 100% a choice. It's a daily choice. You have to make that choice
43:13
every day. So um being the light of the world is is
43:19
not about drawing people to yourself. It is not about looking shiny and amazing.
43:26
It is 100% about letting Jesus out of you, letting Jesus flow out of you. It's
43:32
100% about pointing to Jesus like you're purely a vessel.
43:39
That's what being the light of the world is. Being uh letting your light shine means
43:46
so many different things, but to summarize it, being the light of the world, letting your light shine, letting
43:51
your light shine is pointing people to Jesus, is advancing God's kingdom, is
44:00
attracting people to Jesus,
44:06
is removing darkness. That's the summary. And so that can take
44:11
on many forms. One big way we you can shine your light
44:17
always every day is with the people in your life, family
44:24
members, roommates, friends, strangers you see when you do errands, co-workers.
44:34
Whenever you interact with them, you have the choice to let your light shine, to let Jesus come out of you. Let his
44:40
light come out come out of you and touch them by how you treat people. Showing love to them, showing kindness, smiling
44:49
with from your heart is a big way to shine your light. Speaking kind words, doing kind things
44:57
for others, serving others, putting people first. That's that is how
45:02
you shine your light. um telling people about Jesus, sharing
45:08
your testimony, telling people about revival and doing this in any way
45:13
possible, whether that's through social media, using your social media to share videos, posts about Jesus, about
45:21
revival, live streams, um posting on your own page, just your
45:27
own testimony, and in person telling people about Jesus and revival and your testimony and
45:35
others testimonies and spreading flyers out. There's some
45:40
people putting car magnets I've seen on their car. Hallelujah. Pointing people to Jesus. Need a
45:46
miracle. Pointing people to see where they can find the miracle worker Jesus
45:53
Christ. Hallelujah. So, um, these are big ways that we shine
46:00
our lights is by loving others through our words, through spreading the good
46:06
news, um, being kind to people. And
46:12
I want to now talk about another thing. Now, those are all considered. It says in verse 16, 5:16,
46:20
in the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see. So, all of those that I just mentioned are good
46:27
deeds. Those are good deeds. And when you do those good deeds, you're letting
46:33
those good deeds shine out for all to see. And you're attracting people to
46:39
Jesus. Um, and now, so, so there's another part of
46:45
good deeds that I want to share with you today that maybe you're not, maybe you
46:50
didn't know this is a good deed that you're called to shine in. This is one of the ways you shine your light
46:57
and that is in doing the work of God. In doing the work of God. What whatever
47:03
that is. That can be mundane things. That can be in areas of leadership. that
47:09
can be um what behind the scenes or in
47:15
front of the scenes in the spotlight where people can see preaching, ministering, but also backstage where
47:22
nobody sees nobody but Jesus and maybe a couple other people.
47:28
So, whatever you're doing to serve God, whatever you're doing for the work of
47:33
God, those are considered good deeds.
47:39
that shine out for all to see. So, um,
47:46
being the light of the world, shining your light, this also means behind the scenes doing the work of God. And I
47:54
wanted to to share that with you because I think many people as they've been hearing we must shine our lights. Many
48:02
people may think it means only the first part what I first shared about shining
48:07
your light where it's these face-to-face interactions with people and showing love and kindness to people to their
48:14
face or through messages and and social media and everything. But you also are
48:21
called to shine your light where only Jesus sees it or only a couple people
48:29
see your good deeds. But actually
48:34
many more maybe thousands or millions are seeing your good deeds and are
48:39
seeing the light but they don't know it's you.
48:45
But that doesn't matter because to be to shine our light to be the light of the world is 100% about Jesus's light. It
48:54
has nothing to do with drawing people to us for us to look impressive, for us to
48:59
get recognition, for us to get applause. It's nothing to do with that. So to
49:05
shine your light can be seen or not seen because it's completely about letting
49:12
the light of Jesus be seen. And that can be done behind the scenes. You see,
49:17
anything with the work of God, anything that is done for the work of God, for the advancing of God's kingdom,
49:27
what you are doing is you are reflecting the light of Jesus in you. He's put anointing in you. He's put his spirit in
49:33
you and he's given you gifts and he's given you abilities and he's given you his spirit to do his works. And these
49:41
are so many different things. There's so many aspects to the work of God. There's so many different parts to the work of
49:48
God. So many different areas that are needed for for people to serve in for
49:54
the work of God. If like if I'm just thinking right now about like at 5F
50:00
church, if I'm thinking about all the different aspects that go into the work of God, I'm thinking but there's there's
50:07
um there's people running the screen. There's people running the lyrics for the the worship team. There's the
50:13
worship team themselves leading us in worship. There's um the camera crew.
50:19
There's the people running the live stream. There's the people um
50:25
there's there's people that are moderating on YouTube, on all the different on Instagram, on Tik Tok, on
50:31
Facebook. They're moderating. There's um several people translating different
50:37
languages of the service of the live stream right now. By the way, there's Spanish and Portuguese translation happening right
50:43
now. Go to the link in my bio or at 5Furch.org and find the resources tab, international resources tab if you want
50:49
to hear this in Spanish or Portuguese. Hallelujah. There's um even for the live stream
50:54
today um there's there's those those helping set up the live stream for this here. I'm
51:02
not doing this on my own. Um there are people um there are ushers that are
51:09
helping with offering. There are people um that are helping with security to
51:14
make sure everything's in order and and and good. And there's people uh uh that
51:19
help with the buckets and blankets for deliverance time. And there's there's so
51:26
many different ones. I'm probably forgetting some right now. There's people who are filming during before and
51:31
after. There's people who are filming testimonies before and after service. There are uh people
51:38
there are people that are interacting with people as they come into the church and welcoming them. There are people helping people get books, helping people
51:45
get get um 5F merch, for example. There's people um that are editing all
51:53
the videos. There are people that are helping the social media accounts be run. Um
52:00
there are people that are helping all the like helping with quotes and helping with with captions and just so many
52:07
things. There's so many things that that are going on just for just for just for
52:12
5F church for example. And I think I'm missing some people, but this is just I mean some different areas, but there's
52:17
just so many different so many different aspects of the work of God and so many
52:24
of those things that I just named are behind the scenes things. But for the
52:30
work of God to go forth and for it to go forth with excellence and for it to go forward to God's standard.
52:36
Small group leaders, there's another one. Um leading the small groups. Um,
52:42
but there's so many all these different things are needed for the the the work
52:47
of God to grow, the kingdom of God to advance, for us to not just stay at one
52:53
level where we can't reach the world, but for where we can keep on reaching
52:59
reaching more and more people for the standards to rise, for excellence to increase. For some people, maybe they
53:06
would be held back from receiving if our because our standard was low because the
53:13
excellence was low. Maybe these pe maybe people if our excellence was low, our standard was low, people could look and
53:19
see that we don't really care about um we we don't take we we don't give that
53:26
much care to things. And it can speak things like that. And it can these things matter. It matters that we go at
53:33
God's speed and at his level and with standard. So there's all these different
53:38
moving parts to make sure that the work of God goes forth goes forth daily goes
53:44
forth with standard with God's standard in excellence. Um so
53:53
every single thing I mentioned right there for example people are they're being used these people are being used
54:00
by God. They are let they are letting the light of Jesus come through them. They're using what God has put in their
54:06
hand. Like how Moses God said, "What is in your hand?" When Moses was like
54:12
basically he's he's saying, "How will the people know that you've sent me?" Basically, he's saying, "How can I be
54:17
effective for the kingdom of God? How can I do what you've called me to do? How can I fulfill my purpose on this
54:23
earth? H how can what you're asking me to do, I do?" And
54:29
he says, "What's in your hand?" and it was a staff and then he said, "Throw your staff on the ground." And when he threw it on the ground, uh uh it turned
54:36
into a serpent. And so it was a sign. God was God was doing a sign showing him
54:41
how he was going to do signs and wonders through him as he used what was in his hand. So
54:48
every person is called to the work of God. Every single believer is called to
54:53
the work of God. You are called to be active in the work of God. You were called to you you you you have been
55:00
given a staff in your hand and it looks like different things. It looks like giftings, abilities,
55:06
a mind that can figure out things, that can solve problems, uh creativity,
55:13
uh a voice. You have been given a staff. You've been given things. You've been
55:19
born with things. You've been God created you in your mother's womb with things. Other things will be activated
55:24
once you just try. And when you use what's in your hand,
55:32
the power of God begins to move through you. So when you use your giftings, your abilities, your words, whatever God is
55:40
asking you to use, that staff, you use. And as you use it, the light of the
55:45
world comes through you. The light comes through you. As you do the good deeds,
55:50
the light shines through you. And so, um, this is very important for
55:56
you to know because especially with this word of this this direction this year of shining your light. Um, it's very
56:04
important for you to to know really exactly what that means. And if you are called to a lot of behind the scenes
56:10
work for God, for you to not think you are not shining your light because
56:16
people aren't directly seeing your face as you're doing good deeds, right? So um
56:26
as you you know here this is one example that just happened literally yesterday. um
56:33
someone on our editing team um she edited a video that went out yesterday,
56:41
a recap of it was like a recap showing and showing highlights of what God did
56:48
this Sunday at 5F Church. It was just like a quick I don't know one to two
56:53
minute video or something. But it was so beautiful just just capturing how God
56:59
touched people, delivered people, delivered a young child and hearing their testimonies after some of their
57:05
testimonies. Oh, it was so beautiful. So beautiful. And um I was just telling her like um
57:14
this this video is so beautiful. You did a great job. And um she shared with me
57:20
actually that um someone who was on our camera crew who we had hired. So not
57:28
they're not coming to not originally coming to the church to come to the church to to you know but just coming
57:34
being hired. So one of them um he shar he wrote to her saying um just how
57:44
beautiful or she he didn't know who's who did it. says, "I don't know who did this, but I just wanted to say the way
57:50
this video was edited, it just captured so beautifully, so well. It captured so
57:56
well what what took place on Sunday, like as if you were there." Cuz I was there in person. I saw in person and it
58:04
just really it was like you were there. And um and immediately as I as she shared that
58:11
that he sh that he had shared that with her with them not knowing it was her but
58:17
I I literally could just see in the spiritual realm like how her light was shining and he didn't even know who did
58:24
the video but you know and as I said this was someone that was hired you know not just an attendee of the church but
58:32
um it's like the light the light of Jesus was put on that video through the
58:38
the editing. The Holy Spirit guided her as as she edited the video and it made
58:46
the light of Jesus to be seen by him. Not not just by him but by so many people by thousands have seen this and
58:52
have commented how they were touched by it and everything. And that's just one video. There's so many videos where this
58:57
is taking place. But um in that moment I just saw so clearly how her light was
59:05
shining but people didn't even know who did it but her light was shining. Didn't
59:11
matter that people didn't know who did it because it's all about letting the
59:16
light of Jesus be seen. So when she had put her good deeds and used what's in
59:22
her hand, now the lie of Jesus was being seen more in this world. Hallelujah.
59:30
Hallelujah. So this is so important for you to realize because when you are
59:36
interacting with people face to face and you are um
59:42
when you are talking to them and talking to them with love and maybe sharing your testimony or talking about Jesus, you
59:48
may directly see someone tear up, be touched. Maybe they will share with you
59:54
that you made their day or something like that. And it can be just right in
1:00:01
your face like so joyous, just evidence that your light is shining, right? And
1:00:08
so, but when you're doing things behind the scenes, you you can't see that. You can't
1:00:14
usually see how your light is affecting people, is removing darkness, is
1:00:22
changing the world. You can't you cannot really see that. It must be done in
1:00:27
faith. And so I want to encourage you all that whatever you are doing for God,
1:00:36
whatever you're doing for God, your light is shining powerfully,
1:00:41
whether people recognize it, whether they see it's you or not. And you're literally releasing more of the light
1:00:48
into the world with everything you do for God. With every work of God you do,
1:00:54
anything you do to serve God, literally, it's getting brighter outside in the
1:00:59
spiritual realm. The darkness is being removed more because of what you did in the
1:01:06
spiritual realm. Hallelujah. And you can really see that when you're with people face to face. Like you literally see
1:01:12
them light up and you literally can see, wow, Jesus through me, changed the atmosphere, changed the room. You can
1:01:20
see it got brighter. But you need to also know that whatever you're doing
1:01:25
behind the scenes, it is just as powerful. It is It is just as powerful
1:01:31
as seeing life come to someone's face as God moves through you. Hallelujah.
1:01:38
Praise God.
1:01:46
So I want to let you all be aware also of a scheme of the devil to try to stop you
1:01:52
from shining your light. The devil hates for you to shine your
1:01:58
light more than anything. Of course, because as I just shared, the darkness is being removed more every time you let
1:02:05
your your light shine. every time you let your good deeds shine out for all to
1:02:11
see. So, you need to be aware that the devil hates what you're doing, whether
1:02:17
it's in the spotlight or behind the scenes. He hates what you're doing
1:02:23
because you're destroying his kingdom and he's losing because of you.
1:02:30
So, you really need to be wise and discerning
1:02:36
to be aware that the devil wants to try to stop you from letting your good deeds
1:02:42
shine. Um, this is very important um to know
1:02:50
especially when you're doing like things that maybe aren't so
1:02:57
obvious that you didn't really know until now that wow this was a powerful way God was using me. This is a powerful
1:03:02
way he wants to use me. This is a powerful way I'm shining my light. You got to be aware
1:03:08
when God calls you to do something, he's really called you to do something.
1:03:14
Whether this was spoken through your spiritual leader, God is calling you to do this right now
1:03:21
or asking you to do something or whether the Holy Spirit has spoke to
1:03:27
you in your heart. But you know that must align with God's order
1:03:34
because sometimes the devil masquerad masquerades himself as an angel of light
1:03:39
and speaks something that sounds like God but it contradicts
1:03:45
what your spiritual leader has has spoken. That's how the devil likes to um that's
1:03:53
how the devil attempts to pull people from God's will. So, but whe so so
1:04:00
whether the Holy Spirit has truly spoken to you, but make sure it's really the Holy Spirit that's spoken to you, not the devil masquerade himself as an angel
1:04:05
of light. And how you know that is that the word it should align with the word of God and it should align with um your
1:04:12
spiritual leader. Like it shouldn't contradict what has been spoken through your spiritual leader. Now, this is not
1:04:17
for every leader. This is I'm talking about true anointed leaders that you can trust that God has truly shown you the
1:04:24
fruits and you know it is safe here. you know this is a true vessel of God and you were planted there. That's what I'm
1:04:30
talking about. So um when God has called you to do something,
1:04:36
he has really called you to do that. He has I mean it's very simple. It's very
1:04:42
simple. If he has called you to do something, he has he has indeed called you there.
1:04:50
Do not second guess it. Do not question it. Be aware that the devil will send
1:04:56
thoughts questioning what God has asked you to do. For one, the devil will
1:05:04
send thoughts saying that you're inadequate. You're not good enough. You don't have what it
1:05:10
takes. There's someone more better qualified than you.
1:05:16
Um the it says in 1 Corinthians 1:27, instead God chose things the world
1:05:24
considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise. And he
1:05:29
chose that he and he chose things that are powerless to shame those who are powerful.
1:05:37
God chose the foolish things. So what what that means is that
1:05:44
Moses is a great example. Moses literally had a stutter. He couldn't speak well.
1:05:49
And um God chose him to be a mouthpiece of millions to be a leader. To be a leader,
1:05:56
one of the most important things is that you can communicate well and clearly.
1:06:02
And God chose him. Uh also he murdered someone. Um
1:06:08
and God chose him to be a prophet to be a spiritual leader of millions. What?
1:06:15
That does not make sense in the world. That's foolish. That's the meaning of weak and foolish.
1:06:22
So, um, God redeems. God removes the past, the
1:06:28
sins that you've done in the past, he completely removes them. So, it does not matter your past. He will use you just like he just like he used Paul who used
1:06:35
to be Saul whom murdered not one but many people. um not any not just any people but God's people, Christians,
1:06:43
Christian leaders, um disciples. So um
1:06:52
God calls weak and foolish things. So literally everyone that God calls,
1:06:58
I mean I'm pretty sure most if not everyone is going to feel inadequate.
1:07:06
pretty sure everyone actually is going to have at least the feelings and thoughts that they are inadequate. It
1:07:13
could be that their past is too bad. It could be that they don't have the the resume. They don't have the experience.
1:07:19
They don't have the connections, they don't have the look, they don't have the talk, they don't have the words, they
1:07:25
don't have the gifts, they don't have the voice, etc. Um,
1:07:31
that's who God chooses. If you feel inadequate, you're right where you're supposed to be. You're you are among every true
1:07:39
chosen servant of God. Um he chooses weak and foolish things.
1:07:46
So, uh I'm telling I mean many of you know my story. If you're new here,
1:07:52
welcome. Um, my story real quick is that public speaking was my biggest fear and
1:07:58
weakness. And then leading people was another huge weakness. I never could
1:08:05
picture in a million years I would be a leader of anything. Like I didn't ever step up to lead group projects of even
1:08:12
three people in in college and high school. I just sit back and you know I
1:08:18
was not the leader type or what I saw to be thought to be a leader. And literally
1:08:23
public speaking was my biggest fear and weakness. I could sing, I could act with no problem, no nerves. But speaking off
1:08:28
the cuff, I would even get so nervous talking in front of five friends, talking in in like a Bible study, small
1:08:35
group situation where you all go around and say something, I would like get really nervous. That was me. Um and then
1:08:42
God called me to be an apostle, a minister, uh and also of an apostle to
1:08:48
reach the nations and to lead a lot of people around the world
1:08:55
and to speak as my calling, to teach as my calling. I didn't even um
1:09:03
think I was someone who got revelation from God. I was just amazed at preachers and how they got this revelation and the
1:09:10
fire and all that. So God called me when I wanted to be a singer. And when I
1:09:17
received this calling, it was a prophecy through my spiritual father, prophet Dr. Jord Davyy. Um I was like feeling
1:09:23
exactly like Moses. Moses, the story of Moses came in my mind the moment I heard the prophecy.
1:09:29
And um but that's actually how God spoke to me like remember Moses. You're like
1:09:35
Moses right now. Just trust me and obey and I will take care of the rest. I will give you the ability, the words,
1:09:41
everything. Just obey. Simple. So, um I know all about feelings of in
1:09:48
of inadequacy. The devil would put thoughts in my mind
1:09:55
constantly week after week, year after year for um
1:10:02
for about about four years about four years.
1:10:09
It was every time every single week, every single time I would preach, I would hear thoughts saying, "You're not
1:10:15
good enough." uh the church was actually decreasing at the time. Instead of growing or even
1:10:21
staying the same, we decreased every year for four years before revival broke out. And so then the devil would back up
1:10:30
those thoughts with that, you know, like see people aren't people aren't being blessed. It's cuz you're not good
1:10:35
enough. It's cuz the words you're speaking, they aren't blessing them. They don't want to come back and listen.
1:10:43
See, you're not good enough. you you see other preachers, they're so much better.
1:10:48
They're so much better. Like you are not a preacher. Like the this is the
1:10:54
thoughts I would hear I would have in my mind for four years every um week.
1:11:04
But um I had to humble myself because
1:11:10
God spoke the word. God called me and it was as simple as that. God had called me and when he
1:11:17
called when he had called me to do this, he has called me to do this. There's no second guessing. There's no
1:11:24
there's no second thoughts. It's as simple as that. And this is part of being like a child. It's simply
1:11:32
believing what God has spoken and just staying laser focused. anything else
1:11:38
comes, any thoughts, any feelings, any words from people that contradicts it, it's a lie from the devil to stay
1:11:45
focused and value and cherish, hold firm to what God has spoken. You have to do
1:11:52
this, nothing else. You have to do this. What God has spoken, nothing else. I don't know how I'm going to, you know,
1:12:02
improve. move. I don't know how I'm going to be able to do what God has called me to do and reach so many people
1:12:07
when the church is getting smaller. I don't know how, but I it doesn't matter. I just need to stay focused on doing
1:12:15
what God has called me to do. That is it.
1:12:20
And just being like a child. that simple obedience, that simple trust, and also the humility, like the humility to
1:12:30
value God's word and not think I know better.
1:12:35
That's what got me here today where I've been able
1:12:40
to see such transformation in my life and seeing the promises come to pass.
1:12:47
Um, and and God really humbles you. Like at first
1:12:52
I I I mean the way I preach for example is so different from when I began. It's
1:12:59
so different from the first year in the second year. It's so different. You can go back and watch the videos. I don't think we have actually once posted
1:13:06
really of the I don't think we recorded the the the first year or days, but you
1:13:12
can even see they're on YouTube at Five Church YouTube. You can see a difference. Um,
1:13:18
so but that's how God humbles us. So you got to be ready to know that the moment
1:13:24
you start obeying God, you're not going to immediately feel
1:13:30
adequate. In fact, the devil will probably immediately,
1:13:37
you know, he's immediately try to bombard you with thoughts of inadequacy because he's terrified that you've begun
1:13:44
to do what God has asked you to do. You are now sh letting your good deeds shine for everyone to see. And the devil is
1:13:52
terrified and he's already begun to lose so much now more because of you shining
1:13:59
you doing what God has called you to do. So um you you really have to grow
1:14:06
spiritually to know this simple truth that God calls the weak and foolish
1:14:11
things. So that means when he calls you to do something, he's many times he's
1:14:17
going to call you to do something that you don't feel you you have a strength in. Sometimes you do have a strength in one thing, but there's another thing he calls you to that you don't have a
1:14:22
strength you don't really feel like you have a strength in. Yep. That's your weak and foolish area he's
1:14:30
wanting to use because that's what he does. That's what he does to keep people
1:14:35
humble and to let people see his glory that it can only be God.
1:14:41
Um so be ready. Be ready for those thoughts of inadequacy. It's the devil
1:14:48
lying. And you know what? You are going to be a lot better than you are now. But it doesn't mean that you're bad now. It
1:14:55
doesn't mean that you're not good enough now. It doesn't mean that God can't still use you right now.
1:15:01
So, just tell the devil to shut up. Just
1:15:08
grow up spiritually. Renew your mind that the all these thoughts of inadequacy are lies. Sure, you're going
1:15:15
to get a lot better, but you're good enough now. If God has asked you to do something now for his kingdom, to do
1:15:22
good deeds for his kingdom, then you're good enough. God is moving through you. He's given
1:15:28
you the ability, but you have to throw your staff down. And that's where he gives you the ability. That's where he
1:15:34
gives you the supernatural ability. Um,
1:15:42
and I also want to, you know, I want to stress about I I shared I just shared like
1:15:49
a big part of this is being humble. If God asks you to do something, do it.
1:15:57
Whether it's Holy Spirit just spoke this to you or whether it's God spoke through your leader,
1:16:03
do it. God spoke it. That's it. to question, to listen to the voices,
1:16:15
second guess. That is being prideful.
1:16:21
And you got to understand that um worldly logic the devil will use like
1:16:29
worldly logic like well I don't have the capacity to
1:16:34
take on this work of God. I don't think I'll be able to really give it my all so
1:16:42
with all that I have going on right now. So I can't do this. But we're supposed to seek first the kingdom of God and his
1:16:49
righteousness. We're supposed to seek first the kingdom of God. So, you really
1:16:54
need to make sure your priorities are in order because if God has asked you to do something, that's it. That's final. If
1:17:00
he's asked you to do something and it means that there's no time for that thing, that means you need to get rid of something else in your life. That means
1:17:06
you need to strategize and look around in your life and see where you can cut
1:17:11
out five minutes here, five minutes here, five minutes here to take to to create one hour per week of whatever God
1:17:19
is asking you to do for him. For example, this is about humility.
1:17:34
Okay. So I'm teaching you right now about letting your good deeds shine. So
1:17:40
one of the schemes I'm teaching you right now the schemes of the devil to try to stop you from letting your good
1:17:45
deeds shine. So one of them is bringing you thoughts of inadequacy.
1:17:51
Um oh and also the devil be aware of of thoughts that the devil will bring you
1:17:57
thoughts saying that someone else could do this, someone else could do a better job. There's a lot of people there's a
1:18:02
lot of believers. There's a lot of people who could serve in this area that could someone else. It's fine. It's fine
1:18:08
if I don't do this because someone else could do it. That's a lie of the devil to try to get you to stop letting your
1:18:16
good deeds shine. Be aware. If God has asked you to do it, it's done. No second
1:18:23
guessing, no questioning. He's calling you to do it for a purpose. This is part of fulfilling your purpose.
1:18:29
This is part of your breakthrough. This is part of transformation. And this is part of seeing desires of your heart be
1:18:35
fulfilled because you delight in the Lord and then God gives you desires of your heart.
1:18:42
As we serve God, reward comes. As we serve God, we are transformed. As
1:18:48
we serve God, more anointing comes upon us. As we serve God, God can entrust us with more anointing. This Elisha
1:18:56
received double portion anointing. The mantle from Elijah
1:19:01
because he served and served and served and served and served and served Elijah.
1:19:07
It's one of the big ways to receive impartation. And you need anointing to
1:19:12
fulfill your calling on this earth. So the second scheme of the devil to try
1:19:19
to keep you from letting your good deeds shine before people
1:19:25
is
1:19:30
if you fall the devil will temp may try to tempt you
1:19:37
and say you should not get up again. The devil will try to tempt you and say,
1:19:44
"You're not worthy of serving here because you fell, because you made a
1:19:50
mistake." Or the devil may show you other people
1:19:57
and compare you to other people and say like, you know, this person, they didn't
1:20:02
make a mistake. They didn't make a mistake. So they should
1:20:08
do the work of God, this work of God instead. And you you let them do it.
1:20:15
It says in um Proverbs 24:16, "For a righteous man may fall seven times and
1:20:22
rise again." A righteous man or woman
1:20:29
may fall seven times and rise again. So this means that the righteous mean
1:20:38
righteous means you're living righteously. It means that you truly have a heart after God's and you are
1:20:44
living surrender to God and you're walking in obedience to him. But
1:20:51
we are not guaranteed to never make mistakes.
1:20:57
The more you grow, the more you mature, the less mistakes you'll make because you become more like Christ.
1:21:03
But when you first give your life to Jesus, you're living righteously, but you're a baby still.
1:21:09
If you if it's only been one year that you've been surrendered to God or two years, you're still a baby. Have grace
1:21:16
for yourself. Have grace for yourself because the
1:21:22
transformation into Christ, it that that spiritual maturity is what leads to not
1:21:28
making mistakes or not making as many mistakes. So, it's inevitable. It's inevitable
1:21:33
that babies when they first start to walk, they fall down. That's inevitable.
1:21:39
As a parent, you don't say, "I can't believe they fell down. I'm
1:21:45
disappointed in them. And I've been working with them so much, holding on to their hands, working on their balance,
1:21:52
but they still fell down. That's so silly." Well, that's how silly it is for
1:21:57
you in the spiritual realm, you as a spiritual baby. And yes, you've given
1:22:02
your life to Jesus completely a year ago or two years ago. You're still a baby.
1:22:08
You're still growing or a toddler at least. So have grace for yourself. Um
1:22:14
you and you need to understand that those who are surrendered to God especially like especially in this
1:22:20
revival in this anointing where they have really accepted Jesus in his fullness and so therefore can be used
1:22:27
the most powerfully by God because God can entrust them with anointing and and
1:22:33
people are and they are pointing people to the full truth of who Jesus is.
1:22:39
The devil is the most terrified of those people. He's the most terrified. He is
1:22:44
so terrified of you. Even if you're a baby Christian, he is the most terrified of people who will accept Jesus in his
1:22:52
fullness, which is right now not the majority of Christians.
1:22:58
Jesus in his fullness who comes in power who who who casts demons out of people.
1:23:04
Jesus in his fullness who moves like we see he him move through vessels like we see him move through weak and foolish
1:23:10
things in the book of acts moving through apostles and prophets you go to most church most churches today and you
1:23:16
don't see the anointing deliverance apostles
1:23:22
prophets embraced and the new wine in general
1:23:27
embraced and being demonstrated. So that means that those people are not
1:23:34
accepting Jesus in his fullness. Now maybe it's just that they haven't heard yet. So it doesn't mean that they're all
1:23:42
a bunch of Pharisees. I don't mean it like that. But I just mean that they're not a threat to the devil. If you will
1:23:48
accept Jesus in his fullness like this, you are the biggest threat to the devil on this earth. You are you as a baby
1:23:55
Christian who accepts Jesus in his fullness is more more of a threat to the devil than a minister who leads a
1:24:03
congregation of thousands but doesn't embrace God's power and just speaks nice
1:24:09
sermons. You are way more of a threat to the devil because you can actually lead
1:24:15
people to be set free. you can actually do serious damage to the kingdom rather
1:24:22
than speaking the word but letting demons stay and letting the devil's kingdom still go on.
1:24:30
So you got to be aware of this. You got to be aware that
1:24:35
the devil will test will come and tempt you. The devil the devil attacks
1:24:44
sends the biggest attacks what he's the most afraid of. So you so so so if you've fallen
1:24:54
I it really could have been because a big attack was sent your way. A big
1:24:59
scheme of the devil was sent your way.
1:25:05
But the important thing is that you have repented. You know, you you didn't stay there.
1:25:13
You turned to Jesus. And when you did, he removed your sins completely. He removed your mistake completely. And
1:25:20
he's not punishing you. He's not saying you need to sit on the bench for a long time now.
1:25:27
I'm really disappointed in you and you're not worthy of this calling now. you need to work your way to
1:25:34
maybe be used again by God. That's the devil lying. If you are hearing that,
1:25:40
that's the devil lying.
1:25:47
Many are called, few are chosen. And there's some people who were chosen,
1:25:54
but they fall. And God is asking you to get up again, even if you fall seven
1:25:59
times. What if Peter didn't get back up after he denied Jesus three times? What if he
1:26:06
didn't get back up? Peter was the rock the church was built upon. Peter was the one that delivered the gospel message
1:26:12
for the first time where thousands came to Jesus. It was Peter whom people were coming under his shadow and being healed
1:26:19
and delivered. Every single one who came under his shadow, God put such powerful anointing in him. We don't see anything
1:26:25
as powerful besides Paul, this mighty anointing he was walking in. What if Peter listened to the lies of the devil?
1:26:33
And what if Peter said, you know, Jesus is calling me to be the rock, to be the
1:26:38
leader of all disciples, but now I've messed up the worst of all the disciples besides Judas. And so
1:26:47
I'm not worthy of this. I mean, all the disciples are they're amazing. They're great. Like, what makes me better? And
1:26:54
now I'm definitely not better than all of them. I mean, like more qualified to be a leader because none of them, okay,
1:27:01
they were scared and hid, but they didn't straight up deny Jesus three times after Jesus had called them to be
1:27:09
the rock. Think about the thoughts the devil would have been sending Peter. What if he listened to them and said,
1:27:14
"Peter," or said to Jesus, "Okay, Jesus, I will follow you still, but you got to anoint someone else to be the rock, the
1:27:22
leader. cuz I'm not worthy. I don't deserve this.
1:27:29
He would have missed out on his calling. And
1:27:35
where would we be today?
1:27:42
God put something special in Peter. And when he fell down, it didn't negate what
1:27:47
Jesus had put, what God had put in Peter that was needed for the kingdom.
1:27:54
He put something special in Peter that he didn't put in others. And so, he needed to use Peter. That was
1:28:02
God's plan.
1:28:08
So, stop listening to the devil. If you have fallen and you look at other
1:28:13
people, you look at other believers, you look at other sisters and brothers in Christ and they look perfect, but yet
1:28:20
you made a mistake and you don't see the mistakes they've made. They made mistakes. You don't just don't know about them.
1:28:26
Or maybe the devil, it was a devil coming and testing you and they it was a different time of their testing. The
1:28:32
point is don't compare yourself. Don't ever let shame and condemnation
1:28:40
win in your mind. Shame and condemnation is from the devil always. Full stop. Period.
1:28:48
So the Proverbs 24:16, for a righteous man or woman may fall seven times and
1:28:53
rise again. You must rise again. God is calling you to rise again. So this means keep
1:29:01
letting your good deeds shine for all to see.
1:29:07
Be aware of this scheme of the devil saying you messed up. You disqualified yourself. Sit down on the bench. Stop
1:29:12
letting your good deeds shine. Others can do it instead. Nope. That's the devil lying. Don't listen to him ever
1:29:19
again. God has wiped away your mistakes, wiped away your sins. They are gone.
1:29:27
They are gone. Stop living in the past. Stop living in the past. Stop listening to the devil's lies and see your value
1:29:34
and importance in the kingdom of God. God's counting on you.
1:29:41
We all have something so special and unique for the kingdom for the kingdom
1:29:47
of God that the world needs. It's like the rainbow. The rainbow has so many different colors of light. You have a
1:29:55
specific color of light the world needs. If you're supposed to shine blue, don't
1:30:01
call on red to shine blue for you. They got to shine red. And they don't know how to shine blue. That's your call
1:30:07
calling. Those are your good deeds that will lead more people to Jesus. Less people will
1:30:14
be led led to Jesus if you sit down and don't let your light shine.
1:30:21
See how important this is to simply do what God has called uniquely you to do.
1:30:29
Your part, your assignment, your way of shining your light, of letting your good deeds shine for all to see.
1:30:37
Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you,
1:30:42
Jesus. I'm going to pray for you all right now. And I know that God has just
1:30:48
done something so powerful in the spiritual realm. I see it. I see already a heaviness has lifted off of many
1:30:54
people. I see just tears being released and God is moving through these tears. I see some
1:31:01
of many of you crying right now. I see this is deliverance taking place. It's
1:31:06
the lies of the devil that you kept is coming out right now. It's coming out of
1:31:12
you and this heaviness is is is lifting off as as as God frees you right now.
1:31:19
Hallelujah. I want to uh before I speak and pray over you all, I want to um I want to
1:31:28
encourage you all to renounce what God is leading you to renounce.
1:31:33
There's some of you have been convicted by the word. God spoke to you and your eyes were opened up and now you know you
1:31:40
were believing the devil's lies. You were listening to de the devil's lies in certain areas. And so it's important you
1:31:47
renounce that right now. You renounce certain thoughts, certain um feelings.
1:31:54
Uh you renounce those and any way you have spoken things um in a giving up way
1:32:04
uh you have spoken things were saying like I'm not going to do this anymore. I'm
1:32:10
not going to if something God has asked you to do, just renounce those right now.
1:32:21
And for all of you watching that need deliverance or healing, I encourage you to renounce whatever it whatever it is
1:32:27
that you need deliverance of whatever whatever bondage you have. I
1:32:33
need to um verify something on TikTok right now.
1:32:50
Okay. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
1:32:55
I detach you all now from all these things you have renounced in Jesus'
1:33:00
name. and I break every every demonic covenant you've made
1:33:08
saying that you won't do something that God has asked you to do. I cancel that now. And I declare now that every spirit
1:33:18
of heaviness that has come from the devil's lies and
1:33:23
and and thoughts and demonic emotions, it must go now in Jesus name.
1:33:30
I declare now that every spirit of condemnation, spirit of guilt, it must
1:33:36
go now in Jesus' name. I declare every spirit of rejection, it must go now in
1:33:42
Jesus' name. I see God freeing people right now of words spoken by leaders. Um
1:33:50
like I see leaders in your past that you looked up to in some way.
1:33:57
Um, it's like their words they it like
1:34:02
pushed you down. It like it reinforced the lies of the devil
1:34:07
speaking that you weren't good enough to do something um or that you should sit down and you
1:34:14
weren't needed and it became like this stronghold in your mind. I declare right now for this
1:34:21
stronghold to break off you now. And I declare every every spirit holding you
1:34:28
back from doing what God has called you to do. Spirit of stagnancy, it must go now. All
1:34:35
every spirit that came from these words of people speaking against you and against what
1:34:41
God has called you to do in Jesus' name. And I see some of you being delivered
1:34:46
right now. Some of you have creative ideas that God has given you. Um, some you were doing things for God, but you
1:34:52
stopped doing them because some people told you you were wasting time. Um, that
1:34:58
you weren't really talented at this, so you're wasting your time. Uh, or what you're doing didn't matter or was stupid
1:35:04
or something. I declare all of those lies to come out of you now in Jesus'
1:35:11
name. And I see God freeing people right now of something on your mind that's been
1:35:18
holding you back from being creative and also having problem solving skills and also just being quick and able to do
1:35:26
tasks. Just doing just whatever God is calling you to do. I anything that's blocking
1:35:32
you in your mind, I declare it must go now in Jesus' name. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
1:35:39
Hallelujah. And I declare right now that whatever mistake that you have made
1:35:46
that's been that brought this heaviness that brought this um this darkness in
1:35:52
your life where you just felt guilt. You felt so bad for making the mistake for
1:35:58
disobeying God for knowing knowing better but doing something anyways. There's some of you
1:36:05
that's you felt so bad. You see, it's important to feel bad to have true repentance, but it's very important to
1:36:14
not feel bad for too long. Like you you should feel sorry for making a
1:36:21
mistake, but immediately come to Jesus and say you're
1:36:26
sorry. And don't wallow in feeling bad, feeling sorry. Genuinely feel sorry from
1:36:33
your heart. genuinely be sorry before God,
1:36:39
but do not stay there. Do not stay there. I mean, do not stay in feeling
1:36:45
bad. Turn to Jesus. Receive his grace. Receive his love and know that he is immediately washed away your mistake,
1:36:52
your sin. You do not need to take a long time. Just come into Jesus's arms and
1:37:00
receive his grace immediately. receive his grace immediately because there's work to be done in the kingdom and he to
1:37:07
shine your light you need to be attractive to the world and you need to believe in yourself believe in God in
1:37:13
you have the god you need to have godly confidence you can't go around feeling like I'm not worthy of this you can't
1:37:20
you can't do anything for the kingdom of god that way so this is so important you
1:37:26
you receive God's grace and love and see the importance of being spiritually
1:37:31
mature more of acting spiritually mature.
1:37:38
There's a scripture I read um
1:37:48
do I have it
1:37:53
handy? Um,
1:38:01
there's a scripture I read recently on a Sunday where it literally says, "Be
1:38:06
act spiritually mature." Oh, here it is. Yes. Thank you, Lord. I found it in my
1:38:12
notes. This is from two Sundays ago. 1 Corinthians 16:14.
1:38:17
Act like mature. This is the Amplified version. Act like mature men and women
1:38:24
and be courageous. Be strong. Act like mature men and women. So to be mature,
1:38:31
that's it's a choice. You have to act. You have to take action. So it is very
1:38:36
important you take action to receive God's grace. Receive God's love. Renew
1:38:42
your mind that God's forgotten your past. Renew your mind that God is counting on you. He needs to use you as
1:38:49
a vessel. So be confident that in God's grace that is
1:38:55
washed over you and that it's gone and that God is helping you now stay on track and be in his will. Amen. So I I
1:39:03
release this anointing upon you that you would have strength to act mature, that
1:39:10
you would have wisdom to act mature, that your mind would be sharp, you wouldn't forget, that you would remember
1:39:16
to renew your mind to act mature, to stay in the truth, in God's truth, to
1:39:23
stay in the truth of how God sees you. May you be strengthened in this area in
1:39:31
Jesus name. And I want to declare right now for every demonic spirit of addiction, it
1:39:38
must go. I declare every spirit of depression, every spirit of suicide, every spirit of death and darkness, it
1:39:43
must go. I declare every spirit of anxiety must go. I declare every spirit of lack, every spirit of stagnancy,
1:39:50
baroness must go. Every spirit that has come through trauma, through abuse, through hurtful words of people, it must
1:39:57
go in Jesus' name. through every spirit that has come through the trauma of
1:40:04
hatred towards you, jealous actions towards you, it must go in Jesus' name.
1:40:12
And I speak now that all sicknesses and diseases must go in Jesus' name. I
1:40:18
declare I see someone being healed of endometriosis right now. Be healed right now in Jesus' name. I see someone being
1:40:24
healed of kidney stones. Be healed right now in Jesus' name. I see someone on

1:40:46

1:40:52
I speak this to leave. Be healed in Jesus' name. I see someone having this
1:40:57
like weird ring on their skin, a ring. Be healed in Jesus' name. Thank you,
1:41:03

1:41:29
declare Lyme disease to go in Jesus' name. Thank you, Jesus. There's somebody lymph nodes and issue there be healed in
1:41:36
Jesus' name. Thank you, Lord. I declare now that every demonic spirit attached
1:41:42
to what you renounced must leave now in Jesus' name. Thank you, Jesus. And I
1:41:49
release now the fire of the Holy Spirit. Lift your hands if you don't have them lifted already. Receive the fire of the
1:41:55
Holy Spirit. Receive the baptism of fire now. And receive more boldness. Receive
1:42:01
more joy and zeal, passion for Jesus, for his people, for revival for the
1:42:09
kingdom work to serve God. Let this fire increase in you in Jesus' name. May this
1:42:17
anointing come upon you now. And may this an increase of anointing move
1:42:23
through you upon the good deeds you do so that your good deeds will shine
1:42:28
brighter and more people will be led will be attracted will see your good
1:42:35
deeds will see Jesus. The light that you are presenting that you are showing to
1:42:42
the world. I release peace. I release joy. be filled with God's joy, his love
1:42:48
abundantly now in Jesus name. And whatever miracle you needed today,
1:42:54
I speak this anointing to come upon you and for these miracles to take place now
1:43:00
in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:43:07
Praise God. Thank you, Jesus, for all the miracles you've done today. Thank you, God. Thank you, God. Thank you Lord
1:43:15
for touching your people, for your word. Thank you, Holy Spirit, for every
1:43:20
miracle you have done across the world, for so many who are watching right now
1:43:25
and watching the replay. Thank you, Jesus. We give you all the glory, God. Hallelujah. Praise God. Thank you,
1:43:33
Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. I want to invite all of you right now to thank
1:43:39
Jesus right now by sewing into God's kingdom. This is one of the ways you let your good deeds shine because your your
1:43:46
good deeds for the kingdom of God is anything that's contributing to God's work. Anything that's making the kingdom
1:43:51
of God to advance and your seeds is part
1:43:56
of the staff that's in your hand is part of what God has put in your hand that he is calling you to use. When you throw
1:44:03
down your seeds, God moves upon them supernaturally. And he opens up doors
1:44:09
physically and spiritually for his kingdom for more people to receive the gospel and to receive his anointing and
1:44:15
be healed and delivered. And as you sew, you reap. It's such a blessing to sew
1:44:21
into God's kingdom because not just do you get to be a part of other people being saved, healed, delivered, touched
1:44:28
by Jesus and God's kingdom advancing, but also there's reward for you. God
1:44:34
literally pours out blessings physically and spiritually upon your life when you
1:44:40
sew into God's kingdom. I am a living testimony of this. I have swed
1:44:46
generously. I have swed beyond what I would ever imagine God would ask me to
1:44:52
sew for for many years now for for several years now ever since God
1:44:58
called me. And I'm in awe to see the faithfulness of God with how I with how
1:45:04
he has poured out blessings. There's a scripture that says bring the tithe into the storehouse and see that I won't pour
1:45:09
out so many blessings that you don't have room for it all. And I can say that I have seen abundant life. I am seeing
1:45:16
abundant life in every single area of my life, spiritually to physical
1:45:22
like never before after I was obedient to so generously.
1:45:27
And I am truly in awe of the abundant life that I see in my life now, which I
1:45:33
know is is a reaping it. It what you sow you will reap. So, I want to encourage
1:45:40
you to to sew generously so you can reap generously so God can bless you for his
1:45:48
glory, for your light to shine more, and most importantly, for his kingdom to
1:45:55
advance. Speaking of that, we have two events that God has called us to plan at
1:46:00
5F Church. Revival is now events. One in Paris and one in New Zealand. But these
1:46:06
events to do these events, you know, in um Sweden, I was just in Stockholm, Sweden, and the venue was almost
1:46:12
completely full. There was about 1500 people that came and the venue cost was
1:46:20
uh around $100,000 when you add in all the different components
1:46:26
um to the event. That was the about the total for the event. But the venue takes
1:46:31
up like I don't know 80 90% or majority of the cost is the venue and all that
1:46:38
goes into it. All the different things, the lighting, the audio, the cameras, the live stream, um all the different
1:46:44
things. But um yeah, it costs a lot, you know, because there is a great hunger.
1:46:51
We have to have a big space. Um so the same for London there was 25 20 2500
1:46:58
people that came and I forget the exact cost but it was similar to the cost of the Stockholm event and so we need to
1:47:05
have big venues also for Paris and New Zealand as we're expecting such hunger there. I've never ministered in any of
1:47:11
those countries before and um so therefore we have to raise funds before
1:47:16
we can officially officially plan it officially secure the venue and everything. So I want to

1:53:38
small groups around the world. We have about 40 small groups um, around the US
1:53:44
and around the world. And I am so in awe of how God is moving through these small groups. So many miracles are taking
1:53:49
place and people are growing spiritually and growing on fire for God and finding
1:53:56
community, finding fellow revival warriors in their city, state,
1:54:01
and nation. And it's so special. And I'm seeing firsthand like I was just I got
1:54:07

1:54:13
got to meet with the Norway small group. those who traveled, not all of them, those who traveled and those who
1:54:19
traveled from the Sweden small group and the Finland small group. And it was so
1:54:25
exciting. I mean, it was just so exciting to see them face to face in person and just see what God is doing.
1:54:33
See how the revival fire is increasing in those nations through these groups.
1:54:38
It is so powerful. I'm so excited what God is doing. I'm so excited what God is
1:54:44
doing through these small groups. By the way, on my stories on Instagram, I put um you'll see testimonies from the small
1:54:52
groups. So, I encourage you to watch my stories if you're not to see those testimonies. It's just so amazing to see
1:54:58
how God's power is moving all over the world, the miracles that are happening
1:55:04
all over the world in our 5F family around the world. Um if you want to be a

1:56:25
5Furch. We have members of 5Furch from
1:56:31
163 nations. Oh, wow. Jesus, I'm so in awe. Um, this
1:56:38
past this past week, someone joined us. Someone became a member of 5F Church
1:56:44
from Iran and the week before someone became a member from Pakistan. I'm so in
1:56:49
awe of what God is doing, of
1:56:54
this year of acceptance, just how his revival is spreading. It can't be
1:57:01
contained. Hallelujah. So people watch online um on Sunday services. Many
1:57:07
people get up for the live at all times of the night and morning to be with us live. Other people watch the replays if
1:57:14
their schedule won't allow for them to always get up in the middle of the night for example. But um yeah, people are
1:57:20
because to be planted to be planted at one church that's a spiritual principle that's very important for every single
1:57:26
believer. Uh and um if you want to learn more about that um I have messages about
1:57:33
being planted um on my YouTube under actually there's a YouTube playlist called revival army training playlist.
1:57:40
This this is a very crucial playlist for all of you who are new here. It's a
1:57:47
found has foundational teachings. Teachings that are so important that you
1:57:53
might not have heard of before because it's new wine, new wine revelation that
1:57:58
has been missing so much in the body of Christ. There's been so much religion, so much old wine and not a lot of new
1:58:05
wine. And God is restoring this new wine now. Not just the new wine of the anointing and power, but the new wine
1:58:11
revelation of the kingdom of God in God's ways. So, Revival Army Training
1:58:17
playlist. This is on my YouTube. Watch it. Go through it. There's a lot of videos, but watch at least ju just go
1:58:25
through it. Maybe one a week or something. Make sure you catch up on those videos so you're caught up. Um,
1:58:32
yeah. So, uh, you're going to find teachings about being planted there as well. I mean, what being planted means.
1:58:40
Um, so yeah, being planted is a spiritual principle. So you can be planted uh even if you are not even if
1:58:48
the church is not physically in your city, you can be planted. It's important to be planted where God's power is
1:58:55
moving. It is important to be planted at a church that God is calling you to where you will be equipped, where there
1:59:01
will be the power of God that brings forth anointed teachings to truly feed
1:59:06
you and equip you and anointing that will come upon your life to protect you in the spiritual realm so that you would
1:59:13
have a covering and that the anointing would be able to flow upon you whenever
1:59:18
you need it. Whenever you need healing or freedom, the anointing is being released like being under the shadow of
1:59:23
Apostle Peter. So what's important is that you are planted at the right church
1:59:29
at the church where God's power is. A church really called by God. A church that will really equip you. A church
1:59:35
that has the anointing to help you, protect you, heal, deliver, and that God is specifically calling you to be
1:59:41
planted at. Um, and what's so great is that we have these small groups now. So, um you're able to find community and
1:59:50
gather together virtually and physically um with people in your nation or state
1:59:56
or near you near you. And we are going to have more. They're growing. We have more coming. Hallelujah. We will have
2:00:03
many, many, many, many, many more small groups in God's timing. Praise God. All over the world. Thank you, Jesus. Um so,

2:04:12
especially just everyone watching who is new here, listen up. Uh there's many impersonators of me, scammers who use my
2:04:21
picture and my name and create social media accounts, fake accounts that are not my me. They pretend to be me to get
2:04:29
money to take to try to steal money from people to try to get people to to
2:04:34
give to the church or give to an orphanage, but it's scammers. Okay? So,
2:04:39
I will never be DMing you. I will not be in your DMs. Uh, I will not do that.
2:04:46
This is what the scammers do. They DM people and they pretend to be me and
2:04:51
they ask for ask you to give to an orphanage for example or they say they have a prophetic message for you and you
2:04:56
need to give a seed. That is not me. I do not DM people. Um, and also another
2:05:05
scheme of them is they write they reply to your comments on my posts saying like I want to talk to you more. Message me
2:05:13
here. That is not me and I do not have a Gmail, WhatsApp or a Telegram and I
2:05:20
never do video calls. Um, the only way to contact my ministry
2:05:27
is at info@5church.org. That's our email. Info@5church.org.
2:05:32
That's the only way to contact or on 5church.org website. There's a contact form and
2:05:39
apostle.com. Apostle.com. That's my website. there's a contact form. Those are the only three
2:05:46
ways of contacting my ministry. Um,
2:05:51
and same for booking. All booking goes through info@5church.org
2:05:57
email or the contact forms. There's no other way booking is being done. I do not text people about bookings or asking
2:06:03
to minister somewhere or anything. I do not do that. I've never done that. Um, and also I do not have any Facebook
2:06:11
prayer request groups. No Facebook prayer request groups or any
2:06:17
kind of Facebook groups. And the biggest easiest way to know, listen up. This is the easiest way to know. It's my
2:06:24
original accounts. I have more than 200,000
2:06:30
followers or subscribers on every single social media platform except for X. So
2:06:35
that's YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok. All have more than 200,000. Most have more than 300,000.
2:06:42
So that's the easiest way to know that it's me. X, my name is Katherine Crick.
2:06:48
My username, Katherine Crick. Um, on Facebook, I have a Facebook page, no
2:06:55
groups, a page, which has um 300,000 something follow. Wait, how
2:07:02
many? Several hundred thousand followers. I'm forgetting now. several hundred thousand followers and then I have a Facebook profile that I made
2:07:09
public and that has a blue check mark that has 33 or something thousand followers but it has a blue check mark.
2:07:16
Okay, that's the only difference. So that's how you can easily know it is me. So please let your family and friends
2:07:21
know when you tell them about my ministry about the scammers so that they don't get scammed. Hallelujah. Praise
2:07:28
God. Oh, one last thing. One last thing. Um, if you would like to have a revival
2:07:34
event or you would like to see uh the ministry that takes place like at 5 Church or Revival Now events or the
2:07:41
conferences, if you'd like to see this ministry go forth uh at an event in your
2:07:46
city or nation and you would like to sponsor it, you can email us at info@5fchurch.org.
2:07:55
Praise God. Amen. All right. Well, this has been such a powerful time in God's
2:08:02
presence. Thank you, Jesus, for all you have done. Thank God for all the miracles he has just done. Hallelujah.
2:08:09
Hey, and I just want to say, I usually share this right after the prayer, but I just want to say right now,
2:08:15
it is so important you value what God has released and the word that has gone forth and the anointing that has been
2:08:20
released. Because I'm telling you, I've seen so many testimonies of people receiving miracles, but they didn't
2:08:27
through the screen, but they didn't feel anything in the moment, but then like the next day or several days later or
2:08:33
sometimes longer than that, the miracle manifested,
2:08:38
but they didn't feel anything when the actual miracle took place through the screen. So, I'm telling you, countless
2:08:45
testimonies I've heard of this. So, it's so important you don't throw out what God has released. You don't disvalue it.
2:08:53
It's you you you receive miracles by faith. So, it's so important that you by
2:08:58
faith. It's a it's a choice. I believe I'm choosing to believe that this anointing is real, that the word that
2:09:04
has gone forth will not return void. So, I choose to believe that I have been healed. I have been delivered today.
2:09:09
Receiving miracles is is a lot about principles. The principle of the anointing, the principle of of of of of
2:09:15
a vessel of God walking in the anointing properly using their authority, principle of surrender your you have to
2:09:21
surrender yourself. You have to close the doors to the enemy. You have to position yourself where the anointing is. These are all principles. Something
2:09:26
like like principles laws, not just like lofty. It's not like lofty how to
2:09:31
receive miracles like mysterious. It there's principles get in line with God's ways and you the
2:09:38
miracles happen. Um and then another principle is faith. Faith faith by
2:09:44
choice, not faith with not not about what you feel. So one of the big principles of receiving miracles is
2:09:50
choosing to believe. Choosing to value the word that was proclaimed, the word the prayers that were sent out to you. I
2:09:57
believe they will not return void. I believe I have received today. I believe I have received my miracle today. And I
2:10:02
will see it manifest. I will see it manifest soon. It must take place because this
2:10:08
anointing is real. The word will not return void and by his stripes I am healed. Amen. So declare those things.
2:10:13
Reject the devil's lies. Walk in your miracle. You'll see the miracle manifest. As you walk out your miracle
2:10:21
by walking out your faith. Faith without works is dead. Walk out your miracle.
2:10:26
Walk in faith and see the miracle manifest. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise
2:10:31
God. Oh, I also want to mention one quick thing, too. um in my book, Unlock
2:10:38
Your Deliverance, as well as YouTube videos on my you uh
2:10:44
YouTube playlist, how to receive and maintain complete deliverance. There are very important teachings of
2:10:51
how to maintain your deliverance. So, if you're new here, please make sure you get the book and or watch the videos on
2:10:58
my YouTube, how to receive and maintain complete deliverance so you can keep the freedom that you have received. Amen.
2:11:06
All right. Praise God. Will you all have an amazing night or morning or day wherever you are in the world? Much love
2:11:13
to all of you. Shine your light brighter than ever. Let your good deeds shine so
2:11:19
brightly. Hallelujah. Can't wait to see you Friday on the subscriber Q&A and Sunday.
