visitors each Sunday if you have a testimony we want to share it on the stage but we need to know about it
48:23
because if everyone raises their hands I can't call you all up here and here you know what I mean so any Sunday that God
48:28
does something or maybe it happened a while ago but you've never testified we want to share not just the videos but we
48:34
want to hear all together in the house of God and celebrate and give God glory amen so even next Sunday if you can
48:41
visit that table before church starts and share your testimony amen
48:48
so you are from Germany and I believe I was healed last
48:54
Sunday from the manic episode of um bipolar disease i had bipolar disease
49:00
for uh 25 years about so and um
49:08
uh this time I will stand on the ceiling there was u before when Todd White came
49:15
to Germany I al also uh released a cry
49:20
and uh there was no healing i could not uh stand the healing it got worse and but this time I will stand on the
49:27
ceiling and don't let the devil take it away from me so I uh have a list of
49:34
things or what uh of illnesses and so and I uh
49:43
I crossed it i crossed it i crossed a bipolar disease totally you cross off
49:48
bipolar disease that it is gone wow so what did you experience at the
49:55
conference and like after for you to say this right now i had to release a cry
50:02
when you uh were uh setting me free in Jesus name and um glory to God and
50:11
um I uh I'm a little bit sad that I did not experience uh Jesus more to see him
50:19
more is my most wish I have the biggest wish I have is to see him more and to
50:25
hear him more and okay I I hope that this will happen too that I will see him
50:32
more and hear him more amen and so ever since this conference did you find a
50:37
change in your mind more peace
50:44
more faith more faith hallelujah i also have a testimony to share so um I
50:52
was addicted to porn for a long time i always I already started at a young age because we had a a spirit of lust um you
51:00
prayed for us last Sunday and I believe I was completely delivered i haven't done it since uh for more than a week
51:07
now and I can feel beforehand for many years I've tried to
51:14
fight this addiction for 5 years and it was always a fight that was impossible for me to win like it was so frustrating
51:20
i one time I cried for longer than an hour straight and um but now it it's
51:26
finally a fight that has been possible with Jesus like it's now it was now attacked from the outside before it was
51:32
attacked from the inside and I'm so glad I'm last night I had the one of the most
51:39
beautiful moments of my life when I realized all that is possible with God and I'm also so happy with what you're
51:47
doing with your authority i think you're doing really well and that you're that you're using your authority so well and
51:54
praise God glory to God wow praise God
52:02
who the sun sets free is free indeed you are free indeed i had I used that verse
52:08
actually this week i that I found that verse and I proclaimed it every time and it's funny that you say that right now
52:15
it's prophetic it's God confirming that's God confirming to you that there's no question you are completely
52:22
free from that you were completely free and God saw your heart because because
52:28
you have a pure heart and you did not want to be doing that doing that sin you
52:35
were in bondage you needed freedom and it's only the anointing that brings freedom it's only the anointing that
52:41
destroys yoke so that was the difference this time you encountered the anointing and the yoke was destroyed
52:49
hallelujah hallelujah and I want that list that you have one
52:54
has been crossed off now of this list bipolar praise God and I want to I want
53:00
to see all of them crossed out from now so I I and I cross them out in the
53:09
spiritual realm spiritual realm and I detach you from all of these things i
53:15
break every curse off of you i break every word curse every generational curse every curse of witchcraft and I
53:22
declare every spirit attached to every one of these things they all must leave
53:28

53:36

54:25
how many years the the gentleman from Germany young man from Germany how many
54:31
years 19 no how many years did you struggle with that
54:39
when you were eight you started watching porn come come come if you could just share
54:46
that yeah so um I was I started watching it from a very young age my father had a
54:52
similar experience but I don't want to share the details of that and actually I
54:58
was freed from it once i had a moment where I was walking with Jesus on a river in the park of my city and I was
55:07
free for weeks but then I fell back to it and it got worse like I think that's
55:14
when that's when it became really impossible for me but from then on out
55:19
um it it was really bad but now it's all gone i'm free amen so you're 19 now and
55:28
so since you were eight look what God has done and this is for everyone here you know anything
55:34
you've been struggling with for many many many years Jesus wants to deliver you and heal you today right now because
55:42
his power is here this is possible amen hi Daniel daniel's from Sweden 5f Church
55:48
family from Sweden so so happy to still have you here this week as well i'm so blessed i'm so so blessed
55:57
praise God i love this ministry i love you Apostle i love Jesus i don't know
56:04
what to I'm blessed praise God i've been serving in new levels i got to shoot for
56:10
for a special project with the with a whole bunch of fivefold me five-fold
56:16
members uh at rise and shine and I've just seen things fall off me and
56:21
impartation of anointing come like uh never before while serving in this new
56:27
level and uh yeah like a lot of you guys knew and know I want to share about uh a
56:34
thing that just recently uh happened and I was super duper set free yesterday at
56:40
uh a Zoom meeting can I get this yeah we're preparing for our small groups
56:45
that are going to be beginning around the world soon and so we had a I had a
56:51
Zoom meeting uh to equip them and prepare them uh for the small groups that are about to begin so we had that
56:57
yesterday that meeting amen so I I just need to share that like I was struggling
57:03
before because of like childhood trauma uh since a young kid I would run to
57:08
really bad foods like junk food and candy and all this and overindulge since
57:14
a very young age and like spend a lot of money on it and gluttony in this area it
57:20
was a huge thing and my flesh was so strong right and so the Lord led me on a
57:25
fast last year for 30 days to eat very little and a different diet and uh I I
57:32
lost a lot of weight lost a lot of muscle it was all Holy Spirit led but I failed the the the test i got another
57:40
shot but when I went at that one for I think 30 days at the end of those I I
57:45
failed again and a lot of you guys know about this i went into gluttony super hard again and the the devil came and he
57:52
lied to me that I was an apostate and that I left the Lord and that his spirit could never come with me again and I
57:59
thought my life then would consist of now living my life without his presence until I die and go to hell and that was
58:06
the I just believed it cuz it was so strong and I failed so hard at this this
58:12
test right so I almost actually got tricked into committing suicide and I
58:17
feel so strongly to just share this because it's so powerful that the Lord
58:22
was still with me in that lie that was so heavy he was still there and he used
58:27
this i ended up in the hospital at this second try right because my BMI was 13 i
58:34
weighed like 101 pounds i had like no muscles i could barely walk or stand up
58:39
cuz I was ready to like really die for the Lord for this test cuz I wanted to be transformed but I went too hard and
58:46
so he used the hospital experience to heal me from past trauma he used the staff in the hospital to mirror me and
58:54
and give me everything I needed when I came out of the hospital after about a month uh I was completely set free from
59:02
all past childhood trauma cuz I got all the attention and healing that I needed
59:07
in there from people and and love god used these people to to love on me and
59:13
he built me up i got to eat again but then he said "Daniel you cannot bypass spiritual tests and you have to fast
59:20
this so I can remove it because I want to protect your heart for your calling so that you're not attached to this
59:25
thing that is not healthy for you because I want people to be saved through you i want people to be healed
59:31
through you and you need to be transformed for this." So I said "Okay Lord let's go." I went two first weeks
59:39
after February or something i I failed again and it was so hard this test cuz I was also working hard with my body
59:46
evangelizing and while not eating much but he gave me supernatural strength and then a day before arise and shine I knew
59:54
it was the last day and I passed the test praise God but I've never seen this
1:00:00
supernatural strength honestly like barely eating anything and working super
1:00:06
hard flying long helping people to move doing a whole bunch of stuff and he gave
1:00:12
me supernatural power to pull through and when I came the first day at Arise and Shine I uh the first day I got a hug
1:00:22
from from Pastor Heather and I fell down under the anointing on my knees when she
1:00:28
left started crying and the Lord spoke to me "Daniel you did perfect you have
1:00:34
it's it's done it's finished you're you're transformed now you don't have to do this anymore you're free i'm free
1:00:41
from this gluttony is not my portion none of that is my portion i don't have any appetite for it i started eating
1:00:48
again and it was so strange to my body to have food again right and I'm sharing this because I know somebody's going to
1:00:54
get set free today in Jesus' name so it was difficult to start eat again i I
1:01:00
felt condemnation and these voices angel of light and I struggled with like enjoying food again and I wanted to but
1:01:08
I started thinking so much about food and I was like that's not okay i want to think about Jesus only but and now I'm
1:01:14
thinking about food again and it's weird and so the devil came and the just uh
1:01:21
two two three days ago uh spoke that you know I had failed again with just like
1:01:27
eating one piece of bread too much i know some of you are struggling with this and now I I believe this lie so
1:01:34
then I went into the fast again and started isolating and was like for two weeks I'm going to go this super hard
1:01:41
fast and already where I'm at like with my muscle mass and my body weight like this if I go even harder and further it
1:01:48
can actually be dangerous again so the enemy almost got me but yesterday at the
1:01:54
Sue meeting like I hadn't told anyone about this and I was blessed with food from somebody from Fivefold Church cuz I
1:02:01
needed help right i was about to give away all my food and go on this super hard fast again and I was just started
1:02:09
crying during this sue meeting because the love of God came over me so hard and there were a lot of people actually that
1:02:15
were touched by the love of God but all of a sudden in this sue meeting that it's about the the small groups meeting
1:02:22
uh international worldwide apostle started speaking over me declaring and
1:02:27
his holy spirit through her just Daniel stop over crucifying your flesh stop
1:02:34
with this perfectionism be merry be happy and eat
1:02:40
enjoy your life with the holy spirit now hallelujah
1:02:48
Hallelujah and I was just about to go on this crazy fast and give away all my
1:02:54
food and then afterwards you have no idea how this set me free because I have
1:02:59
the ultimate confirmation and Apostle Katherine you are 100 million% from God
1:03:06
because nobody could have known that this ministry is prophetic if you're not sold on this this is it come on now
1:03:13
let's go let's go hallelujah so after that let me tell you
1:03:21
that before the Sue meeting I went and spent money in the store which I shouldn't have on like plastic utensils
1:03:27
and stuff cuz I was going to give it away to homeless right nothing wrong with that but it's not that time i spent
1:03:33
money I shouldn't have spent and all this stuff ready to give away my food had a little oatmeal half a cup of tea
1:03:39
because that's what the freaking devil was telling me loser total loser after the sue meeting I go into
1:03:46
the kitchen i have two avocado sandwiches with salmon right and an
1:03:54
omeolet and it was the best lunch of my life hallelujah

1:04:38
you Jesus wow you see the the devil comes in all these different tricky sneaky ways sometimes he comes as the
1:04:45
angel of light just sounding spiritual sounding like God and this is why we
1:04:52
need the prophetic anointing so that God can speak when we are thinking that the
1:04:58
devil's God's voice you know that's why you need to be planted that because this
1:05:04
is how God rescues this is how God redirects you this is how God open ups
1:05:09
your eyes and reveals the schemes of the devil is through his church is through

1:11:22
worship him and serve him with all your hearts ready to unite together like the day of Pentecost and this fire has had
1:11:31
already erupted for the conference so that there was worship before the conference began

you everyone could not wait to worship God and could not contain the joy and
1:11:42
excitement and praise before it even began and the fire just kept increasing
1:11:48
all the days through resurrection Easter Sunday last week last Sunday and I have

1:17:11
whole life experienced being engulfed in the fire of God with so many people
1:17:18
before the conference started people were worshiping after the conference ended people were worshiping it was like
1:17:24
uncontainable praise and joy our God is an awesome God our God is an awesome God
1:17:33
he reigns from heaven above with wings
1:17:38

from 52 nations and 41 states is more than thousand people is that God
1:17:54
changed our lives for the good sunday I went to church and then I felt like
1:18:01
something was wrong with my eyes and then Wednesday it became really swollen
1:18:06
like really really swollen one day before we come to LA it's like if the devil didn't want me to come here we
1:18:12
went like to the doctor and they said that it's not a good idea to come here because if I come here it could get more
1:18:20
swollen and they told me to take a medicine but I didn't take the medicine i had faith that if I come to Arise and
1:18:28
Shine it's going to get healed so then I came to the first session i
1:18:34
was really blessed like I felt Jesus came in my body and healed me so then I
1:18:40
went to sleep and I didn't put any medicine or didn't put like any ice packs on my eyes and then when I woke up
1:18:48
my eyes were healed the end of the conference earlier
1:18:54
that day you were speaking and you were praying over people and a weight just came off my shoulders i like before that
1:19:01
I felt tired i felt like I couldn't do anything i feel like I could run a marathon right now hallelujah god freed
1:19:09
you i want to thank God for what he did for me in the arrest and shine conference god set me free for a breast

1:19:46
many attacks of the devil towards this move of God right before this conference you all have come from 52 nations and 40
1:19:54

1:20:00

1:20:07
great is our God because the Lord says "You've been trained up you've been trained up to be

1:21:58
last year at our first 5F church conference people came from 33 nations
1:22:03
and 40 states and I was so in awe i was so That's a lot of nations you know like
1:22:10
wow and God completely blew us away this year completely surpassed all
1:22:17
expectations that people five of church family people came from 52 nations this year in one year amidst
1:22:27
and and and and and and like a month and a half prior the enemy was bringing spiritual
1:22:36
warfare was bringing attack towards this move of God in a new level new devil
1:22:41
kind of way like I'd never seen before and the fact that people came from all
1:22:48
of those nations that means that this is truly God's army just like Gideon's army
1:22:56
you know ju this is truly God's army doesn't matter how big the army looks
1:23:02
coming against you how much the enemy is trying to stop you when you are really in God's army you have the angel armies
1:23:09
backing you up you have God's power working on your behalf and it does not matter what the
1:23:17
devil tries to throw at you you will always have victory we will always have
1:23:24
victory amen and and so I am so proud of all of you
1:23:31
all of you who traveled some of you are here you're still here you've traveled i'm so proud of all of you who are
1:23:37
watching now who traveled who made the effort who made this sacrifice to travel
1:23:42
from around the world i know for many of you it was a sacrifice it was pure
1:23:47
obedience to God and your faith and making a sacrifice that you were here
1:23:53
and I'm so proud of you and I thank you i thank you on behalf of God's kingdom i
1:24:00
thank you as a leader here as a leader here at 5F Church I thank you for making
1:24:07
that effort to stand with us to stand with this army to take your place in
1:24:13
God's army to take a stand against the devil and to be obedient to God to rise
1:24:20
up and worship him with all of your hearts and receive from him what he had
1:24:27
for you i am proud of you and I thank you hallelujah all of you watching
1:24:33
online I am proud of you and I thank you god is so proud of you god is so
1:24:42
proud hallelujah you have touched God's heart so much and you have touched my
1:24:48
heart and I also want to thank all of you here here at 5F Church here in LA
1:24:54
and all of you watching online all of you who sacrificed and made
1:25:00
contributions financial contributions sewing into this work of God so that this conference would have been pos
1:25:06
could have been possible because if you didn't it wouldn't have been possible because this is how God moves he doesn't
1:25:11
he doesn't drop money from the sky he does not do that he uses people he uses
1:25:17
his children as vessels and so if you weren't obedient to that that conference wouldn't have
1:25:24
happened so I thank you so much for making that
1:25:29
sacrifice and for sewing and for continually sewing into this work of God
1:25:35
so that we can keep serving God's people and keep expanding God's kingdom all
1:25:41
over the world every week here in LA and all over the world at all of the events
1:25:47
that are to come and that have passed already amen thank you i bless you and
1:25:53
I'm proud of you amen hallelujah praise
1:25:59
God all right well today I'm going to be teaching on how to ignite revival in
1:26:07
your city in your nation in your workplace in your family wherever you go
1:26:15
how to ignite revival amen
1:26:22
i remember something that my spiritual father said and it really my spiritual father prophet Joe Davyy he said to me I
1:26:28
mean he didn't say to me he said actually it was um it was one time where he he ministered at a conference here in
1:26:35
LA um and it was it was before actually 5F church began and I I invited him here
1:26:42
I hosted him here and um there's something that he spoke when he was here
1:26:47
ministering he spoke something like this it only takes a
1:26:53
spark to ignite a wildfire a
1:26:59
wildfire doesn't begin as a wildfire a wildfire begins as a
1:27:05
spark that word stuck with me and I realized how much that word was for me
1:27:12
and that I was that spark that God was speaking in that moment
1:27:19
um I received the prophecy that I was called to be an apostle and I was called
1:27:25
to reach the nations and about a year after that prophecy was released upon my
1:27:30
life and I started after I had already started 5F Church then Prophet Joe Davyy prophesied that God has heard America's
1:27:37
prayers for revival and he is answering them now revival is
1:27:43
now and it is going to start is starting in LA spreading across the US and will
1:27:48
spread across the whole world and um from there I knew God was calling me to
1:27:54
just speak revival is now in obedience even though it didn't look like it in the physical and from there for about
1:28:02
four or so years um the church our church decreased literally every year
1:28:09
from 20some to down to two over four years each year decreasing but all
1:28:14
through that time I would declare "Revival is now." Jean Paul and I wrote a song "Revival is now your kingdom is
1:28:22
here." We we made shirts that said "Revival is now." And um I remember
1:28:28
being in our amphitheater in the park when there was just a couple of us and passionately saying revival is now and
1:28:37
um the the the truth of the matter was is there was a spark there there was a
1:28:42
spark there there was a true supernatural revival spark there in that
1:28:47
moment it had not yet caught on fire it I mean it had not caught uh into a
1:28:54
big it hadn't spread yet but there was a spark you know how powerful a spark is
1:29:02
that it can ignite a wildfire that spreads thousands and
1:29:07
thousands of acres it begins as a spark how powerful a spark is
1:29:13
amen so but one little spark if you think you're supposed to be a wildfire
1:29:18
and you are a spark but the calling for your life is to be a wildfire or is to be part of something massive to be part
1:29:25
of a wildfire and here you are as a spark it feels like impossible it feels like you have a long ways to go but the
1:29:34
thing is is that when you are in God's will when you are in his will when you
1:29:42
are in the prophetic word when you are aligned with the prophetic word with the word that God
1:29:49
has spoken over your life over the body of Christ over the the the the church the ministry that you're part of the
1:29:55
move of God if you're in line with that that spark there is
1:30:00
supernatural and with the wind of the Holy Spirit it will spread into a
1:30:06
massive wildfire that will shock you so much it will shock
1:30:12
you and so I went out in the park we were out in We were out in the park when
1:30:18
CO hit and before that we were in in in a gym and sometimes there would be
1:30:24
nobody that would show up to the worship night not a single person and we would still have worship nights and we would
1:30:30
uh uh have the live stream going not knowing if anybody was watching and that was years after starting the church but
1:30:38
we kept going we kept the spark going it was a choice to keep the spark going it
1:30:45
we could have chosen to snuff it out and stop and do something different but we
1:30:51
kept the revival is now spark ignited as a choice as obedience to God amen and in
1:31:02
God's timing that spark indeed turned into a wildfire that is spread across
1:31:08
the whole world hallelujah hallelujah and so a a lot of people they may they
1:31:16
could try to do the same thing that I did that we did they could try to do the
1:31:21
same thing they could if but but if God didn't send them if God didn't call them
1:31:26
you know if if they're just doing something in their own effort their own ambition they're doing something they're
1:31:32
they're looking like "Oh look at the success that this person had i'm going to try to copy that and do that." You
1:31:38
know they can try to do that but they will be lost forever it will not work for them if God
1:31:45
didn't call them to do this or really if God if they are not in
1:31:51
line with God's word God's prophetic word God's will because you can see something that
1:31:58
you like you can see you can see revival over here and say "I want to copy
1:32:04
copycat that but I don't want to be a part of that i love this revival that I'm seeing i
1:32:11
love this move of God that I'm seeing but I want to start that or I want to do
1:32:17
my own and put my own flavor twist to it and do make it a little more religious
1:32:23
make it a little more um less controversial you know you can be that
1:32:30
you can a lot of people do that and it won't work for them that's what I mean about it you you can be lost you need
1:32:37
the spiritual GPS god has spoken this prophecy over your life god has spoken this prophecy
1:32:44
over this move of God when you are in line with that you are following the GPS
1:32:49
and you will make it to the destination that spark that you carry will turn into a wildfire
1:32:56
but you can conjure up your own spark you can do your own spark kind of thing and it's like there's no GPS destination
1:33:04
i mean there's no GPS there's no that you you have the maps up you ever put the maps app up but you don't put the
1:33:11
destination it's like you have the maps app up and you're trying to do the same thing you know and it's it won't
1:33:19
work it's but but when you have the GPS when you have the destination in there
1:33:25
meaning God has spoken this this has been prophesied he has called you for
1:33:32
this and therefore he has equipped you for this he has released impartation of anointing to you for this and he has
1:33:40
told you how this will happen such as you need to plant yourself where he's
1:33:45
calling you to be planted you need to follow the principles of God that are in his word being planted as one of them
1:33:53
and you to need to be in order you need to be obedient you need to be
1:33:58
humble humble to the the prophetic words released to the words of direction released
1:34:06
and and if you will do that it's like you have the the the the GPS in there
1:34:12
you have the the destination in there in the the and and and you can be in a
1:34:18
barren land but not be concerned because you you know how you trust your
1:34:25
GPS like if you take a any kind of road trip like a road trip across the US or any kind of road trip you start in your
1:34:31
city that you're comfortable with and there's so much going going on but maybe you're going several hours away and then you go into a land that's so different
1:34:38
from where you came from and so different from where you're going and it
1:34:43
doesn't look a thing like where you're going and in fact it looks barren you're about you're supposed to go to a promised land to an exciting city or
1:34:49
something that's beautiful and lush and you are in the desert like
1:34:55
Nevada you are in barren land and no plants inside no tree in
1:35:02
sight but if you have the destination in the GPS plugged in you're not concerned
1:35:09
you're not worried you're not you know this is temporary and you know where you are
1:35:15
going you know you can trust that GPS you know you will for sure reach that
1:35:20
destination and this is just part of the journey this is necessary to get to the
1:35:25
destination it can't be from from uh uh LA to Las Vegas or LA to San Francisco
1:35:35
direct five minutes it can't be city city city city city lush lush lush there's going to be a desert and
1:35:41
barrenness in between there's no other way that's just the journey and so this is when I
1:35:48
received these prophecies over my life this is exciting before I received the prophecies I was pursuing music things
1:35:55
were going well i was excited this is my calling for life my for my life I believe was Christian music and it was
1:36:02
you know I was like living in like a lush city in a way in that regard in that regard you know and then
1:36:10
I received this prophecy it's so exciting it's so exciting to hear this prophecy about what God is going to do
1:36:17
revival is now you know but it's not the city right after the city the the
1:36:25
lushness right after the you I had to go through the barrenness i had to go through the desert i had to go through
1:36:31
the wilderness to get to the promised land and that was my journey that God
1:36:37
took me through just like Jesus was led into the wilderness by the Holy Spirit
1:36:43
the Holy Spirit put that that that in the GPS put the GPS in you know put that
1:36:49
in there for his journey that he would be tested in the wilderness by the
1:36:55
devil and so that's what happened for me and all the while God is saying "Keep your spark alive keep confessing that
1:37:02
revival is now keep obeying me keep your joy protect your heart keep preaching
1:37:08
keep walking keep praising keep serving every day even though you're in the
1:37:15
wilderness even though it feels like you're going backwards keep going keep your spark alive watch me turn it into a
1:37:23
wildfire in my perfect timing all you have to do is keep your spark
1:37:30
alive hallelujah and God says "Don't despise don't despise small beginnings
1:37:35
for the Lord loves to see the work begin." It's just like when you're excited to go on a road trip you don't
1:37:42
get depressed when you're in the desert when you're in the barren land on the way there do you you get excited i'm
1:37:48
getting closer i'm on the way every second I'm getting closer to
1:37:55
the promised land that's how God wants you to be that's how God wants you to
1:38:00
live in your journey with him and so how to ignite revival in your city in your
1:38:06
nation in your workplace your family wherever is you have to keep your spark alive and you need to rest knowing that
1:38:14
there is a GPS a spiritual GPS from God that you are following and you are
1:38:20
guaranteed to reach that destination if you can put so much trust in your
1:38:25
GPS how about your trust in God amen amen hallelujah but what makes the
1:38:34
difference is when you are really in alignment with what God has
1:38:42
spoken there was someone that saw what God had done and and this person might be watching right now and and they asked
1:38:49
a question they were like "How can we have this revival in our
1:38:55
church i want this in our church
1:39:01
and the answer is you have to come in alignment with what God is doing on this
1:39:08
earth right now you have to come in alignment with this move of God this
1:39:13
revival that God has brought this move of God he has brought is for the entire body of Christ it is not for one
1:39:19
ministry but it is for all ministries it's for the whole body of Christ
1:39:26
you have you know instead of doing your own thing you have to come to the same
1:39:32
GPS destination that God has put that's where the grace is that's
1:39:38
where you have your spark and there's a supernatural edge to it there i mean God
1:39:44
is putting supernatural gasoline on it like to increase it and and and there's
1:39:50
a supernatural protection over you when you're on the journey and there's a supernatural strength and joy in the
1:39:58
wilderness that God gives to you when you're in alignment with his
1:40:03
will amen and so God is speaking to the whole body of Christ now i have brought
1:40:09
revival i have brought it stop praying for it join it
1:40:15
you need to accept my anointing god is saying my power because some people want revival
1:40:22
without the power what is that the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power you need to accept my power
1:40:31
that destroys yolks that casts out demons that heals the sick that raises the dead because the devil is out here
1:40:38
trying to steal kill and destroy young children and the elderly alike and everybody in between the devil is coming
1:40:46
and trying to kill children before their time and we need to embrace the power of God
1:40:53
to resurrect these children we need to embrace the power of God to cast demons
1:40:58
out of 19year-olds that have struggled with porn addictions for seven years and
1:41:04
they don't want to be we need to embrace this anointing that heals every kind of
1:41:09
illness and delivers every kind of person from any kind of bondage we have
1:41:16
to embrace this we can't do our own thing and how God's anointing comes is is a specific way is an order is through
1:41:23
impartation is through servants he has anointed we have to accept his servants that he has chosen he has chosen
1:41:30
servants apostles prophets evangelists apostastors and teachers in the body of
1:41:35
Christ accept his ways accept his leaders accept these five-fold ministers
1:41:42
accept the anointing that moves through them accept the prophecies the prophetic words that come through them
1:41:49
and come in alignment hallelujah
1:41:56
we have this pastor a minister from Peru she comes here humbly to receive impartation of anointing and she
1:42:02
received so powerfully and she kept receiving even more today and now revival is going to break out through
1:42:10
her in Peru in the prison and wherever she ministers
1:42:17
but it's not because she looked at this revival happening and says "I'm going to
1:42:22
do my own thing my own way and I'm going to try to copycat that and try to go viral with that or
1:42:28
something cuz it's worked for them or something like that." No she humbled
1:42:34
herself and submitted herself to God's
1:42:40
will for her life and for every child of God in the body of Christ right now to
1:42:46
join his revival she went to where the anointing is the anointing that works for you is
1:42:53
the anointing you honor celebrate and respect you can't just say "Lord give me
1:42:59
anointing all the way over here just in my room just pour upon me you need to
1:43:04
honor anointing where it is moving on this earth right now and respect it and
1:43:10
receive impartation from it this is God's way that we see from the Old
1:43:15
Testament to New Testament it's his way of releasing his power of releasing his anointing is through impartation elijah
1:43:23
to Elisha Moses to Joshua Paul to Timothy this is the Bible this is God's
1:43:29
way amen hallelujah and so revival is now
1:43:34
and God is ready to ignite spread this revival that's happening in LA that's
1:43:42
happening in other places around the world he's ready to ignite this in your city and your
1:43:47
[Music] nation but you have to do it God's
1:43:53
way so the first thing you need to do is
1:43:59
carry this spark that God has given you and stay in alignment with God's
1:44:05
will don't take Don't exit out of the maps
1:44:12
app keep the maps app up in front of you keep looking at it keep remembering that
1:44:18
without it you're lost don't get all you know relaxed
1:44:26
and chill and zealous and not in a godly way and that you just
1:44:34
or maybe you want to rush things and you're like "Oh let me try this road over here."
1:44:42
instead of following the GPS and so like what has happened in my
1:44:48
life how I've seen my little spark against all odds ignite into a massive wildfire has
1:44:55
been because of the prophetic word that I believed and
1:45:01
followed the prophetic word the word of God
1:45:07
spoken was the destination and I made sure I followed
1:45:13
that the directions to get there through humility through obedience through
1:45:20
submission through through humbling myself and hearing prophetic
1:45:26
guidance through my spiritual father through my spiritual
1:45:33
leader amen hallelujah
1:45:40
and you also cannot wait for um you cannot wait for people in the
1:45:48
world to throw gasoline on your
1:45:54
spark you have to make the choice to keep your spark alive without other
1:46:00
people's opinions and cheering you on and and joining you and saying this
1:46:07
is great what you're doing i want to be a part the world will not throw gasoline on it to make it to
1:46:14
ignite it will ignite supernaturally by God through your obedience of keeping it
1:46:21
alive through your obedience of keeping that spark alive every moment you're keeping it
1:46:27
alive you're sewing supernatural seeds that will produce a mighty
1:46:32
supernatural harvest so it doesn't seem like anything's
1:46:38
happening at first you're sewing these but you're sewing seed after seed after seed keeping your flame alive shining
1:46:44
your light doesn't seem like anything's happening you may be in a wilderness like I was maybe for years I was in this
1:46:50
wilderness doesn't seem like anything's happening in fact it feels like we're going backwards but every single moment
1:46:55
of obedience every single moment of declaring revival is now every single moment of continuing to serve God do the
1:47:02
work of God shining my light keeping the spark alive was a moment that I was sewing a seed and not just any seed but
1:47:10
a supernatural seed an anointed seed because I was in
1:47:15
the prophetic word over my life i was in the will of God so it's like the anointing was
1:47:22
coming upon every seed every seed sown it wasn't a natural seed it was a supernatural seed because
1:47:31
everybody in the so what you sew you reap is a spiritual principle that applies to everybody if if anybody in
1:47:38
the world if they work really hard they will be successful you know if if anybody in the
1:47:45
world is really disrespectful to other people they will get disrespect back if they're really respectful to people they
1:47:52
will get respect back if they're generous to people they will they will have people be generous to them it's
1:47:58
just this principle in life in the spiritual realm that's not just doesn't just apply to believers but but now when
1:48:05
you do it according to God's will when you sew these seeds it's supernatural
1:48:11
seeds that you're sewing so it's supernatural harvest
1:48:16
supernatural success supernatural abundance supernatural victory that
1:48:23
takes place hallelujah
1:48:29
hallelujah so it's your responsibility to keep your flame alive don't wait for
1:48:34
people to throw gas on it you have to keep it alive god throws
1:48:40
gas on it in his timing when that harvest comes of your seed sown amen so don't look around for
1:48:49
encouragement from people don't look around for and be discouraged if people aren't um as excited as you are and as
1:48:56
on fire as you are they are in darkness and you need to be the light you are
1:49:02
needed don't look at them and say why aren't they on fire like me god sent them to you
1:49:09
why aren't they catching the fire like like I have caught the fire you have
1:49:14
just planted a seed that will someday in timing in their own free will turn into
1:49:21
a fire in their life and they will be aided but your light that you are
1:49:26
shining is meant to be a seed right now so don't be discouraged if they're not
1:49:32
being set on fire immediately like you're set on fire you were sent to them
1:49:38
amen they are in deep darkness and you are sent to them by
1:49:43
God see yourself rightly stand tall and strong and and
1:49:48
and proud of this light of Jesus not caring what anybody says not caring what
1:49:54
anybody thinks amen
1:50:01
john 1:45 philip found Nathaniel and told him "We have found the one Moses in
1:50:06
the law and also the prophets wrote about Jesus from Nazareth the son of
1:50:12
Joseph." Nathaniel answered him "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"
1:50:18
Philip replied "Come and see."
1:50:23
So in Jesus's time there was so much opposition towards him um people didn't
1:50:30
immediately catch the fire they didn't everyone didn't
1:50:36
immediately catch it only those who were humble and pure in heart could see who
1:50:41
Jesus was and caught the fire and as they shown their light the
1:50:48
fire grew as they shared their testimonies far and wide the fire caught
1:50:53
on more and more people's eyes opened up more and more people were saying all these false
1:51:00
things about Jesus but then so the army of God rose up and shared their testimonies and those testimonies
1:51:06
overpowered all of the lies spoken about Jesus all the false accusations spoken about
1:51:12
Jesus there were false accusations there were lies and there was also skepticism
1:51:17
great skepticism jesus chose chooses to use the the foolish things to confound the
1:51:23
wisdom of this world and so Jesus was a foolish thing meaning in the fact that
1:51:29
he came from Nazareth this town that is not known to
1:51:34
have really anybody doing great impressive things is not known to have
1:51:41
great spiritual leaders come from this town of Nazareth but God had him be born
1:51:47
there because he uses the weak and foolish things to confound the wisdom of this world to show his power to show
1:51:54
that nothing is impossible with him to show that it's him doing everything not
1:52:00
our talents giftings experience our networks where we've come from the great
1:52:07
city we've come from the heritage but it's only God amen
1:52:13
and so people this is one there was a great skepticism towards Jesus there was a lot of skepticism you know there were
1:52:19
some people that were skeptical because of the false accusations and then there were some people that were skeptical like nah this is not what we're
1:52:26
expecting i don't think this can be it they had in their mind this is what the
1:52:31
Messiah would look like this is where he would be from this is what the things he would say these are the actions he would
1:52:38
do they had it set in their mind and so certain things like this would
1:52:44
would come about where we have someone saying someone having immediate skepticism when Philillip is saying we
1:52:50
found we found the one the Messiah the one that the prophets wrote about with
1:52:56
great excitement and joy fire so so happy to share this good news and we
1:53:03
see we see Nathaniel immediately have skepticism and not catch the fire immediately and
1:53:11
say "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" So he's having great
1:53:18
skepticism because of where Jesus has come from and I've seen that whenever God moves in
1:53:26
great power whenever he chooses who he wants to choose he follows the same the
1:53:32
same blueprint of choosing weak and foolish things where people will say the
1:53:38
same thing can anything good come from Nazareth where this person that you're
1:53:43
saying God is using came from and I've seen that so much in my life in
1:53:51
this move of God with my spiritual father where I received this anointing from being from
1:54:00
Africa and there is that um stereotype wrong
1:54:05
stereotype like they had about Nazareth that some people a lot of people have
1:54:11
towards Africa can anything good come from Africa
1:54:17
and they they they they say so much witchcraft comes from Africa they they
1:54:23
paint this wrong picture of this beautiful continent
1:54:29
where true family in Christ live whom God loves just as much as he
1:54:37
loves us and whom God uses just as much as he uses and even more powerfully
1:54:43
and sometimes more than people from all over
1:54:48
other places in the world and so I've seen that so much i've seen
1:54:54
that that same exact skept skeptical scheme of the enemy can anything good
1:55:00
come from Africa this doubt the skepticism towards this move of God towards this revival it's the same
1:55:07
scheme of the enemy but those who have pure hearts like you have seen the
1:55:14
truth and just as people saw it just as Philip saw no this is really God doesn't
1:55:21
matter where he came from this is really God
1:55:26
this is how it is for you for many of you you have truly seen Jesus you have
1:55:32
truly seen the light you have truly seen Jesus moving in power and you don't care
1:55:39
where the anointing came from who imparted it where he came
1:55:44
from glory to God hallelujah hallelujah and so the Lord was speaking to me about
1:55:51
this he said these these pe my children these my children that are in this army
1:55:56
of God right now they are like Phillip they are like Philillip carrying
1:56:04
this great light and saying we have found we have found the light we have
1:56:10
found revival we have found what we've been searching for our whole lives
1:56:20
and and then there's many people out there in the world that are like Nathaniel what good can come from from
1:56:27
Nazareth i don't believe you even though your the fruits are there in the joy and
1:56:33
the abundant life and the freedom that your life has now there will be skeptics out there that will say "What good can
1:56:40
come from Nazareth type things to you?" But what did Philip say what did Philip do he didn't cower down he didn't
1:56:47
retreat he didn't um get discouraged he didn't second guessess but he said "Come
1:56:54
and see he stood his ground he kept shining his light he He took his place in the
1:57:02
revival army and and and was adamant i know what I know i've seen I I know what
1:57:09
I've seen and you can't tell me otherwise and I want you to be a part of this too."
1:57:15
There is this fire in Philillip and there's this fire that God has imparted to you to be his messenger to spread his
1:57:24
light everywhere you go no matter what people say no matter what the skepticism you get comes your way amen
1:57:33
hallelujah so this is how you keep your flame alive you stay strong in the face
1:57:40
of the naysayers and the critics you don't let that distinguish your light at
1:57:46
all amen
1:57:52
isaiah 9:2 "The people who walk in spiritual darkness will see a great light those
1:58:00
who live in the dark land the light will shine on them you oh God will increase
1:58:06
the nation you will multiply their joy they will rejoice before you like the joy and jubilation of the harvest as men
1:58:13
rejoice when they divide the spoil of victory for you will break the yoke of Israel's burden and the staff on their
1:58:20
shoulders the rod of their oppressor as of the battle of Midian i'm going to read this uh in the the Passion
1:58:27
translation right now and this word is so powerful this word is a prophetic word of now of what God has done and
1:58:34
what he is doing now hallelujah those who walked in darkness have seen a
1:58:41
radiant light shining upon them this is you and this is about to be so many more
1:58:48
people who are currently living in darkness and you are going to be that
1:58:54
light that extends to them because this revival started as a spark jean Tall saw
1:59:02
that spark at first it was just
1:59:08
her it was like a little light that not many people could see and then she joined that spark and
1:59:16
it became a bigger spark and then eventually more people
1:59:22
could see that light cuz it was bigger and then it grew and it grew and
1:59:28
it grew and there's 20some or more maybe 20 to 30 of you raise your hand if you've been here since 2021
1:59:35

1:59:46
this you caught the fire you saw the light you were living in darkness and you saw this light
1:59:56
and then raise your hand if you've been here since 2022
2:00:02

2:00:09
2022 and then that's more hands and then this light became bigger put your hands down 2023 if you came here in 2023
2:00:17
way more hands and then this light extended the light became bigger so now
2:00:22
you in the dark land could see this light but it was because now from if you
2:00:28
came in 2024 raise your hands and now the light became bigger so you
2:00:34

2:01:49
multiplication increased to people from 52 nations and 41 states this past week
2:01:55
and they joined us in in becoming the light of the world they joined us in becoming this fire and we
2:02:03

2:02:09
God because of this multiplication of light we have been given overwhelming
2:02:15
[Applause] joy hallelujah
2:02:24
what we experienced last weekend and what we experiencing ever since then and today this overwhelming joy is because
2:02:31
of what God has done here in this scripture that is a now scripture now you walked in darkness you saw the
2:02:38

2:03:43
army in this revival hallelujah woo
2:03:51

2:03:57
off the heaviness of persecution and you have turned what the enemy meant for evil for our good you
2:04:05
have opened our eyes to see that anything you allow is for our good
2:04:12
and the persecution that you allowed God the persecution that the devil brought as a heavy bar has turned into a
2:04:19
refining fire that has made us more transformed into your image that has
2:04:25
opened up our spiritual eyes to see the goodness of you to allow this refining
2:04:30
fire and this brings us an overwhelming and ecstatic joy and
2:04:38
rejoicing hallelujah hallelujah
2:04:43
[Applause] for you have broken the chains that have
2:04:49
bound your people and lifted off the heavy bar from across their shoulders the rod the oppressor the oppressor of
2:04:55
the Pharisees the rod the oppressor used against them he has lifted it off
2:05:02
and he has given us great joy and great victory and more fire for him
2:05:10

2:05:47

2:05:52

2:07:38
hallelujah thank you Jesus daniel it was prophetic that Daniel shared his testimony today
2:07:46
because of the word that the Lord led me to share this is a prophetic word proverbs 24:16 for a righteous man
2:07:53
listen to this a righteous man or woman falls seven times and rises
2:08:02
again [Applause] but the wicked stumble in time of
2:08:07
disaster and collapse i'm going to read this in the Passion translation for the lovers of God the true lovers of God not
2:08:15
the religious hypocrites that live in
2:08:22
lukewarmness for the lovers the true lovers of God with pure hearts that
2:08:28
truly with all their hearts all they want to do is please God the true lovers of God may suffer adversity
2:08:35
they may suffer adversity because the enemy hates them more than he hates anybody else he tries harder on them
2:08:41
than he tries on anybody else when he hears when he hears a prophetic word over their life he attacks them more
2:08:46
than he's ever attacked them in their life because he's terrified of your
2:08:51
destination as you follow the GPS the spiritual GPS from God he's terrified
2:08:58
because he's smart enough to know he's been around a while and he knows about David's in the field what they turn out
2:09:03
to be he knows about Abram who will be obedient to God and go to another land
2:09:10
and sacrifice everything and they turn out to be Abrahams
2:09:16
he knows about Moses's he know he knows them when he recognizes them when those
2:09:22
words are spoken over your life he doesn't want it to happen again like it happened with David like it happened
2:09:28
with all the leaders faith leaders in the Bible and so the lovers of God may
2:09:33
suffer adversity because the devil is terrified of you and they may stumble
2:09:38
seven times they may stumble because we are growing we're not perfect
2:09:47
we are tested but it's okay if you p don't pass the test once in a while god gives it to you again and he cheers you
2:09:54
on and he gives you what you need to pass it the next time he doesn't throw you out because you
2:10:01
failed one test he says "Get up." The righteous man
2:10:06
falls down seven times but gets rises again rise up
2:10:15
you are not called to perfection you are not called to be perfect you are called to have a heart after
2:10:21
God's sometimes having a heart after God's sometimes it means you still have make a mistake once in a while and God
2:10:28
allow God that can happen because God wants to humble you
2:10:34
so don't be hard on yourself don't beat yourself up if you make a mistake god is counting on you to rise to continually
2:10:41
rise if you have fallen down he's saying rise my son my daughter don't stay there
2:10:48
he doesn't push you down when you're down he doesn't throw you away when you're down he lifts out his hand and
2:10:53
pulls you up grab his hand don't reject his hand pulling you
2:11:00
up and I speak this prophetically i speak this prophetically cuz I remember
2:11:06
last year a powerful word came upon your life Daniel powerful word and the devil
2:11:11
was terrified so I'm speaking this prophetically to you all this word that has been released
2:11:17
over you all how you are leaders in this revival that you are so powerful in
2:11:23
Christ you need to be prepared for spiritual warfare you need to be prepared that the enemy is not happy
2:11:29
about that word the enemy is not happy about what God just did the enemy is not
2:11:34
happy about the splitting of the sea so just be prepared don't worry but just be
2:11:40
prepared just be prepared and if you ever your your faith will be tested it's
2:11:45
okay for your faith to be tested that's the only way your faith grows is when it's tested
2:11:51
there will be challenges of your faith and so if you don't get it perfect if
2:11:56
you don't get it perfect every time if you fall down one time or seven times it's no big deal
2:12:03
because many times a lot of you make mistakes but you didn't do it out of evil intentions it was genuinely a
2:12:08
mistake genuinely so don't let the devil lie to you see
2:12:15
God's hand lifting you up grab his hand accept his hand and rise again
2:12:29
hallelujah peter denied Jesus for a time peter denied Jesus for some days he
2:12:35
denied He completely denied Jesus he made a mistake big time that's a big big
2:12:41
big mistake and he was called to be a leader and so he fell down but he rose again he didn't let the devil lie to him
2:12:48
and say "Oh you shouldn't be a leader now you shouldn't even be a disciple anymore look how bad you failed how
2:12:53
could you do this you denied Jesus not one time but three times you weren't there with him when he was up on the
2:12:58
cross he rejected the devil's lies which those those lies of the devil were for sure there those lies of condemnation
2:13:05
were for sure there he rejected every single one of those lies and he was able to rise again and
2:13:12
today we are blessed by him rising we are blessed he's blessed the body of
2:13:17
Christ for eternity he stood strong and laid a foundation in the body of Christ
2:13:24
and put out an example for us to follow today and so if you fall ever you need to rise
2:13:32
again like Peter rose amen you need to be prepared to not hear the devil's lies
2:13:37
to not listen to them to not give them a moment don't look at other people and compare yourself and you don't know
2:13:44
what's happening in their lives and the devil attacks people at different times and the more powerful you are in Christ
2:13:50
the more he's going to try to stop you but you will always have victory
2:13:55
so don't compare yourself and say "I don't think I'm Look they have a more beautiful heart for God than me look
2:14:00
they shine more." Stop it that's the devil's lies god's counting on you to
2:14:05
continually rise and continually shine for him
2:14:14
that's all you need to keep focusing on that's all you got to focus on is keep rising and shining keep that light alive
2:14:20
don't let it go out amen hallelujah
2:14:27
