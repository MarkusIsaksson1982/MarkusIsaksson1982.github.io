43:50
they have some testimonies of what they witnessed and what they experienced at Revival Now Portland so Tia come on
43:58
you want to share um okay so before the event uh like it
44:04
was like a week before London I told Johno I don't think I can go to Portland because my job at the time wasn't giving
44:10
me enough days and I didn't have a steady income and then you had the word of taking care of the father's business
44:17
and he'll take care of you so it was very prophetic and then I you guys bought me the flights praise God and um
44:26
two days before the event my coworker reaches out to me and he's like "Hey like my other job has an opening like if
44:32
you want to interview tomorrow." And I go to the interview and it was so easy he just says like here's the papers like
44:38
fill them out you start tomorrow at 7:30 and I was like "What the heck?" And that was a day before Portland and
44:45
so I received that miracle before the event even happened so that was just like awesome and then dur when we got
44:53
there we had to rehearse with the worship team and I was having really bad period cramps so we were there for like
45:00
two hours and I just I had to leave because I like it hurt so bad and then
45:06
um I the next day when I was flying out it went away it was completely gone and it was kind of like it was crazy cuz I
45:13
wasn't like in the front like doing all this i was like taking pictures of people receiving so like that yeah so
45:20
that just proves like where where the anointing is you'll get healed wherever you are in the room like it doesn't
45:25
matter where you are so yeah and then uh I just saw like while taking pictures I
45:31
saw like things I've never seen before like the first lady that appeared on the screen like she got delivered of
45:39
witchcraft and she was contorting in like like weird ways I've never seen before so that opened my eyes a lot to
45:45
how powerful God is you know his anointing and then while I was sitting
45:50
down for the message the security guard he was like engaging in what you were like preaching and I've never seen that
45:56
before because you know even here like they're just doing their job like they're just a security guard like doing their job so like it was he was actively
46:04
engaging and like clapping to like what he got convicted of so that's what I witnessed at Oregon in Oregon sorry
46:12
praise God hallelujah thank you Tia praise God
46:18
and I'd love for you to share what you witnessed what you experienced um well this was my first Revival is now
46:24
event and I can just say it was not my first time watching but as I was serving
46:32
um there was these two um people who were scanning like the tickets and April
46:37
and Bethany I think her name was was there and I was um as worship was
46:44
happening um I was kind of sad but then I remember like serving like is a good
46:49
thing so as I was serving outside um many people were just coming up and saying oh what's this event about and I
46:55
was like it's God moving in power and a lot of them were like oh I like I keep seeing her posters everywhere um people
47:02
kept coming up to me and they were like you know I just I'll just get the ticket and come in and even the even the like
47:10
the SK security scanners they were like "Oh yeah like this is about to be a big event." And they were helping me um
47:17
bring people inside and it was really cool but um after the worship I finally
47:23
got to sit down um and as Tia said there was a security guard he was like "Oh
47:29
hallelujah amen i receive like every single time." He would be like "You had to receive this healing and receive this
47:35
freedom." And there was so many people um that we had passed flyers out like
47:42
the day the days before that were just coming none of them ever heard of like
47:48
your church and um let alone Jesus so when they were like "Oh yeah I I want
47:55
healing and I want this." Cuz um there was like a group of us that would just go live and then like hand out posters
48:03
um they were like "Yeah I want this." um I'll go and they actually did come like I would say like 50 only knew who you
48:10
like really were and then like a like the rest like were just there because
48:18
they just saw Jesus and through you and wanted what you like had and it was so
48:25
powerful we me and my mom and my siblings we drove 13 hours and I could
48:31
say it was so worth it and so powerful to see so many people come and receive
48:38

and wonder we have another amazing testimony to share this one's a
51:51
video that was just shared yesterday so we're going to play this right now this is from one of our 5F Church family
51:57
members who lives in Georgia who leads a small group uh as well for in the South Carolina area because she's on the
52:02
border so we're going to watch this right now this is Crystal's testimony about her daughter
52:10
hi everyone my name is Crystal Moore and I am planted at 5F Church one of the
52:15
most powerful churches in the world and I have a testimony this testimony is
52:21
pertaining my daughter Purpose a lot of you know but some of you may not know
52:26
she was diagnosed with autism she was mute she had eating problems she had
52:32
comprehension problems meaning the things that she should be able to comprehend at her age at that time she
52:39
didn't understand it something as simple as what do you want to eat or jump up or
52:45
sit down or her name or when her birthday came around i encountered God
52:51
and power in 2021 and planted myself in 2021 at Fight of Church pastorred by Apostle Katherine Creek at that time
52:58
purpose was freshly won and I didn't have a medical diagnosis at that time
53:04
but I knew spiritually that something was wrong with her mind fast forward to
53:10
the age of two she went to get an assessment done for autism and different
53:15
things during that assessment they diagnosed her with autism and usually doctors didn't like to diagnose that
53:22
young but since the symptoms that were inspiring and showcasing were so great
53:30
like purpose she wouldn't speak she would just like hum make the huming noises she would bang her head on walls
53:36
she had great problems with sensory like not wanting to bathe not wanting to use
53:41
the potty she couldn't walk on the floor without shoes or socks without freaking out she didn't brush her teeth these are
53:48
all things that Jesus delivered her from sensory things were like big time with
53:53
purpose and they even led into her having sensory issues with food the
53:59
things that I just listed they weren't small in order for us to do these things
54:04
for purpose bathe her brush her teeth teach her to go potty cuz she was terrified of the potty like you've never
54:11
seen before it was a fight she would fight you it was so that you could not
54:16
brush her teeth or bathe her or whatever you know she would literally fight you she also was having seizures as well
54:24
after getting the assessment done and getting the diagnosis since I had been planning that fight of church for some
54:29
time I knew that I could renounce this so I renounced it and we never came into agreement with that diagnosis over time
54:37
as we renounced it and I stayed planted continued to speak life over my daughter the things that she struggled with like
54:45
brushing her teeth taking a bath putting on clothes not she didn't like the feeling of clothes certain clothes loud
54:52
noises i started seeing those things fade away i'm going to be posting receipts on the screen these are just
54:59
some things that her therapist said for her age she should be able to do at that
55:05
time purpose should comprehend opposites follow two part directions and
55:12
understand new words quickly expressively purpose should have a word
55:17
for almost everything talk about things that are not in the room and use words
55:22
like in on and under purpose should use two to three words to talk about and ask
55:28
for things she should ask why a child of purpose's age may still repeat some
55:35
words so it's common for children of her age to still sometimes repeat some words but for her age she should have been
55:41
doing all of that and she wasn't and this is another assessment they did on
55:47
her they were unable to complete the assessment cuz remember she wasn't speaking it says could not assess due to
55:54
limited verbal output so they were assessing her fluency and her voice they couldn't give an assessment because she
56:01
wasn't speaking this assessment was done early on when she got the diagnosis of
56:07
autism now coming up on 4 years being planted at 5F church god has shocked us
56:13
i have always said that purpose was free from autism because of how far I've seen Jesus bring her her she's no longer
56:20
doing the things that she was doing that was indicative of autism she just
56:25
supernaturally those things fell off and she stopped doing those things we had the opportunity to get her retested
56:32
which is rare after him doing the full test on her and asking us questions and
56:38
as he's asking us questions cuz these questions are centered around autism he was asking us questions a lot of these
56:45
questions that it would have been yes but we were like "No no no no." Or she
56:50
used to she used to she used to after him doing our assessment he did his assessment with her himself he came and
56:57
sat down at the table and he said "I can't diagnose her with autism i can't
57:02
rediagnose her with autism she doesn't have autism she doesn't have autism so
57:11
something that I have been speaking because I knew it she's no longer doing the things she was doing i knew she was
57:18
free now a medical professional has put his stamp on it as well and his report
57:26
says the following autism related symptoms areas were not endorsed and
57:32
then it gives a depiction the related symptoms of autism are and it says she
57:38
has none of these she does not have autism in need more i had to break it
57:43
down but this is going to be five it'll be 4 years at 5 church i wanted to get
57:49
here and glorify God and say if he did it for me he will do it for you there's
57:54
no diagnosis too big for God to destroy when the power of God is present this
58:02
happened because I am planted that father of church this happened because there's true anointing flowing through
58:07
my spiritual leader Apostle Katherine Creek this happened because God is good
58:12
and he's faithful and he's true so what they once said my daughter has they can
58:18
no longer say she has because she doesn't and I just wanted to get up here and glorify God jesus is faithful
58:28
[Music] hallelujah [Music]

1:00:06
hi Sabrina so you live in Colorado right and you're planted from you're planted at five
1:00:11
church from Colorado welcome home and I would love for you to share your testimony of what you have received of
1:00:18
how God's touched you praise God so I found 5F in April of 2023 um my uncle
1:00:24
sent a video to my dad my dad sent a video to me and when he sent it to me I was like I don't know if that's real i'm
1:00:31
going to just ignore it and a couple weeks later my mom was listening to you a lot and she was telling me all these
1:00:37
testimonies of people being healed like online you didn't even have to touch them and then your testimony of four
1:00:43
years in the wilderness and the revival breaking out and I was like shoot there's fruit here so I was like "All
1:00:48
right Lord I'll go check it out." And I started listening to you and I was so confused because I was spiritfilled i
1:00:54
love Jesus but everything you were saying was offending me and like I felt so uncomfortable listening to you like
1:01:01
every part of me was just like gh I don't like this and I was like you know
1:01:06
back when I was younger and we would go to church um if we would go to church my stomach would like boil before I was
1:01:12
like set free and so I was like this is suspicious so I kept listening to you
1:01:17
and um I was like I'm just going to obey and see you know and so I renounced a bunch of stuff and I didn't manifest but
1:01:24
I did one like dry cough sorry and um I was like "Okay interesting interesting."
1:01:29
And then I moved on and a couple days later I was like "Why are all the colors brighter why
1:01:35
yes and um I was laughing so much i was laughing so much more it was like this heaviness got lifted off of me and I was
1:01:42
like "Okay God this is you this is you." And so um I started watching you more and more and more and before I was
1:01:49
planted I was set free of nightmares i was set free of um encountering demons at night that would like just appear or
1:01:54
like make voices like all this stuff um I was my smell returned i didn't have a smell for 2 years and then um you
1:02:02
declared anyone who can't smell must be healed now and I was like I receive it Jesus and then my smell returned um and
1:02:09
I suddenly had the overwhelming desire to smoke and I was like God this is so weird i've never smoked in my life but
1:02:15
it was all I could think about it was like it consumed me the desire and I was like this isn't me but I have no idea
1:02:21
like how to make this go away and I felt him be like you need to be planted because I was scared because of um the
1:02:28
persecution so I was scared to but I was like "Okay fine Lord i trust you." And I didn't understand why planting was um
1:02:34
important but I was like "I'm just going to obey." And so I did desire smoke completely left um I used to have if I
1:02:41
was having like a bad day or going through something hard I would have a pull towards alcohol like I would just I would crave it so bad and that
1:02:47
completely left um and it was a process it was a really big process of um
1:02:54
receiving the teachings and that's what sealed the deal with so many things so
1:02:59
um I was set free of paranoia um I was set free of anxiety and angel of light
1:03:05
so constantly having condemnation and chatter in my mind i was delivered at Flourish LA um demon manifested out of
1:03:11
me and you declared it to go i was like in the middle of the crowd i wasn't you didn't call me up it wasn't one-on-one
1:03:17
but I just fell back with the power of God when you declared every spiritual spouse to go and so I was set free of spiritual spouse and um sexual dreams um
1:03:26
and I received impartation two of my friends I explained they were telling me these issues they were having with
1:03:31
pornography and masturbation and um I explained them the principle of renouncing and I prayed for them the way
1:03:37
that you've taught us to pray for them and they were both completely set free yeah thank you Jesus and um I did the
1:03:45
ecourse testimony or the ecourse um walking in miracles ecourse and that was
1:03:51
everything changed after that ecourse it was like I had so much fear of man so I was so quiet about it but after that I
1:03:57
was like "Everyone has to know about this." And um I had another friend it
1:04:02
was the day I received impartation with the miracles ecourse um she told me that
1:04:08
she was having suicidal thoughts and depression and I was like "Girl I just received impartation today you are going
1:04:14
to get set free." And so I explained to her the principle of renouncing she renounced i released the anointing over her and she has never been the same
1:04:21
she's Yes she um she made a necklace of when Jesus set her free the date um
1:04:27
because she was she was set free of depression the suicidal thoughts the anxiety and she's just been transforming
1:04:32
every day since then and she's on fire for God now she loves him so much and it's it's so bizarre because ever since
1:04:39
you prayed for her yeah and impartation is real hallelujah and the impartation
1:04:45
from the Walking in Miracles ecourse yes so it was not in person i didn't lay a
1:04:51
hand on you to release impartation but you received it through the ecourse as you're watching online from Colorado
1:04:56
where you live wow
1:05:01
this is avail and how old are you 20 20
1:05:08
this is for all of you you can receive this too it's your birthday happy
1:05:13
birthday wow um and after after Jesus set all
1:05:22
those friends free through me um I directed them to your playlist and that was key cuz um Revival Army or which
1:05:29
playlist uh how to receive and maintain complete freedom and I like there's an important YouTube playlist on my YouTube
1:05:36
channel how to receive and maintain complete deliverance and that's what helped it seal for them
1:05:42
because um they actually watched it and then when the lies would try to come back they would use the principles that
1:05:48
they learned in that course and they were they remained free so yeah praise God um but literally no part of my life
1:05:55
is the same since encountering the anointing like I could rattle on for hours but those are like several of the big things that Jesus set me free from
1:06:01
and most of this is from online the only time I was like physically set free was when it flourish LA and when those
1:06:07
demons manifested and left and that was the angel of light so I would like constantly like hear voices like you
1:06:13
need to do this you need to do this you need to do this you need to do this and I wouldn't do it and then I would just have guilt so I always listen to stuff i
1:06:18
always had something playing because I couldn't live with quiet and after I was set free I would just sit and think for
1:06:23
like 40 45 minutes to an hour i would just like sit there and think because I was like suddenly free to be in my mind
1:06:29
you know um so yeah that was the only deliverance I received in person the spiritual spouse and um the free freedom
1:06:36
from condemnation in my mind but everything else was online and every I've had so much physical healing so I
1:06:42
used to I got pneumonia and I used to get sick every um like every month every other month for 3 to 5 days I would be
1:06:48
super sick and um after I listened to the podcast the power of your words um
1:06:53
that you have on revival is now I renounced sickness and I learned to walk in my authority and every time I would
1:06:58
feel the symptoms um they would go so I went from being sick for 3 to 5 days
1:07:04
every other month to maybe being sick for one day if we're over a year and a
1:07:09
half now yeah wow
1:07:14
praise God miracle after miracle uncountable miracles praise God
1:07:21
hallelujah god is so proud of you i am so proud of you he has such amazing
1:07:28

1:08:44
amen hallelujah hallelujah
1:08:50
hallelujah praise God wow jesus I told you awe and wonder
1:08:57
today is a day of awe and wonder woo jesus
1:09:04
god is ready to use you he's ready to use you in power to deliver the captives
1:09:10
where you are where you are your city your nation he's He's ready to use you
1:09:15
it's up to you to surrender everything you see her her testimony is powerful it
1:09:21
teaches a lot in it it teaches the the importance of of full surrender and being planted
1:09:27
the impartation came after she was planted if you don't know what being planted means this is a huge principle
1:09:34
of God's kingdom in God's kingdom for every single child of God to be
1:09:41
planted is to be in one church as a
1:09:46
disciple there not any church a church where God's power truly is where you
1:09:52
will receive the equipping the anointed teaching that equips you to have victory
1:09:58
over the enemy where you will receive anointing to heal you and deliver you
1:10:03
when you need it and a continual flow of the anointing in your life where you
1:10:09
will also receive protection in the spiritual realm it's a covering and it's
1:10:14
where you will receive impartation as well because every instance of impartation that happens in the Bible is
1:10:20
from someone being planted elisha planted under Elijah that was his
1:10:25
spiritual father one spiritual father timothy said "You have many teachers but only one spiritual father it was just
1:10:31
Elijah nobody else was his spiritual father nobody else did he receive the impartation from." Same with Joshua
1:10:38
receiving from Moses same with Timothy and the disciples receiving from Apostle Paul uh and so that's a huge key of
1:10:47
flourishing of receiving complete freedom she says that once she became planted she then received freedom in
1:10:54
another area she hadn't yet praise God um complete freedom impartation
1:11:00
and complete abundant life you have to be planted at a church where God's power is not just any church and not just any
1:11:07
church where God's power is but where God is actually calling you to be planted
1:11:13
where he's actually pulling you calling you and to be planted is a spiritual
1:11:19
principle to be planted simply means to uh be a disciple of the teachings of
1:11:26
that church so really take the teaching seriously don't miss them come to church
1:11:32
in person and if not in person if you don't if you live in Colorado or somewhere else like Sabrina you watch
1:11:38
online and you you are a a great student a diligent student of the teachings
1:11:43
where you listen to them more than one time you meditate on them you take notes you apply them amen
1:11:51
uh and you stay focused there you stay focused where God has called you to be
1:11:56
planted you focus on that equipping specifically
1:12:01
amen to be planted also means to be contributing to the work of God there to
1:12:07
be sewing to be contributing with your service and also financially as God calls that all of all of his children to
1:12:14
tithe amen and you receive you reap from that anointed ground there as you
1:12:20
contribute as you sew as you serve more anointing flows upon your life to take
1:12:26
care of every need amen so that's what it means to be planted to be a disciple
1:12:33
to be receiving the teachings regularly diligently focused there to contribute
1:12:40
to the work of God to sew to serve that's what it means simply to be planted and so um we have people planted

shared yesterday and I was so touched i was left in awe and I want everyone to
1:20:03
hear it i know many haven't heard it yet so could you share your testimony of what happened when you read the book
1:20:09
Unlock Your Deliverance with your sister so um I've been reading the book Unlock
1:20:17
Your Deliverance with one of my older sisters she lives in Baker in Barstow so
1:20:22
um we get on FaceTime and read a chapter a day and so two weeks ago on a Saturday
1:20:27
night it was my turn to read and it was chapter 10 so and chapter 10 is time to
1:20:36
be free chapter it is where like me as the author I lead
1:20:43
you through renouncing and then I declare over you through the book yeah so um that whole day you know I
1:20:50
didn't want to read i was getting tired and I know now it was actually a demon
1:20:57
trying to stop me from reading your book that chapter so I start reading with my sister and um she's new to the anointing
1:21:04
she's new to the new wine so we're reading and it gets to the prayer of renouncing and as I'm renouncing I come
1:21:11
up to the words soul ties the spirit of death spirit of murder and tormenting
1:21:16
dreams and I start getting quiet and I start crying
1:21:22
and I could literally feel this demonic spirit holding my mouth shut not letting
1:21:28
me say these words and so I keep going i keep going and I'm trying I know I'm manifesting so I try
1:21:36
not to show it so much so I don't scare my sister because I know she's new to this she's new to deliverance
1:21:42
and then when it comes to your name where it says Apostle Katherryn Crick speaking like it would not let me talk
1:21:48
it would not let me say your name and that's where in the book it says Apostle Katherryn Crick is speaking and that's
1:21:53
where I say I declare every spirit must go and so I feel my body just you know
1:22:00
start getting warm and the Holy Spirit reminds me of my favorite scripture Jeremiah 29:11
1:22:07
and so I'm able to say your name and we keep going and after that it leads into
1:22:13
the baptism of the Holy Spirit and I just start feeling warm and warm my stomach starts bubbling and so I tell my
1:22:19
sister I'm going to put you down the phone down real quick and I'm going to go to the restroom so I run to the restroom and I start coughing and
1:22:25
throwing up and I just feel so much peace as this is
1:22:30
happening so I finish and I wash my face wash my mouth I try to go to my phone like
1:22:35
nothing happened and I pick up my phone I look at my sister and she's crying
1:22:41
she's like "Brother this is a testimony you're free." you know and since then
1:22:47
it's like I've been so much at peace like I've been planted here at 5F as
1:22:52
well as True Grace with my spiritual parents Pastor Heather Apostle Larry and it's like every time I come I listen to
1:22:59
your guys' teaching and the equipping that you give us and just applying it knowing that I've been dealing with this
1:23:05
problem for a long time since I was a kid and you know it's like everyone says
1:23:11
deliverance has happened in layers and it was God's timing that it was time to get free and I stand here today a free
1:23:20
man of this these tormenting dreams the spirit of death and murder like these soul ties and I'm just so happy and so
1:23:28
much at peace and it's like I look back and it's like wow it's so amazing that
1:23:34
your anointing is so strong and I thank God for using you as a vessel i honor you Apostle Katherine your book is so

1:24:33

1:24:39
oppression for people in dark places he's putting a heart in you to go out to
1:24:44
them to reach them and to share this good news with them hallelujah and I see
1:24:51
God using you so powerfully to reach these people that are in a dark place right now where you once were in your

praise God hallelujah
1:25:32
hallelujah revival is now
1:25:42
hallelujah hallelujah
1:25:47
the axe church is alive i'm thinking of the scripture where it talks about the apostles performed signs and wonders
1:25:53
many were added to their day to their to the church every day and the city was
1:25:59
filled with great joy this church is filled with great joy
1:26:05
today amen jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus
1:26:11
hallelujah this is truly a new level a new phase in this revival hallelujah
1:26:17
thank you Lord praise God praise God this good news has to get out
1:26:26
it has to get out all of these testimonies which are just a fraction of what God is doing in his
1:26:32
true revival that is now this word has to get out
1:26:39
we can't keep quiet about our Jesus and what he's doing
1:26:46
it says in Romans 10:13 "For everyone who calls
1:26:51
on the name of the Lord will be saved and they will be healed and they will be delivered they will be set on fire and
1:26:57
they will receive abundant life but how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him and how
1:27:04
can they believe in him if they have never heard about him that's right
1:27:10
this is this is the Bible saying this this is the Bible how can they believe
1:27:16
in him if they have never heard about him how can they receive deliverance if they
1:27:24
have never heard about Jesus delivering people how
1:27:30
they can't that's the point of you have to hear to believe
1:27:36
it's when people hear the good news that they believe and they receive Jesus
1:27:44
how will people hear if you are afraid of persecution to spread the good news
1:27:49
if you're afraid of what people will think about you how will they hear how will they be free
1:27:56
oh it is worth it it is worth any kind of persecution
1:28:02
it is worth losing your ego it is worth having enemies and haters
1:28:09
to speak the good news that will set people free and lead them to Jesus lead them to salvation
1:28:15
it is worth it we have to get this good news out people
1:28:22
of God Lord how many people are in LA several
1:28:28
million i think it's Is it 4 million almost 10 million what 11 million
1:28:36
11 million people are in LA jesus 11 million jesus
1:28:44
how many of those people know Jesus how many of those people are bound how many of those people have heard of Jesus are
1:28:50
Christians going to churches with no power and are bound by demons in this city alone
1:28:58
many of them many
1:29:03
oh it's time to have urgency in your heart people of God
1:29:10
revival army
1:29:17
do you hear what God is doing just this week we have to have a long
1:29:24
service here because to give God glory we need all this time adequate glory we have there's
1:29:31
so many testimonies we can't have a short service
1:29:37
hallelujah this is just a fraction this is just a fraction there's people
1:29:43
part of this revival all around the world more than 160 nations they're a part of it and so look at us around here
1:29:49
look at look around this is small the testimony shared today this is small even
1:29:55
but even if it was just this is mindblowing even if it was just five testimonies
1:30:02
this this doesn't happen often many people are bound by these things for their life their whole life and they
1:30:09
don't know how they can be free they don't know how to be free we have to get the word out people of God we have to
1:30:16
get the word out hallelujah
1:30:22
i feel the Holy Spirit impressing this urgency
1:30:28
how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him and how can they
1:30:33
hear about him unless someone tells them
1:30:40
who will tell them you you god is counting on you to tell them
1:30:50
and how can they hear about him unless someone tells them and how will anyone go and tell them without being sent that
1:30:57
is why the scriptures say "How beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news."
1:31:03
God is sending you out i commission you as your spiritual leader spiritual mother i commission you to go out
1:31:12
and spread this good news i commission you to go out and pray for
1:31:17
the sick and those oppressed like we've heard has been happening in
1:31:23
Colorado i commission you i give you permission i send you out
1:31:33
share this good news we have to get the word out
1:31:39
this is too small we are too small right now
1:31:46
compared to the city of LA there's so millions of people oppressed
1:31:53
come on we have we have to take it up a notch the fire we have to have more
1:31:58
urgency hallelujah and in this new phase of revival this is
1:32:04
what God is speaking it's time to go out with passion with fire with boldness
1:32:11
with urgency with sacrifice and full surrender to God
1:32:17
it's time to have compassion for the people out there who have not yet
1:32:22
received what you have received and it's time to have passion for them to receive
1:32:28
our Jesus this anointing and step into revival
1:32:35
i'm fired up because I I I we heard the testimony of what just sharing the good
1:32:41
news just getting out there and spreading flyers we heard the testimony today it works
1:32:47
every seed you sew God moves upon it he moves upon every seed you sow
1:32:55
god's saying "It's up to you i've released this revival to you here
1:33:00
in LA i've released it to you now it's up to you to steward it now it's up to you to
1:33:06
share this good news and bring people in sheep produce sheep
1:33:13
sheep produce you as sheep are to produce more sheep that's your job
1:33:21
this is what the scriptur is saying how will they hear if they're not told that means that God isn't going to just speak
1:33:27
in an audible voice revival is now from the heavens
1:33:32
go to 5F church to encounter God's power no this scripture shows us that he
1:33:38
commisss us to go and spread the good news and they won't hear unless we tell
1:33:45
them hallelujah
1:33:51
it's time to go and evangelize to go and share this good news with all
1:33:58
of your heart pe people aren't here because they
1:34:05
haven't heard not because they don't want Jesus do you know how many people want freedom they just don't know that
1:34:11
it's here for them the harvest is ripe come on laborers it's time to go out
1:34:19
hallelujah hallelujah praise God
1:34:25
so I'm I I'm I'm going to I want to teach today now that God is really speaking this with urgency to go out and
1:34:32
spread this good news with all of your heart i want to teach you today how to represent Jesus rightly as you go out
1:34:39
how to shine your light accurately with excellence not just any old way but how
1:34:45
to be the most effective to share this good news so that people will be
1:34:50
attracted and want to come and receive Jesus amen amen
1:34:56
hallelujah
1:35:01
so in the kingdom of God there must be balance
1:35:07
there must be balance it's it's this is a kingdom principle that there must be balance by this I mean here's one
1:35:14
example i'm going to give you some examples of how you must have balance so we must ask God for the desires of
1:35:22
our heart the Bible says you have not because you have not asked
1:35:27
you need to knock on the door you need to seek and then the door will be opened upon opened for you then you will find
1:35:34
so we need to pray we need to ask God we need to boldly ask him for the desires
1:35:40
of our heart the godly desires of our heart but when we ask God for things for our
1:35:49
our our prayer requests at the same time we need to have the balance of allowing God's will to be
1:35:57
done we need to have humility to know that every desire of our heart may not
1:36:02
be God's will even if it's a good godly desire and we also need to know about God's
1:36:08
timing we can really want something soon and that can be what we're asking for but God actually has planned to give it
1:36:14
to you later so when you boldly with faith ask for things from God you need to also have
1:36:21
balance to allow God's will to be done so you boldly ask with faith i believe
1:36:28
that God will answer my request ask and you shall receive
1:36:34
but at the same time I humble myself let let your will be done not mine God
1:36:40
if this is not your will then I don't want it you see that balance
1:36:47
this is what I mean by the the the kingdom of God the principle of balance also
1:36:53
um for the promises of God to come to pass for the promises of God we are called to be expectant we are called to
1:37:01
be like the virgins who kept their oil they they kept oil in their lamps to keep to keep their their fire burning we
1:37:08
are called to be like that to be expectant that the promises will be fulfilled any moment now
1:37:14
god wants us to have that expectation and to be ready instead of oh it's been
1:37:19
a long time i guess I'll just stop expecting now no we must have expectancy
1:37:25
that's faith we must be ready for when the promise comes because that's part of us being prepared to walk in the promise
1:37:33
but there needs to be balance there needs to be a balance of being content
1:37:39
in the waiting so it's this balance of being so
1:37:45
expectant but it not coming yet but you're not getting weary you're not
1:37:51
giving up with being expectant you're not blaming God because he got you you
1:37:58
think he got your hopes up or something you feel disappointed no you you are content in the waiting because you know
1:38:04
that you don't know what God's timing is but it's perfect and you know that you have surrendered and submitted to God's
1:38:10
timing so that means you should not complain you should not give up you know what will come but in his timing
1:38:18
so there must be balance there as well also
1:38:25
when it comes to uh spending time with God spending time
1:38:30
in the word in prayer worship
1:38:36
it's important to be expectant that God is going to speak he's going to speak through the word for example
1:38:43
but at the same time you need to give God control of your relationship with
1:38:48
him you need to be okay with however he wants to speak to you with however he
1:38:56
wants the intimacy w you to look like because sometimes people are always
1:39:02
wanting a feeling or sometimes people may always want a powerful revelation when they read the Bible but sometimes
1:39:09
maybe you'll read something in the Bible and you don't have this wild profound revelation
1:39:15
but you ate the word of God nonetheless and you were spiritually equipped even though you didn't feel it and sometimes
1:39:22
even you'll get revelation later on after what you read a revelation will
1:39:28
come god will speak to you later bringing to remembrance what you read
1:39:33
and speaking to you amen so you have to have that balance of being expectant in your time that you
1:39:41
spend with God for him to speak for him to move for him to touch you but have that balance be okay if it's not some uh
1:39:50
physical feeling you have but he comes in a in a still small voice type way
1:39:57
amen just like when you're with friends like sometimes you some of you may have gone
1:40:03
through this before in your life sometime I know I used to go through this when I was a teen if it was quiet I
1:40:10
felt like it wasn't exciting or I wasn't being exciting enough so I would feel like I had to fill the space and always
1:40:16
talk and I felt like that was what real intimacy was and excitement and where
1:40:22
you're really connecting is when you're talking like every single second but if you're with someone for a long period of
1:40:27
time it's okay for there to be silence sometimes sometimes that's what's best sometimes it's just noise if you're just
1:40:34
trying to fill the gap the noise fill the space you know so that's like how it is with God sometimes we can be so force
1:40:40
you can be so forceful trying to make your relationship with God so exciting
1:40:46
when it's inauthentic and it's it's controlling the relationship instead of
1:40:51
allowing God to control the relationship you know so there needs to be that balance
1:40:58
of expectancy but allowing God to be in control of the relationship amen
1:41:05
and um another example of of having balance is
1:41:11
when you come to church when you come to church where God's power is god's power moves and God's power makes people to
1:41:18
fall back with his power sometimes sometimes demons are cast out of people and demons shriek as they leave
1:41:25
sometimes the Holy Spirit comes upon people and they are weeping sometimes the Holy Spirit comes upon people and
1:41:31
they feel warm they feel the fire of the Holy Spirit sometimes people are baptized with the Holy Spirit and start
1:41:36
speaking in tongues there's a lot of different beautiful manifestations of the Holy Spirit that happens in the
1:41:43
church where God's power is and you maybe some of you maybe you got delivered and when you first encountered
1:41:51
God's power you were delivered and it was a radical encounter with God it was extremely
1:41:59
tangible you really physically felt God
1:42:05
i mean maybe you fell back maybe you felt the anointing come upon you heat
1:42:11
etc but it was such a physical tangible encounter with God
1:42:16
but it's not supposed to be that way every single time you were set free now
1:42:23
you're not going to need to be set free again and again so therefore you're not going to have the same physical
1:42:28
experience every time but you have to be careful that you don't associate
1:42:35
encounters with God with the first experience you had where it was full of
1:42:40
a physical uh tangible touch
1:42:46
amen and I shared this in a message maybe a few months ago or so but I want to speak
1:42:52
this again i know maybe you didn't some of you didn't hear it but I shared how when you come to church you shouldn't be
1:42:58
coming with the purpose with the motive of having an experience
1:43:05
you shouldn't come with the motive of having an experience so you can feel
1:43:10
like God loves you more cuz maybe you feel insecurity so you need to feel something you're coming so
1:43:17
that you can feel something so you can have more confidence about God's love for you and that he's near you you
1:43:24
shouldn't come with that motive you should come with a motive simply to come
1:43:30
and encounter Jesus and allow him to have his way with you
1:43:35
and what that will look like most of the time is being discipled and transformed
1:43:41
because this anointing is so powerful once you're free you don't need to keep being free once you're healed you don't
1:43:47
need to keep being healed maybe the enemy will try to attack sometimes and you'll need a healing maybe months later a year later but I mean when you're
1:43:54
swimming in the anointing covered in the anointing you're not going to be needing constant healing
1:44:00
there's a protection over you in the spiritual realm so once you're healed and freed you're
1:44:06
good like you're you're ready now to be a disciple to to to be made a disciple
1:44:14
you're ready to be equipped you're ready to transform spiritually and you're ready eventually to start
1:44:20
receiving impartation but to be so like like your purpose on this earth is to lead others to Jesus
1:44:26
your purpose on this earth is not to constantly have physical experiences that make you feel better about yourself
1:44:33
and your relationship with God you know so you need to come to church knowing
1:44:40
I'm here to be discipled i'm here to be transformed to be equipped for my spiritual eyes to open up more about the
1:44:45
spiritual realm and the schemes of the devil so that I can have victory over the devil so I can be strong in my own
1:44:51
personal life so then I can fulfill my purpose of being a powerful vessel of God for others to help others to lead
1:44:57
others to Jesus to cast demons out of others to heal the sick so I can be totally focused on helping other people
1:45:04
not my own spiritual life amen
1:45:09
so um to be equipped you don't need to have a physical touch a physical
1:45:15
tangible experience to be equipped it's a spiritual thing to be equipped amen
1:45:21
and God will come when he wants maybe with a fresh fire of his spirit he will come his Holy Spirit will come and touch
1:45:27
you and surprise you and you'll physically feel him sometimes but it's important for you to not be
1:45:33
seeking that as if feeling him physically means he's closer
1:45:40
it's important you're not feeling down on yourself like you're missing something if you're not feeling him
1:45:45
physically god is a spirit
1:45:51
he's a spirit you can't see him but he's there
1:45:58
and it says in uh uh John 20 24
1:46:05
one of the 12 disciples Thomas nicknamed the twin was not with the others when Jesus came they told him "We have seen
1:46:12
the Lord." But he replied "I won't believe it unless I see the nail wounds in his hands put my fingers into them
1:46:19
and placed my hand into the wound in his side." Eight days later the disciples were together again and this time Thomas
1:46:25
was with them the doors were locked but suddenly as before Jesus was standing among them "peace be with you," he said
1:46:31
then he said to Thomas "Put your finger here and look at my hands put your hand into the wound in my s side don't be
1:46:37
faithless any longer believe." My Lord and my God Thomas exclaimed then Jesus
1:46:42
told him "You believe because you have seen me
1:46:48
blessed are those who believe without seeing me you believe because you have seen me
1:46:54
because you have felt me blessed are are those who believe without seeing me or
1:47:00
feeling me." Now it is important you know most for for
1:47:06
for probably most if not every believer God wants them to have an encounter with
1:47:12
God's power where they feel him especially like the baptism of the Holy
1:47:17
Spirit like I know for me that was when I was baptized Holy Spirit like my tongue was overtaken like that's the
1:47:25
first time I like felt Jesus that was supernatural I mean speaking in tongues
1:47:30
That's God on the tongue whoa hallelujah and it changed me
1:47:36
forever it opened up my eyes but it was like a burning bush experience
1:47:41
god God gave the burning bush as a to get Moses' attention to to to to lift
1:47:47
his faith so much to open his spiritual eyes so he could then walk by faith and do what God had called him to do that
1:47:54
was the purpose of the burning bush notice that there's not a burning bush every day
1:48:00
with Moses once your eyes are open you see
1:48:07
you once your eyes are opened you can see in the spiritual realm
1:48:12
you don't need your eyes to be reopened again and again and again once God has opened up your spiritual eyes when he
1:48:19
comes in power in this tangible way many times like deliverance or the baptism of the Holy Spirit or a prophetic word um
1:48:28
your spirit a big purpose of God doing that is opening your spiritual eyes so you can see how good he is how much he
1:48:34
loves you how faithful he how faithful he is and now that you see his goodness his love his faithfulness that then
1:48:41
moves you to surrender to him but then your surrender surrendered to
1:48:46
him and now your eyes have seen and you're just ready to follow him your eyes have se you're ready you don't need
1:48:53
to keep having those same experiences in fact God doesn't want you to have those same exact experiences because
1:49:00
that means you're not walking by faith that's why God says "Blessed are you who
1:49:06
believe without seeing or feeling." Because the Bible says you can't please
1:49:12
God without faith everything in the kingdom comes by faith
1:49:21
and even like for leaders it's important that the faith is built so strong so you
1:49:27
so you so you were there as an example for others so you can say I didn't feel
1:49:33
anything I didn't see anything but I kept believing and I kept going and God was faithful
1:49:42
so God wants that he wants that lack of seeing and feeling the physical senses
1:49:48
involved so that your faith can grow that's the only way the faith can grow
1:49:53
and that's the most important thing to him that's how he accomplishes everything
1:49:58
that's how he does miracles is by people believing in him without seeing having
1:50:04
faith hallelujah
1:50:10
hebrews 11:1 says "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for and the
1:50:16
evidence of things not seen." This is the amplified version the conviction of their reality faith comprehends as fact
1:50:23
what cannot be experienced by the physical senses faith comprehends as fact what cannot be
1:50:32
experienced by the physical senses
1:50:41
hallelujah so there needs to be that balance when you
1:50:47
come to church that you are expectant for God to touch you but that you give
1:50:53
him you surrender to him you're not like "Oh I really just want to feel him
1:50:58
because then I'll I'll feel better about myself i'll feel better about my
1:51:05
relationship with him i really just need to feel him
1:51:10
you shouldn't have that kind of expectancy you should have the expectancy lord I know you will touch me
1:51:16
today whether I feel anything or not I know you will touch me in the spiritual
1:51:22
realm whether there's a physical manifestation of what happened in the spiritual realm or not
1:51:29
I'm expectant for you to touch me today for you to speak to me today for my life to be changed by you by your power today
1:51:37
and I surrender to you with however you want to do it
1:51:42
balance rather than be forceful with your expectation that it must be this
1:51:47
way that it must be some physical experience
1:51:53
this is very important that we have this balance because in all of these areas that I just mentioned if you don't have
1:51:59
this balance you can open up the door to the angel of light the devil masquerading himself as an angel of
1:52:04
light that's why you have to have this balance
1:52:09
instead of being strictly I must experience God this way because God will
1:52:15
be over here not in this way but you're like no he must come this way okay and
1:52:20
so then the angel of light can easily deceive because you're not even being open to
1:52:27
God coming any other way so you take whatever is coming this way because it's fulfilling the desire you want so you
1:52:35
refuse wisdom you refuse discernment
1:52:40
because you are not surrendered and you are just wanting it to be this way
1:52:46
it says in uh first Kings 19:11
1:52:53
"The Lord said to Elijah," go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord for the Lord is about to pass
1:52:59
by then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the Lord but the Lord was
1:53:05
not in the wind after the wind there was an earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake after the earthquake came
1:53:12
a fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire came a gentle whisper
1:53:17
when Elijah heard it he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave then a voice said
1:53:23
to him "What are you doing here Elijah?"
1:53:29
So there was wind earthquake and fire and God wasn't in all of those
1:53:38
but in the past God has come through earthquake wind and fire and that's quite exciting the earthquake
1:53:44
wind and fire you know it it says in Matthew 27:50 you know when Jesus had
1:53:49
cried out again in a loud voice when he was on the cross he gave up his spirit at that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom the
1:53:56
earth shook the rock split and the tombs broke open so this speaks that there was
1:54:01
an earthquake when Jesus died when he was crucified
1:54:06
and then Matthew 28:1 after the Sabbath at dawn on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went
1:54:11
to look at the tomb there was a violent earthquake for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and going to the tomb rolled back the stone and sat on it his
1:54:18
appearance was like lightning and his clothes were white as snow so at the resurrection there's also an earthquake
1:54:24
a violent earthquake so God was in those earthquakes there
1:54:31
also God God has been in the wind before acts 2:1 when the day of Pentecost came they were all together in one place
1:54:36
suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house they were sitting so God
1:54:42
has come in the wind too before exodus 3:2 there god has also come in the fire
1:54:47
there the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from the within a bush moses saw that through the bush was
1:54:53
on fire it did not burn up so God does sometimes move through the
1:54:59
earthquake wind and fire but in this instance he was coming in a still small voice it was so important
1:55:06
for Elijah to be surrendered to not be like "Oh God's about to pass by i'm so
1:55:12
excited to have a burning bush moment like Moses did to see him come in fire
1:55:19
to see him come like the day of Pentecost in the wind to see him come like earthquake like he has before
1:55:26
it's so important for him to surrender and and where surrender to God where you keep your wisdom and discernment and
1:55:33
balance and know that there's balance too and be able to discern where God is
1:55:39
speaking this time in this still small voice
1:55:45
amen hallelujah
1:55:56
praise God so in the new wine in the new wine there
1:56:04
was order god has order and when I say new wine I mean the Jesus way the the
1:56:11
the the doctrine that Jesus preached the revelation he carried from the Holy
1:56:16
Spirit of the word of God of God's ways when he came in the Gospels
1:56:24
you know the way that he was preaching was different from the ways of the Pharisees preaching
1:56:31
even though they're worshiping the same God and they're reading the same word of God
1:56:38
old wine is different from new wine and in the church today by and large there
1:56:44
is so much old wine so many different doctrines that are
1:56:51
actually coming from the old wine and not from truly the revelation of the Holy Spirit the new wine
1:56:58
so in the new wine which was what God is restoring in this revival
1:57:06
there must be order god is a God of order not chaos or confusion
1:57:11
he is a God of order and so we have to keep that in mind
1:57:18
we have to keep that in mind so that we don't just go halfhazardly however we
1:57:24
want behave however we want
1:57:29
what you see today by and large is lack of balance you find churches that are
1:57:35
opposed to the holy the movement of the Holy Spirit the manifestations of the Holy Spirit they're on one extreme
1:57:43
but then there tends to be another extreme where the people are so open to the manifestations of the Holy Spirit
1:57:51
they love the manifestations of the Holy Spirit that they go wild not in a good way but in a bad way
1:57:59
no order no balance no self-control
1:58:08
it says in Galatians 5:22 "But the Holy Spirit
1:58:13
produces this kind of fruit in our lives love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and
1:58:20
self-control." So what happens so much of the time in
1:58:29
churches that embrace the movement of the Holy Spirit they get they get so
1:58:34
excited about the gifts so zealous
1:58:39
but they don't want to have self-control they prophesy out of order they prophesy
1:58:47
things that God's not even speaking that it's the angel of light speaking they prophesy things that you know God
1:58:53
just wasn't calling them to prophesy yet because they need to be matured first to really have wisdom to know this is
1:59:01
prophes this is a prophetic word from God this is not this is yourself this is the angel of light and also the wisdom
1:59:08
to know when to speak something and when to not to have the wisdom to know this is just something God's revealing or
1:59:13
maybe this is just your imagination or this is something God's revealing but it's not for you to speak to somebody
1:59:20
it's just something you're seeing in the spiritual realm because your spiritual eyes are open you know
1:59:26
um so this is what I'm this is what I mean by the importance of balance when I say balance I'm meaning self-control
1:59:33
self-control of the Holy Spirit to be sensitive to God's order God's timing
1:59:38
instead of just doing however you feel we get so excited about Jesus but we
1:59:44
have to know he is a God of order we get so excited about the spiritual gifts and manifestations but we have to know he's a God of order and the Holy Spirit has
1:59:51
self-control we have to have self-control hallelujah and walk in wisdom
1:59:57
amen hallelujah so
2:00:04
now I after sharing all this I want to share I want to share all this with you
2:00:09
as a foundation to have this foundation to now know how to evangelize and
2:00:16
represent Jesus rightly as you evangelize
2:00:22
the best way to evangelize and share Jesus with others and share revival and
2:00:27
share about what God is doing is to
2:00:33
put in your heart put in your mind that you must have compassion for people
2:00:44
rather than just do however you feel
2:00:49
you must give them what they need the good news you must
2:00:55
attract them to Jesus you You must be sensitive
2:01:00
what will make them be drawn to Jesus that's having compassion for them
2:01:07
and sometimes that means restrain sometimes that means self-control amen
2:01:18
matthew 9:35 it says Jesus went through all the towns and villages teaching in their synagogues proclaiming the good
2:01:25
news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness when he saw the crowds he had compassion on them
2:01:33
because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd
2:01:40
so to represent Jesus rightly God wants you to have this kind of compassion
2:01:45
where you're really seeing people you know and so when you go out when
2:01:51
you're going out to share this good news the good news with people really have compassion for them and have that heart
2:01:59
for them i really want them to be one into the kingdom i don't want to do
2:02:04
anything that would make them confused that would make them
2:02:11
not want to come and receive i want to be attractive i want to demonstrate God
2:02:16
with excellence and how you do this is keeping in
2:02:22
keeping in your heart this verse that speaks of the fruits of the Holy Spirit
2:02:29
show the fruits to people love joy
2:02:35
peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness
2:02:41
and self-control amen
2:02:47
so sometimes the self-control just I the self-control and balance we must have is to know the time to be to be wild like
2:02:56
be wild among your fellow believers and be full of joy and full of love but
2:03:04
really after others like having a heart for other people as you speak to them
2:03:13
what I mean by this is like on the day of Pentecost the fire of the Holy Spirit came and people are so filled with the
2:03:20
Holy Spirit they're drunk acting and but there was something God was
2:03:25
doing through this per through a purpose through this because they were speaking in different tongues and it was making people hear praises of God through their
2:03:31
tongues so there was a purpose to that specific um wildness that was going on
2:03:39
but shortly after that Peter you know Peter would have been baptized in the Holy Spirit imagine Peter is receiving
2:03:45
the Holy Spirit for the first time and he's just witnessed so many of the other
2:03:51
disciples experience the Holy Spirit for the first time and this is the first time like we all have already heard about this when we before we've heard
2:03:57
the Holy Spirit like this is the first time and like Jesus was dead like gone
2:04:02
they thought you know now they now they're realizing he's actually here with us it's like he's here alive in us
2:04:10
like imagine for the first time just put yourself in their in Peter's
2:04:15
shoes right what would you want to do that day on the day of Pentecostal
2:04:25
you know it was it would honestly take discipline self-control
2:04:30
to get off the floor get up off the floor where you're laughing
2:04:37
and just want to just have a 20our praise party
2:04:42
and go and speak with composure to people about Jesus
2:04:50
but how scripture goes is they're baptized in the Holy Spirit they're speaking in tongues they're full of the
2:04:55
joy of the Lord they're looking like they're drunk and like right after that Peter goes and he just speaks with
2:05:02
composure you know the gospel and the Bible says 3,000 were led to Jesus that day
2:05:12
so many people in their in their carnal thinking when they think that it's all about a physical experience they could
2:05:19
think that if I just you know I just hit get hit by the Holy
2:05:25
Spirit in the middle of the preaching some people could think "Wow that was the most powerful service
2:05:31
we had." The way God came and touched Apostle Katherine you know but that's
2:05:37
not spiritual glory to God god is in me
2:05:42
he's in me you know we don't need to have a physical experience to have that like
2:05:49
evidence that he's really moving right now through the word that he's really moving right now through the service
2:05:56
what God needs for the people right now for you right now is for you to be
2:06:02
equipped for you to hear the word that's what's really important right now not for God to strike me down so I can start
2:06:10
laughing being full of the joy of the Lord right now he needs the message to go forth that can happen later not right
2:06:16
now in my own time with God but right now I need to be of composure and speak
2:06:22
clearly the message to you because this is what God needs to be done this is
2:06:28
having compassion for the people
2:06:34
you know I mean man after hearing these testimonies I have to be like okay
2:06:40
preach like it takes self-control sometimes you can probably tell I'm like "Wow I'm in it all."
2:06:47
[Applause] You know it takes self-control to to
2:06:54
just have be be obedient to the Holy Spirit okay I want you to preach the word now
2:07:01
with clarity with focus with a heart for the people
2:07:10
amen amen so you see that balance among each other in the upper room
2:07:16
they're filled with the Holy Spirit they're drunk with the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit's like "Quick go i know
2:07:22
you want to stay there but I want you to compose yourselves and preach be the light of the world
2:07:28
and I need you to speak clearly because otherwise they won't hear you they won't know what's going on they'll think you're weird they'll something's wrong
2:07:34
with you mentally or something and they'll leave they need to hear the word of God right now these people they won't
2:07:41
understand they won't understand oh wow they're touched by the Holy Spirit right now
2:07:49
you know we have to have that wisdom and self-control to be thinking what is the best way I
2:07:56
can have compassion for people what is the best way I can shine my light and be
2:08:01
attractive to them so that they will want to hear what I'm saying about Jesus so that they will want to come to to the
2:08:08
church to come into this revival and when you have that as your motive as
2:08:14
your intention in your heart the Holy Spirit will lead you
2:08:21
when you carry that in your heart the fruits of the Holy Spirit that I must have which includes self-control the Holy Spirit will lead you
2:08:29
amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
2:08:38
thank you Jesus so um
2:08:47
in this new phase of revival where God is calling you to get out there more than ever God wants you to have this
2:08:53
equipping to shine your light in the most effective way because the harvest
2:08:59
is so ripe and he wants to win all of those souls from all these different backgrounds some people don't have never
2:09:06
heard of Jesus some people have heard of Jesus their whole lives and are turned off by religion some people are in
2:09:13
church currently but don't know of God's power have never encountered God's power they're oppressed with demons so when
2:09:20
you go out into the world and you shine your light you have to be aware of all
2:09:26
these different people with all these different backgrounds and carry that intention in your heart with every
2:09:31
person how can I lead them to you Jesus and as
2:09:36
you do that the Holy Spirit will give you the words he will give you the wisdom of what to do of what to say of
2:09:43
how to shine your light amen hallelujah
2:09:49
hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus praise
2:09:54
God praise God thank you Lord
2:10:01
you know as a Samaritan woman at the well went around and shared her testimony with everybody that's what
2:10:07
brought in the harvest the Bible says that many came to Jesus because of the woman's testimony
2:10:13
many people came and God is ready to increase his revival he's ready to
2:10:19
increase this church but the way it's going to happen is not from God speaking from heaven is not
2:10:26
from God giving people dreams for the most part come to 5F Church come to
2:10:31
revival but how God is going to enlarge his revival in this church is by doing
2:10:39
what he did through the Samaritan woman at the well many people many more people
2:10:44
thousands millions more came into this revival thousands
2:10:50
more came to 5F Church where we had to get a bigger venue for church services
2:10:57
because of the woman and the man's testimony
2:11:02
because of this woman you because of this man you because of this man you
2:11:08
because of this woman you because of this man because of this woman man you you you you you you you you you You
2:11:16

2:11:22
because of all of you because of you
2:11:28
many came to Jesus because of you
2:11:36
not because of me up here because of you sheep produce sheep
2:11:45
that's how the revival grows if you will go out and spread the good news that is being preached that is being released
2:11:52
that's how more people will come into the kingdom amen
2:11:57
jesus moving through you yes I have a part to play but how it will grow how
2:12:03
the revival grows from here is up to you to get people to the good news that's
2:12:10
being released to get people to the anointing that's being released
2:12:16
are you ready to go out there and be like the Samaritan woman at the well and
2:12:22
share this good news are you ready hallelujah god's ready to use you so
2:12:29

2:14:05
more that God has planned we still need funds for both of them so I encourage
2:14:11
you to give to give generously so that there is no lack and so that we can keep
2:14:16
doing more events that God has called us to do paris and New Zealand are two places
2:14:23
that the Holy Spirit is leading us to have events right now they aren't planned yet because we need the funds so
2:14:31
you can go to fivefchurch.org/give /give and there's on the main giving page there's different funds for events you
2:14:37
can give to specifically but I just want to encourage you and remind you the importance of your sewing the importance
2:14:44
of your continual sewing and generosity because it translates to more kingdom
2:14:50
work being done it translates to more events where people are healed and delivered and encounter God's power like
2:14:57
we saw happen in Portland hallelujah so this is a great responsibility God
2:15:03
has called you to and it's an honor amen to literally be the vessels of God that
2:15:10
lead to people coming into the kingdom and being set free amen
2:15:16
hallelujah and as you give generously God sees your seeds and he brings a
2:15:21
reaping in your life every time you can never outgive God he will always give
2:15:28
back more than what you gave spiritual blessings and also in physical ways like
2:15:33
physical needs that you have financial needs it comes from you giving from you being
2:15:39
generous when you sow you will reap the Bible says those who sow sparingly reap
2:15:44
sparingly those who sow generously reap generously this is a principle in the kingdom of God so I encourage you all to
2:15:52
sew generously to please God to do what you were called to do on this earth to
2:15:58
contribute to God's work and so that you may receive more that God has for you
