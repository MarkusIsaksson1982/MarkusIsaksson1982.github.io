57:17
Church can I see your hands hallelujah Welcome
57:24

57:31
are so blessed to have you here I'm so excited for what God is going to do today Um it's going to be a day of
57:39
celebration We have so much to celebrate God really brought the greatest
57:46
celebration ever for the day where we honor and celebrate his resurrection
57:51
with bringing this Arise and Shine conference the two days before the week of Easter weekend Amen So we've been
57:58
celebrating and today is the ultimate celebration for what he has done these past couple days and the celebration of
58:05
his love and power and victory in our life Are you ready to celebrate
58:10
today hallelujah Hallelujah Praise God Um well I also
58:17
want to welcome everyone watching tuning in for the first time Everyone watching share this with your friends and family
58:23
God is going to move through the screen in power I believe that it it's going to
58:28
be a greater glory today God is a God who takes us glory to glory We go higher
58:34
and higher Faith upon faith glory upon glory power upon power
58:39
The more faith the more God can do And I remember I remember last year's Flourish
58:45
Conference a year exactly a year ago from now and what God did at the
58:51
Flourish Conference infused so much faith in people that they didn't have
58:56
before And it was this crescendo of faith that led to God doing miracles
59:03
that were so shocking the the most shocking on at Sunday service that
59:09
weekend And so I believe God is going to do the same thing today where this this
59:15
increase of faith this increase of surrender this increase of hunger and
59:21
fire for God to receive all he has for us has come to all of you And so I
59:29
believe with all of my heart that God is going to do miracles that many of you have dreamed for prayed for for many
59:36
years I believe we're going to see God do new miracles today we've never seen before I believe we're going to see
59:42
people healed of all kinds of diseases The lame will walk I believe
59:48
blind eyes will open I believe deaf ears will open I believe resurrection life
59:53
will come If there is anyone that needs to be risen from the dead through the screen I
59:59
believe he's going to raise you from the dead through the screen and even in the future if someone dies
1:00:05
that they would play this live stream of today and be risen from the dead because God's power is
1:00:12
here and the recipe for miracles is God's power and
1:00:19
faith and that is here so powerfully today
1:00:25
Amen Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah
1:00:30
[Applause] Hallelujah Thank you Jesus Today is the
1:00:36
day Today is the day God will be glorified like never before I believe
1:00:42
it'll be a greater glory like we've never seen today Hallelujah
1:00:48
Hallelujah Praise God Well as we celebrate what Jesus has
1:00:55
done and give him glory I'm we're going to have a few people share some testimonies sharing testimonies of what

thought that that was make my parents uh sad and there was some other problem So

uh here I can express my emotions again So praise the Lord Yes
1:03:09

1:03:15
for the Spanish people and I was on downstairs and you started praying for the team for me and for the rest of the
1:03:22

1:04:06
My name is Barbara I'm from Germany I'm a pastor in Germany And I had a like a
1:04:13
burnout 2023 in February I took a time alone with the Lord And in that time
1:04:20
alone with him in my closet I found you and have been praying to see the power
1:04:28
of God for so many years They said "Lord finally I find what I was looking
1:04:34
for." And I came home and I took my husband and I told him what I found and
1:04:40
we came to Prague and the Lord broke off of me This whole um down feeling like
1:04:46
depression and like burnout feeling I came home with new
1:04:52
fire and I I said in our church we are just small
1:04:58
but we need this fire I shared your video just a short clip and persecution
1:05:04
started to erupt in our church They said um they don't believe that this is real
1:05:10
They have seen these videos that were made about you They said that's not good That's from the devil and then I'm from
1:05:17
the devil because I'm under you So I had a really hard time in my own church and
1:05:24
the people that were criticizing that they left the church So we had a split in the church and my husband who's
1:05:31
pastoring with me he said "Please stop watching Please stop sharing We will have a big problem if you continue." So
1:05:39
I had a choice to make and I said "Lord I found what I've been looking for."
1:05:55
So I continue to watch I continue to watch but secretly I got planted in
1:06:03
September last year secretly and I got enrolled in the E course secretly and
1:06:09
then Arise and Shine came up I said "Lord I want to go but I can't because we have this situation at home." And I
1:06:16
had been sick with the flu for three weeks So I felt weak I felt like under a
1:06:22
clock of fear and intimidation but I wanted to come So the
1:06:29
Lord said "Share your testimony." I shared my testimony With sharing my testimony the heavens broke open
1:06:47
because in the comments many people commented One of them was Laura from Germany
1:06:53
and I knew her from her testimony So the testimony was the way for me to come and
1:07:00
I said Laura I would love to come but I have no no money I am sick and I am
1:07:06
under this situation And she said "You have to come." I said "I will come." So I said "Lord you have to make
1:07:13
a way." He provided for the finances He provided for the flight He provided for accommodation And he opened my husband's
1:07:21
heart to allow me to come with his [Applause]
1:07:28
blessing So I'm here and he has blessed me also to come and he is not uh angry
1:07:35
that I'm here And then we two days ago we were waiting in the line for two hours to come in and I start to feel
1:07:42
sick again And then I start to say yesterday get behind me Satan I just
1:07:47
learned that And in the session yesterday I got
1:07:54
completely healed Yes Yes And this fear has broken from me
1:08:01
The fear of men or fear of persecution as you taught us
1:08:09
Amen I want to thank you so much that I can be planted under you and I can
1:08:15
receive from you and I will continue to share what the Lord has done
1:08:21
Amen Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah Thank you Come here Come

1:10:08
hi hun Thank you for sharing Come on Come on in here So I know some people have heard your testimony but not
1:10:14
everyone Prior to Arise and Shine what God did Do you want to share and then you can share what God did at Arise and
1:10:21
Shine yeah Um so for a long time since I was like 12 to eight I suffered with um
1:10:30
depression and always wanting to kill myself or kill other people And I've
1:10:36
never loved people at all I've always had like a hatred and if someone were to
1:10:43
like make me mad or I were to stub my toe on something immediately like
1:10:48
demonic thoughts would come in my head and it would be like oh kill them gut
1:10:53
them out and like um kill myself or jump out of the window and I would always um
1:11:00
go into the room I would either cut myself or bang my head and it would my
1:11:06
head would be like so swollen and I was like I was 145 lbs but
1:11:13
my head like looked like I was like 200 lb cuz I would always like bang it and
1:11:19
hit it on like the door like go in the bathroom and punch myself And I just
1:11:25
like was never free And then one day my mom she saw like a Spanish video not
1:11:30
even an English video of Apostle in her room And I saw like a shift in my mom
1:11:36
and I wanted what I wanted what my mom had and she had shared her testimony and
1:11:42
I had went up to her room after and she finally showed me what it was and I
1:11:48
threw away all my collections like that were worth like hundreds to thousands of dollars of like BTS of um things I
1:11:56
idolized more than God cuz for a young age I just never believed in God even though I was Pentecostal soul Um I saw
1:12:04
people touched by the power of God but never how I saw at your church And so
1:12:10
when I had got free of that we had finally decided to come cuz we didn't know you were in LA We thought you were
1:12:16
in like New York or something And then um when we found that out we wanted to come and my sister was the first one to
1:12:23
get prayed for And after that I had finally been delivered of everything I
1:12:30
haven't suffered from demonic depression at
1:12:35
all And yeah so all the thoughts went away
1:12:43
and I I have never like thought about hurting someone else I haven't And there
1:12:50
would be like spurges of anger but with your teachings I just like reject them and like they like they go They had to
1:12:57
go So they're not coming [Applause] back and there your teachings your
1:13:05
teachings were very easy for me to catch on to So even when I was 16 and I came I
1:13:12
understood very quick and my little sister did too She was nine and we
1:13:17
immediately knew to reject like the evil thoughts So when we went to um we had
1:13:23
went to flourish and these like I had were I was suffering of more demonic
1:13:29
oppression at that time of um evil names that I didn't know about like um like
1:13:36
ball or all I didn't know who that was at all and it they were just coming I couldn't sleep My mom was having like
1:13:43
sing to me at Flourish I was delivered of that I never thought about it And
1:13:49
then at this time at a rise and shine conference I was so expectant And this
1:13:55
week I was like hoing the garden um cuz it was like very big And I hurt my
1:14:02
should my collar bone and I had went to go pay for my mom to get nails done And
1:14:08
you know how they have massage chairs it I was like crying out in pain like when the massage chairs were like touching it
1:14:15
touching my back I had a rise and shine when you said at
1:14:20
the last session "Grab your miracle." I grabbed it and I couldn't move my
1:14:27
shoulder I knew and yeah I
1:14:33
just now I could like it doesn't hurt anymore And I want this for my whole
1:14:40
school I want this for my friends Yeah
1:14:48
Hallelujah Hallelujah Come here hun Praise God You
1:14:55

1:15:01
17 God is sending you out into your school to be a bright light To be the
1:15:06
reason that people come to Jesus and are saved and are free And just like you saw
1:15:12
your mom and you wanted what she had that's already happening in your school and it's going to increase from now And
1:15:19
I call your schoolmates the people in school to be attracted to you and ask you questions and find Jesus through you
1:15:27

"Grab your miracle I am speaking these miracles I'm about to speak them now Grab it." And she grabbed it You can
1:16:09

rare In 2006 I decide to move to United States Um I was living in a small town
1:22:34
very poor town where I grew up with my parents and I always want since I was a
1:22:40
kid I wanted to help my parents So I moved to United States and then um same
1:22:46
year my my older brother he started drinking alcohol very bad
1:22:52
So somebody told my my mom that there were some spiritual doctors that they
1:22:58
will help my brother So I told my mom yes we want to help him And then uh
1:23:04
there were u workers from the devil witches So I
1:23:11
started sending thousands of dollars thousands of dollars for them And my
1:23:17
brother brother was getting worse He couldn't stay in some jobs He was
1:23:22
getting fired And then uh he came to United States in
1:23:28
2008 And then I noticed something that on when he was on the way here I broke
1:23:34
my ankle It it I've been going through like a lot of things So
1:23:39
um and then uh in 2016 or 18 I think I started following a
1:23:47
pastor that he is in Houston He's the one who invited you to revival is now
1:23:53
Houston His name is uh Hermia Maldonado Jeremiah Maldonado Um he prophesied something
1:24:00
over my country and then I started follow him just curious if the prophecy will come through
1:24:07
Um and then in 2022 um my son was um diagnosed with
1:24:16
autism So in that year I I was depressed I was with so much anxiety suicidal
1:24:24
thoughts and then I I told God what happened what you know what I'm
1:24:31

1:24:49

1:25:35
depressed I got I was desperate for money And then I started watching some videos on YouTube from a guy that's from
1:25:42
Spain He's a satanic cult leader So I was talking with him I was texting and
1:25:49
then he was telling me what to do so I can come in the ordinary and then I was
1:25:55
doing rituals with the money and then um I bought a book on Amazon from him and
1:26:00
just it it was a it was kind of rare because just repeating things repeating things and doing little rituals on on
1:26:07
the mirror things like that So and then in in the beginning of 20 23 I I I told
1:26:15
my my girlfriend uh my future uh wife we're going to get married in like three
1:26:21
weeks Um I told her you know we're going to start a business and and she's like
1:26:28
"Yes." And I started spending all the money all the money that we had um her money my son's savings all I spent all
1:26:36
the money And I didn't know that was demonic So when I realized that I was demonp possessed
1:26:44
um I knew that I went very very deep in
1:26:49
demonic things So yeah So I went to four different churches in Maryland looking
1:26:56
for deliverance And then the day that I I decide to to break the curse I grab
1:27:04
the the yearly the everything that they send me I put in a
1:27:09
dumpster So I went to different churches and then nothing But uh but and then at
1:27:17
the same time I was watching the videos from this pastor in Houston live on Facebook And then is when one day he I
1:27:25
was trying to talk to him I was trying to go to his church I knew that he he's
1:27:30
he's used by God powerfully to thank God And then one day he posted your picture
1:27:35
saying revival is now Houston And that's how I came across with you And then um I
1:27:42
remember that day I remember that day And then um I still was trying to talk to him and and I make phone calls send
1:27:48
emails nothing So I was like "Okay I'm going through this ministry." And then um I found you on Facebook and sadly the
1:27:57
first persons that I found was scammers So they were like saw a seed here We can
1:28:05
see prophetic that things like that was like this going to be it But finally I
1:28:10
found the the email and I sent the email and then 4 days later I got respond and
1:28:16
then uh it was July July 2023 that when
1:28:22

1:28:58

1:29:04

1:29:10
remote on on my hand and he was like "Hallelujah Hallelujah." Pointing the TV because he hurts when I
1:29:18
say allelujah When you say allelujah he heard that Hey Yeah And then um on
1:29:25
Friday when I when I was landing to the airport the the the plane was landing on

1:31:05
delivered you powerfully I'm so blessed to be here I'm so blessed to be here Apostle I've been
1:31:11
watching for only a couple of months and he has changed my life so much
1:31:19
This is the first time being here in LA This is the first time being in this church Wow I just need to breathe
1:31:28
Wow So I'm going to let tell a little bit about my life Um because my life has
1:31:35
been very much I think demonic spiritually bonds from the beginning
1:31:41
actually from when I was a kid because my father had a mental illness uh that
1:31:46
made him go into psychosis which made him go into another kind of reality So I
1:31:53
he he he went into these stages and I remember just being very afraid of him
1:31:59
like very afraid of him all the time And when he was in this psychosis he could
1:32:04
say that he was Jesus He said that he could fly He said that he could go
1:32:09
through walls It was very scary And I witnessed
1:32:14
I my mother didn't left him My mother didn't leave him So I was in that house
1:32:20
for many years from I was when I was born He wanted to throw himself out the
1:32:26
window because he thought he could fly because he thought he was Jesus or
1:32:31
something And I was just a newborn baby So and I I feel like I feel like my
1:32:38
mother just stayed there with him uh to protect the family or something
1:32:44
So in my life I had struggled from from my whole life with anxiety with thoughts
1:32:50
of death like you should kill yourself You're ugly You're not worthy It's the
1:32:55
enemy I know now but I didn't know then I just learned that now So I'm so
1:33:07
grateful I know that it's not me I know that it's not Jesus It's not God I know
1:33:13
that I'm God's I know that I belong to Jesus I know that my heart belongs to him So
1:33:20
now I can now I can tell these thoughts because I've had them for 20 years right i'm tw I'm 35 now and I've had them all
1:33:27
my life You're ugly You're worthless Paranoid thoughts that people hate me when I go into a room right
1:33:37
uh we love you Raise your hand Stand up if you love her
1:33:45
Stand
1:33:52
up We love you and we are your family We
1:33:57
are your family and and you are beautiful inside and outside And that's what we think
1:34:03
about you We think you are perfectly and beautifully made
1:34:11
And uh and then my life just kept going like very confused right because I had
1:34:16
influences from the enemy constantly in my mind and in my body So I did very
1:34:21
strange things I put myself in um dangerous situations with men for
1:34:27
example So I got raped and I have had sexual abuse and in my life So and I was
1:34:36
okay So when I was 20 I was walking I was feeling it so bad like when I like I
1:34:43
always did And then I heard a voice that was with I was walking on the field So
1:34:49
and it was actually a church nearby and I heard a voice that was inside of me and outside of me that said that I am
1:34:56
not alone And I knew that it was God [Applause]
1:35:07
Yes So okay Sorry I'm talking too long So h I I found this church a couple of
1:35:13
months ago and I started to listen to your teachings and I my eyes opened up
1:35:19
to that there is the spiritual realm and I got so much wisdom and I couldn't stop listening to your
1:35:26
videos I couldn't stop and I can't stop I just want to learn right
1:35:33
because I know that I've been I've been confused and I just want to learn like give me knowledge I just want to learn
1:35:40
So and then I want to apply the knowledge So so I can help other people right
1:35:46
and so it's so helpful this that you do with your online teachings So I have
1:35:51
been listening since February and I have learned so much like I cannot describe
1:35:57
And then yesterday when or I I think it was two days ago you called me up on stage and I couldn't see anything I
1:36:04
couldn't see your face I couldn't hear what you were saying I just felt the power knocking me back and I knew that
1:36:09
it was Jesus I knew that he was healing me And then I came back to my hotel in the
1:36:16
night and the enemy was just like you're not free You nothing happened He was
1:36:21
there again And I knew that this is not from God and I I can apply the teachings
1:36:27
that I've learned Right so it was really like what
1:36:34
happened yesterday uh or two days ago It was really like I know that God touched
1:36:39
me and he really opened my eyes to now you have to work like now it's starting right like now you have to apply what
1:36:46
you have learned Yes Amen Right Praise God Praise God Hallelujah

1:43:40
come here because if I come here it could get more swollen and they told me
1:43:46
to take a medicine but I didn't take the medicine I had faith that if I come to a
1:43:52
rise and shine it's going to get healed

Hi I I'm Kirsty Um I'm from or I'm originally from the Marshall Islands but
1:51:29
um I'm located at Iowa Debuke Iowa Um my testimony is um I had a dream It was
1:51:35
this was last year Um I had a dream where um I was in a like a decent
1:51:41
gathering It was like a royalty gathering For some reason I was in a table full of uh people with decent
1:51:46
titles And the chair that I was sitting in it was like I knew the men before me
1:51:51
were great warriors great men So I sat on the chair and across me was a man the humblest man I ever you know talked to
1:51:58
in a dream And he said to me "What do you want to be?" And I said "Warrior." And upon coming upon uh before becoming
1:52:05
uh um God one of God's cho soldiers I actually found my mom Amy Watuk If you
1:52:13
guys didn't know she's a she's the princess of the islands She dropped her title to become God's soldier
1:52:28
She such a humble humble person because how could she have like she's a princess
1:52:33
but she dropped her title just to do God's will and you know
1:52:38
um after having that dream I didn't know what it meant but I came across her and the group that she held was called
1:52:45
Warriors and it's still called Warriors the little the little warriors of God and She actually introduced me Well I
1:52:52
actually saw you years ago your videos years ago on YouTube And I was like still skeptical Like even years after I
1:52:58
was still skeptical as she introduced you to me I was like she was interested I was like cuz I was full of old wine or
1:53:05
religious ways Like I was born and raised through Catholic So um I've been to like different churches different
1:53:11
ministry one ministry and probably four churches And I was like uh a few months
1:53:17
back I was still complaining in my heart I was like "Lord why'd you bring me all the way through all these churches?"
1:53:24
Because now I'm literally like skeptical about you And then this was in Dallas
1:53:29
This was in Dallas I was in Dallas in the front And then you know like the
1:53:35
instrumental where you were uh imparting the anointing to everyone I was still like my heart was still hardening at
1:53:41
that time But I wanted to s surrender but for some reason I couldn't because I was too skeptical I was
1:53:47
like and then uh sorry and uh before coming here I was
1:53:54
like my mom would you know encourage me seek God out seek God out leave those
1:54:00
chores out leave everything out and you know empty yourself out before you go
1:54:06
before you go to receive more And I was like okay Lord but I was still you know with the anxiety that you declared over
1:54:13
me Praise God After you declared those yolks out of me I felt light Light I
1:54:20
couldn't felt this in any ministries or churches I felt just completely light
1:54:25
and peace And um sorry I'm trying to rewind to where I stopped at Uh so
1:54:32
Dallas yes After Dallas I was like "Oh empty yourself out." I I really saw God
1:54:37
like I was like "Lord please empty me out." I was still doing chores like in the kitchen doing chores but I was like
1:54:42
"Lord don't stop emptying me out Don't stop having me draw close to you." And
1:54:49
uh coming here actually on the 18th that you that's when I came up came up to the
1:54:55
stage at the other theater Um I was surrendered I was like in the in the
1:55:02
crowds I don't know who helped my hands to bring me to the front but that hand
1:55:08
as I surrendered I don't know who that humble man was or young man was but the
1:55:13
the way he held my hands I could I could already feel God's love I was like what is this wow I was like what a hopefully
1:55:21
I was in the crowd like I'm so small I'm regian by the way So micronians not all of them are short but most of them are
1:55:28
short of course Um but um but the way he held my hand and you said bring her
1:55:34
bring her up here as you declared all those stuff out of me They went out and then peace light hovered over me I
1:55:42
couldn't I I had to stop crying because it was out So

1:56:19
there was a scroll and the scroll represents the Bible God's word And I

seat Praise Jesus Wow Hallelujah I'm so in awe of what he
1:58:07
has done at Arise and Shine Thank you Jesus
1:58:15
Praise God Hallelujah Matthew 28:1 Early on Sunday
1:58:21
morning as the new day was dawning Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went out to visit the tomb Suddenly there was a
1:58:26
great earthquake for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven rolled aside the stone and sat on it The guard shook
1:58:33
with fear when they saw him and they fell into a dead faint Then the angel spoke to the women "Don't be afraid," he
1:58:39
said "I know you are looking for Jesus who is crucified He isn't here He is risen from the dead."
1:58:46
[Applause] Hallelujah He isn't here He has risen from the dead just as he said would
1:58:53
happen Come see where his body was lying And now go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the
1:58:59
dead and he is going ahead of you to Galilee You will see him there Remember what I have told you He is risen Amen
1:59:08
Hallelujah Hallelujah And it's so prophetic that the Arise and Shine
1:59:13
conference was the weekend of the when we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus
1:59:19
He has risen and now he's calling us to rise with him He is r He has risen and
1:59:27
he is rising in his revival right now And he's calling us to rise with him
1:59:33
because he chooses to use us So he is calling all of you to rise with him and
1:59:40
shine his light never before
1:59:45
Amen Now in this revival God is getting ready to shine like never before To show
1:59:52
himself to prove himself to open up eyes and to move in mighty signs and wonders
1:59:59
and miracles all over the world like we have never seen It's the year of
2:00:05
acceptance everybody Hallelujah I was sharing with my
2:00:12
spiritual father Prophet Joe Davyy um yesterday Um well actually before I
2:00:17
share this I want to say first of all if you didn't hear this actually you didn't hear this Many of you watching online
2:00:22
haven't heard this So I'm going to repeat something that God revealed to me so powerfully Um yesterday God had
2:00:30
spoken that at a rise and shine there was going to be a splitting of the sea that he was doing He was going to split
2:00:37
the sea for this move of God for 5F church Um and what the meaning of that
2:00:45
of course is is is showing a great wonder Hallelujah but also making a
2:00:51
way opening the door to to to to go past the enemies chasing after
2:00:59
us to go forward to overcome to escape the enemies to escape the enemy's traps
2:01:06
Amen Hallelujah And so in the past like month and a half or so the enemy has
2:01:14
really gotten angry as soon as certain doors were opened up for this move of God for this revival for this message of
2:01:21
freedom and his power and revival to get out to the world in new places The enemy
2:01:27
was angry Enemy started using people to speak lies to speak false accusations to bring persecution to try to hinder or
2:01:35
stop this move of God But the devil is always defeated He is always under our
2:01:40
feet And Jesus always has the victory And nothing can stop the work of God
2:01:48
Amen Nothing can stop the work of God
2:01:53
Nothing can stop God's plans Nothing can stop his revival Nothing can stop our
2:02:00
Jesus And when we stand with Jesus that means that we are on the winning team And that
2:02:06
means that we cannot be stopped either
2:02:13
Hallelujah Hallelujah Because God is with us And greater is he who is in us than he who is in the world trying to
2:02:20
come against us Amen And so um you know the scheme of the
2:02:27
enemy with persecution what he did in the times of Jesus what he did with all the prophets and apostles the scheme is
2:02:34
to try to get people to not accept the message accept the gospel message accept
2:02:41
the new wine Is to try to hinder people from coming and receiving Is to try to hinder people
2:02:48
from coming and entering into the kingdom of heaven is to try to keep people from receiving the keys of the
2:02:53
kingdom of heaven that unlock their freedom and their healing and abundant life and
2:02:59
salvation That is the enemy's scheme And so the so he tries to hold back people He tries to blind people from seeing the
2:03:07
light and coming and being a part and receiving and in turn being powerful
2:03:13
vessels of God being part of the army of God That's what the enemy tries So what so how so how he tries to accomplish
2:03:20
this the enemy is by sending lies is by sending false accusations is by bringing fear and intimid trying to bring fear
2:03:27
and intimidation don't go there don't go and receive there don't be a part of that
2:03:33
that's what the enemy tries to do um and so that is what the enemy we are seeing
2:03:38
the enemy try to do that as he always does he he's constantly trying to do this people are constantly trying to do
2:03:43
this for any work of God and any anointed servant of God there is always it's like it's constant It's it's just
2:03:50
life when you are anointed but it's a life of constant victory
2:03:56
We are warriors of God We are not spectators We're not citizens but we are in the we are enlisted in the army of
2:04:02
God And so we have a job to do every day Warriors every day but having victory
2:04:08
and conquering every single day Hallelujah So um so so so a meaning of the
2:04:16
splitting of the sea is really God showing himself God opening up eyes God
2:04:23
revealing that it is him It is him in his revival His re this
2:04:29
revival is God's move the power of God that is seen so
2:04:34
mightily so wildly like we've seen today already that it's really Jesus
2:04:43
God is proving this God is showing up and showing himself this The testimonies
2:04:49
that are heard the freedom the healing he is showing he is proving that this is
2:04:54
really him Amen And so
2:05:01
um when Thomas and his wife I don't know if they're here today but when Thomas and his wife from Illinois they're aged
2:05:07
75 and 77 during the uh Q&A session the very
2:05:13
first session he was the last person to ask a question He asked the question He said first of all he said I want to say
2:05:19
something I have waited 75 years for this
2:05:24
for revival And he said "My wife has been waiting longer 77 years she has waited for
2:05:32
this." They have prayed and waited for revival and it is here And he said it
2:05:38
with such gratitude and passion and awe of God And he then said,"I want to know
2:05:45
at my age how can I better be something like how can I be a better vessel of God to lead others to lead younger people
2:05:52
and and of all ages?" Um and so then as
2:05:59
he spoke that all of a sudden the Lord gave me this
2:06:05
this word The moment he said this he revealed this to me This is the
2:06:11
splitting of the sea moment right now Well like at a rise and shine it has
2:06:17
happened The Lord revealed something He revealed to me in this moment that first of all he revealed to
2:06:24
me just as he stands here and proclaims this and testifies this gentleman and
2:06:30
his wife just as they stand in God's army just stand there just show up and
2:06:37
take your place in God's revival army Something so powerful is taking
2:06:46
place And this isn't just the two of them It's it was everyone who has come Everyone who has come to this conference
2:06:53
Everyone who has come rising up taking their place in God's revival army full
2:06:58
of fire like supernaturally like like angels like an
2:07:03
angel army how they are supernatural filled with heaven angels
2:07:09
are right and so just as you all stand with the fire of the Holy Spirit
2:07:16
it's like you're angels almost you know it's like heaven on earth you're full of the you're not just people uh a group a
2:07:23
club an organization like you carry the fire of the Holy Spirit and you are a
2:07:30
true warrior of God and heaven is seen in you And we are an army together We
2:07:39
are God's army He's filled us on fire for a purpose to be in his army Not to
2:07:46
be just an individual flame doing its own thing But he's filled you with fire to be like an
2:07:53
angel in the army to be in his army of God on this earth to shine his light to
2:07:59
attract people to him But your role is a warrior in God's army
2:08:05
collectively with your brothers and sisters in Christ Amen
2:08:12
And so the Lord revealed this to me all of a
2:08:17
sudden right in this moment He revealed to me how first of all I want to share
2:08:23
this scripture 2 Kings 6:15 The servant of the man of God got
2:08:29
up early and went out And behold there was an army with horses and chariots encircling the city Elisha's servant
2:08:35
said to him "Oh no my master what are we to do?" Elisha answered "Do not be afraid for those who are with us are
2:08:42
more than those who are with them." Then Elisha prayed and said "Lord please open
2:08:49
his eyes that he may see." And the Lord opened the servant's eyes and he saw and
2:08:54
behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire surrounding Elisha
2:09:01
So it was filled with an angelic army full of
2:09:06
fire And this army of God was so much bigger and more powerful than the army
2:09:12
that that that the servant of Elisha was afraid of that seemed bigger than the physical army of Elisha Hallelujah
2:09:20
And so um Elisha's servant was like afraid Like you could tell in this
2:09:26
moment he's afraid And he's not boldly standing beside Elisha um with faith and
2:09:32
confidence And he's not standing as a warrior He's not standing full of fire in this moment before his eyes are
2:09:38
opening up He's like a bystander trying to figure out if he should run away and hide or what to do you know and his eyes
2:09:47
had to open up God opened his eyes and then he could see the truth He could see
2:09:54
the spiritual reality He could see the lies of the devil that they were really
2:09:59
lies That this was God's army And there was a whole angelic army backing up
2:10:06
God's army backing up Elisha and those with Elisha doing the work of God Amen
2:10:14
And so the Lord revealed to me that you know there are so many people who are
2:10:20
watching this revival who are watching this move of God There are millions
2:10:25
watching There are millions watching like the servant of Elisha Not standing with the move of God
2:10:32
but watching And and and the enemy is coming with lies like look the army against
2:10:40
them is greater The the enemy comes with confusion with lies trying to deceive
2:10:47
trying to keep these people away from the revival trying to keep them away
2:10:52
from fulfilling their purpose to be warriors in God's revival army There are
2:10:57
millions of people like that out there who are watching and and these people watching become
2:11:04
even more confused and unsure when the enemy rises up with his army in that
2:11:12
strategic season like that certain season where Elisha's servant is saying oh
2:11:19
no it wasn't every day there was a certain time there's a certain time when that army came against tried to come
2:11:25
against Elisha's army right and so what
2:11:31
God revealed to me in this moment was that he was opening up eyes over of many
2:11:39
believers and non-believers but many people all over the world who have been watching the move of God who have been
2:11:46
watching the revival but they've been hearing so much of the enemy's lies
2:11:51
They've been confused They've been deceived They've been unsure They've been afraid of persecution They've been
2:11:59
afraid of the naysayers of the critics of the people who seem like scary like
2:12:05
Goliath but really they're defeated and they can never stop the work of God Amen
2:12:11
There's a lot of people like that out there And in this moment God is opening
2:12:19
up their eyes to see the army that has risen and stood with God
2:12:27
And so all of you people from all over the world from 52 nations and 41 states
2:12:34
they gathered together in one physical place to worship Jesus to receive from Jesus to be obedient to Jesus because he
2:12:41
had said "I'm calling you like I called you at the day I called my believers in the day of Pentecost I've called you for
2:12:47
a divine appointment I've called you to unite together to be in one accord to physically come and gather together for
2:12:53
me You have done that people from 52 nations and 41 states And I'm telling
2:12:58
you only God can do that That is so supernatural Hallelujah And it's like
2:13:04
it's like all of you carry the fire because you've chosen to be strong in the Lord because you've chosen to reject
2:13:10
the lie like this beautiful testimony from Germany Barbara that she shared
2:13:17
that is a reflection of all of
2:13:23
you that you've chosen to reject the devil's lies You've you've chosen the
2:13:28
way of surrender That's not it's not the easy way It's the narrow roadway It's the way
2:13:36
less traveled And you've chosen to reject the lies of the devil and you've
2:13:41
chosen to not care what people think You've chosen to die to your ego You've chosen to endure persecution for the
2:13:48
sake of Jesus And you've chosen to take your place in the revival army that God has called you to be a part of And in
2:13:56
turn God has filled you with supernatural fire God has filled you with the light
2:14:01
of the world God has filled you with the hope of Jesus Christ God has filled you
2:14:06
with his anointing that is so mighty and powerful that the world needs and that many don't have that many Christians
2:14:13
don't have He's filled you with a supernatural joy that you cannot
2:14:19
contain where you have to keep praising him and worshiping him because the fire is so great and God has become so real
2:14:27
and good to you Hallelujah Hallelujah And so I see like
2:14:33
in the I see like in the spiritual realm it's like it's like this army has been
2:14:38
out there kind of like angels are all out there but then there's a time where the angels got to stand They got to come
2:14:44
together behind Elisha as this this army comes and it's time for this army to be
2:14:49
seen And I see like like like like you're filled with the fire of the Holy
2:14:54
Spirit You're filled with revival And if anyone looks at you they see that it's supernatural They see that you're like
2:15:00
an angel You're not an angel but you know what I mean Like this symbolic pro that's like a prophetic uh symbol I'm
2:15:06
sharing with you They see you like heaven on earth They they they see
2:15:11
there's something different about you They see that it has to be Jesus They see that it's love like they've never
2:15:16
known They see that it's a joy that they don't have And this is a lot of believers I'm talking about A lot of
2:15:22
believers are going to see your fire and say "I want
2:15:27
that." and and and hallelujah
2:15:33
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
2:15:40
[Applause]
2:15:55
Hallelujah Hallelujah When I run now I got to carry my torch
2:16:05
It's prophetic cuz sometimes I'm running up the mountain like this Now I see it's the carrying the
2:16:13
torch [Applause] Hallelujah This is Christians too A lot
2:16:19
of Christians there in the world they're going to see your light and they're going to be like I want that How do I
2:16:26
find that and you tell them and they're gonna not care like where you found this
2:16:31
light You're going to tell them about the anointing You're going to tell them how you received it how you position
2:16:37
yourself where God's powers is it it where God's power is moving And they're not going to care what the naysayers
2:16:44
have to say about where you received it from because they're going to say "I want
2:16:49
that I want that That is Jesus All I know is that is
2:16:57
Jesus All I know is that is peace joy that is fire for God And I want that
2:17:05
It's fruits You're revealing fruits You're revealing something that's
2:17:10
beautiful that people see is real and good to taste and eat and they want it
2:17:16
for themselves There's no "Oh is that really God?" When you when you really will shine your
2:17:22
light it will be seen by Maybe not by the people that just want
2:17:28
to be in deceit because of evil in their hearts be but but by by by the many
2:17:33
believers in this world There's a lot of them with pure hearts out there And they will be able to see and they'll be able
2:17:39
to see it quicker when you will shine your brightest [Applause]
2:17:45
Hallelujah Hallelujah So okay So the Lord revealed
2:17:51
this to me that just this this this wonder this supernatural occurrence of
2:17:58
people from 52 nations and 41 states coming and not just coming but coming full of the most fire that I and I think
2:18:04
all of us have ever been a part of in our life Like the most heaven on earth we've ever experienced because it was
2:18:09
like 1,000 people from 52 nations and 41 states on fire for
2:18:17
Jesus What's normal what's normal in the church today is for it to be a minority
2:18:22
that's on fire A minority is in the front jumping up and praising God But this was
2:18:30
everybody You're looking like the angelic army You're looking so supernatural Heaven on earth And so God
2:18:38
said that this is the splitting of the sea moment that through this through simply the revival army taking their
2:18:45
place shining so bright revealing their fire and praising God with everything in
2:18:51
them It was going to be God was opening up eyes through this God was opening up eyes around the whole world to see this
2:18:59
is me He's revealing himself through you through the army We are arising We are
2:19:06
arising in this revival army and shining for the world to
2:19:14
see and and I was left in I was left in awe I and I couldn't stop repeating this
2:19:21
Many of you have heard this now like three times because it was so in my fire this what I just shared I mean it was so
2:19:28
in my heart as fire what I have just shared what God spoke to me in that moment at the Q&A session when Thomas
2:19:35
and his wife shared that their question their their question I want to be used
2:19:41
more powerfully in this move of God how and I got home and I shared first I
2:19:47
shared videos of the first day of all of you on fire I shared them with my spiritual father prophet Joe Davyy
2:19:54
I shared it with him and you know he he he actually said he said God is going to be splitting the sea he actually
2:20:00
prophesied that to me He's like "God is going to be splitting the sea at this rise and shine." Okay But he didn't say
2:20:06
other things He didn't speak other things So me I'm expecting a splitting of the sea But me I'm I know God's going
2:20:12
to surprise all us all me included with what that's going to look like with how he's going to do that And so my
2:20:19
spiritual father didn't say anything else in terms of details of like what specifically God would do how this sea
2:20:26
would be split And I was so in awe not surprised but fully
2:20:33
shocked when I listened to a voice message that a voice record audio record audio message that my spiritual father
2:20:40
Prophet Joe Davies sent me last night after he saw the videos and he said this
2:20:45
I'm not kidding He said this This is what God has
2:20:52
done Those people out there that didn't know that God was with 5F that didn't
2:20:57
know if this was really revival that were listening to the naysayers out there and were confused God is opening
2:21:04
up their eyes like how the servant like how the servant of Elisha's eyes were
2:21:09
opened up to see the angelic army He literally said
2:21:15
that He literally said that Hallelujah
2:21:21
[Applause] Hallelujah
2:21:26
Hallelujah Hallelujah So I want to share that amazing confirmation
2:21:34
from God from a true prophet a prophet of prophets in this world that spoke the
2:21:41
same exact thing that God revealed to me that day
2:21:48
Hallelujah Hallelujah
2:21:53
Hallelujah Hallelujah And so you know Elisha servant was now
2:22:00
he could now see and so now he would have been excited to join this beautiful
2:22:05
army of God He would have been so he would been running to join I want to be
2:22:11
a part of that I want to carry that heaven on earth like the angels are I want to be on the winning team I want to
2:22:18
have victory after victory with Jesus I want to be used powerfully by God like they are I want to be set on fire like

2:27:41
that you have seen Jesus in my eyes I declare that as my spiritual sons and
2:27:46
daughters you must have my DNA spiritually Jesus must be seen in your
2:27:54
eyes And I declare this upon all of you I release impartation upon your eyes now
2:28:02
that it would shine such light because this is where people look when you speak to them They look in your eyes Let light
2:28:10
come Let more light come in your eyes in Jesus' name Let people see Jesus in your
2:28:17
eyes Let them have a supernatural encounter with God as they look in your eyes as you speak to them and look at
2:28:24
them with love and compassion As you look at them as Jesus sees them may they
2:28:30
see Jesus looking at them with love and compassion [Music]
2:28:37
Hallelujah Your eyes will shine and your heart will thrill with
2:28:45
joy Woo your heart will thrill with joy If there
2:28:52
isn't a more if there isn't a more perfect sentence scripture to to to
2:28:58
capture in one sentence what God did this past weekend and today it's this
2:29:05
Your heart will thrill with joy
2:29:13
This is what happens when the light of Jesus shines upon you When you allow his
2:29:19
light to shine upon you as you come to him with purity and humility like a
2:29:25
child for merchants from around the world will come to you They will bring you the wealth of many
2:29:32
lands I told I was speaking yesterday for those of you that were at the conference that as you serve God this is
2:29:40
where you are blessed the most And all this is is is is unlocking the
2:29:46
surren the the abundant life that God has promised us Abundant life comes as
2:29:52
you surrender everything to God and become a true child of him And God
2:29:57
honors and blesses those who serve him And God's lifts for his glory those who
2:30:03
serve him Those who serve him with everything surrender everything He can
2:30:09
entrust with more They are the ones with humble hearts that he can lift and they won't steal his glory That he will lift
2:30:16
and they will keep giving him all the glory That he will lift and people will be attracted to Jesus instead of them as
2:30:23
a person And so the more you serve God the more he lifts you And the lifting
2:30:30
looks like lifting in every area It looks like just more favor be coming upon you People will just want to hire
2:30:37
you people will just want to come and and go to your business because they feel they feel joy when they come into
2:30:43
your shop or something Um it it it looks like people wanting to bless you because
2:30:48
you are such a blessing to them They they're just giving you they're giving you money They're just blessing you
2:30:54
because you've blessed them so much They they they bless you So this is how God
2:31:00
lifts you And all of this is for his glory to shine his light and to give and
2:31:05
bless to his kingdom to give more to his kingdom to bless others Amen And so this
2:31:12
will really happen as we arise and shine Wealth from spiritual to financial will
2:31:18
come upon you You will be God will cause doors to open up to be more to bless you
2:31:24
God will move in people's hearts to bless you God will do this
2:31:29
supernaturally himself The more people see Jesus in you
2:31:34
the more they want to bless you And I say bless you as completely for the purpose for God's kingdom Because
2:31:42
whoever God can trust the most he blesses the most in every area including financially
2:31:48
So when it comes to really serving God when money is really coming from God not the devil God blesses those who he can
2:31:56
trust And that's in his timing It doesn't mean that if you don't see if you if you're seeing not many finances
2:32:03
right now that he can't trust you No no no no He takes you through a lot of testing He takes you through ways to see
2:32:09
if he can trust you But he wants he needs his kingdom to advance from
2:32:14
spiritual to financial There there's going to come a time where Orium theater
2:32:19
is not big enough for the conference There's going to come a time
2:32:26
soon So soon there's going to come a time I prophesy that this theater is not
2:32:32
going to be big enough for our Sunday services There's going to come a time soon that
2:32:38
that we will need stad arenas and stadiums all the time for the events
2:32:43
[Applause] Hallelujah And so all of this costs more
2:32:50
money So God what God does is when he's ready to move more and their army is
2:32:55
rising up more he blesses the once he can trust more in the kingdom to give
2:33:01
more to his kingdom so he can do greater things and have bigger arenas to hold
2:33:06
all the people that he brings Amen
2:33:11
Hallelujah Matthew 5:14 you are the light of Christ to the
2:33:16
world A city set on a hill cannot be hidden Nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket put on a put but
2:33:23
on a lampstand and it gives light to all who are in the house Let your light shine before men in such a way that they
2:33:31
may see your good deeds and moral excellence and recognize and honor and
2:33:36
glorify your father who is in heaven So this is God's direction for
2:33:43
you after the conference This is God's direction for you for all of you that it
2:33:48
is time to put your to take any way that you've been hiding your light Any way
2:33:53
maybe it's through your giftings maybe it's through your words maybe it's through testifying maybe it's through
2:33:58
sharing on social media Any way that you have been hiding your light that God has
2:34:04
given you it's time to take that light from underneath the basket and put it on
2:34:11
the lampstand Put it up high for everyone to see It is time now to arise
2:34:19
and shine like never before As you as you go from here you need to make the
2:34:25
intention every day This is my calling from God This is my assignment This is
2:34:30
my commandment God is demanding this event that he's counting on me that I
2:34:35
lift my light up that I'm intentional to lift my light up and let everyone around
2:34:41
me see my light I must never withhold it I must never be afraid I must always
2:34:48
choose to be bold confident courageous and like a lion and lioness I will
2:34:55
boldly proclaim the truth and let my light shine
2:35:01
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
2:35:07
It's time to arise and shine
2:35:16
Hallelujah Keep this fire I also want to say Prophet Jordi he wanted me to share
2:35:22

2:36:19

2:36:27
babies into the kingdom We just shine and that we just share with them what God has done Amen
2:36:35
So stir that fire Keep that fire alive God is counting on you Hallelujah
2:36:41
[Applause] Hallelujah Praise God Praise God You can
2:36:47
have a seat now We are going to be taking communion right now
2:36:53
as a body of Christ as a family And I'm so excited for what God's going to do as
2:36:58
we take communion When when Jesus
2:37:13
says 1 Corinthians
2:37:19
11:23 for I pass unto you what I receive from the Lord himself
2:37:26
On the night when he was betrayed the Lord Jesus took some bread and gave thanks to God for it Then he broke it in
2:37:33
pieces and said "This is my body which is given for you Do this in remembrance of me." In the same way he took the cup
2:37:40
of wine after supper saying "The cup is the new covenant between God and his people in agreement confirmed with my
2:37:46
blood Do this in remembrance of me as often as you drink it For every time you
2:37:52
eat this bread and drink this cup you are announcing the Lord's death until he comes
2:37:58
again Hallelujah The revelation that God has released in
2:38:04
this new wine this new wine that he is is is bringing in this revival is that
2:38:11
communion should not be taken religiously and as a ritual and as a tradition that is done just repetitively
2:38:18
because there is so much power in communion There is so much power in it
2:38:23
in the taking of the communion There is so much power of it be power in it
2:38:28
because it is a symbol of intaking Jesus into our lives of intaking him is our
2:38:35
everything Nothing else but we intake Jesus We fill our lives with Jesus
2:38:42
Nothing else nothing else of this world We eat we fill we eat his word We fill
2:38:49
ourselves with his word When you read the Bible when you read the word when you eat the word which is the bread of
2:38:55
life when you eat it it nourishes you It opens up your eyes to his love It brings
2:39:00
heaven on earth It equips you Gives you victory over the enemy It fills you with God's
2:39:06
love It brings it brings it bring it leads to healing and freedom when you apply God's words When you eat God's
2:39:12
words my book Unlock Your Deliverance it's all based on the word of God It's all giving revelation of what is in the
2:39:20
word of God's directions of how to be free and healed So you receive heaven You receive
2:39:26
healing and freedom as you read the word The word is Jesus is God
2:39:34
So what we're doing right now when we we we eat the bread we drink the juice this
2:39:40
is this is a symbol of what we are doing in the spiritual realm of eating God
2:39:47
eating the word filling ourselves with God so that it he nourishes us and gives
2:39:52
us life and sustains us and gives us energy and strength
2:40:00
Hallelujah And when we drink his blood by his stripes we are healed His blood has removed our
2:40:08
sins His blood has healed us from our sicknesses from our iniquities from our
2:40:13
from the oppression of the enemy Has broken off the curses of our lives So
2:40:19
when we believe in the power of his blood and we intake his blood we receive
2:40:25
his blood in our lives we receive healing This is the action of faith that
2:40:32
I believe that you died for my sins and you also died You died You died to take
2:40:39
away my sins to bring me salvation and abundant life and a relationship with you But also you shed your blood By your
2:40:44
stripes we are healed You have shed your blood so that I could be healed today so that the works of the devil could be
2:40:50
destroyed off my life today So this is the action of faith It's not about
2:40:56
feelings It's not like I feel like God will heal me It's about intaking choose
2:41:02
to choosing to intake his blood into your life to bring
2:41:08
healing to bring freedom from condemnation from the past and sin To
2:41:14
bring freedom from all oppression The blood washes it away The blood is so
2:41:20
powerful that the demons have to flee Hallelujah So when we take communion so
2:41:26
this is a this is what we were doing always but when we take communion it's a special time to renew our minds and
2:41:33
activate our faith even more and honor what Jesus has done for us so that we
2:41:39
can receive more of what he has provided for us that we may be missing
2:41:45
It's a moment we put our eyes on the cross and and what he has done for us
2:41:52
and we we we renew our minds with the power of what he did on the cross The
2:41:57
power of the shedding of blood This lifts our faith This this
2:42:03
makes the faith to grow as we put our eyes there in this powerful moment of
2:42:10
remembrance so that miracles may take place that didn't happen before
2:42:15
because of of your faith being lifted by this action of obedience this action of
2:42:22
faith Amen And so a lot of people they take
2:42:27
communion um religiously and when you do something religiously it loses the
2:42:33
power Just like reading the Bible just like going to church when you do it religiously but not led by the Holy
2:42:40
Spirit the power is gone and it's replaced with activities and
2:42:46
traditions and rituals and entertainment and all other things but the power of
2:42:51
the Holy Spirit So the the Holy Spirit has released this
2:42:57
revelation in this revival in this new wine that when Jesus says when you when
2:43:02
you do this do this in remembrance of me in remembrance the prophetic meaning of
2:43:08
that is the opposite of religious ritual way but it's to do it not all the time
2:43:15
because then it becomes just going through the programs going through the program of doing it but to take a
2:43:23
special moment like how on Christmas and on Easter resurrection Sunday these are
2:43:30
one time a year we don't we don't spec it's is the reason why Easter and
2:43:35
resurrection Sunday is so special is so so special it's always so powerful and
2:43:42
special every year amen with Christmas but it's because it's not every day there's some things
2:43:48
where it's meant to be not always happening but once in a a while so that
2:43:54
there's more meaning and power to it Amen Hallelujah So this is why we are taking
2:44:02
communion today now because this is what the Holy Spirit has led in terms of the
2:44:07
the amount of times to do it in in terms of when to do it And because we are doing it led by the Holy Spirit there's
2:44:14
going to be many miracles that take place as we take communion and after
2:44:19
taking communion Bodies will be healed Demons will go Eyes will open up Ears
2:44:26
will open up in Jesus name Hallelujah
2:44:31
Thank you Jesus Thank you Jesus Jesus said take it and eat it for
2:44:39
this is my body So you can take and eat his bread right now
2:45:01
