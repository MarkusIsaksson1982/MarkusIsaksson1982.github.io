# Micro-Artworks – Markus Isaksson

A personal gallery of 12 single-file HTML5 + Canvas experiments,  
all generated 100% locally using Ollama (llama3.2) + Grok 4.1  
November–December 2025

Each piece is a tiny universe: fragile, poetic, and slightly haunted.  
They are not finished products — they are seeds.  
They are proof that even a few hundred lines of code, guided by local AI, can feel alive.

## Vision

These micro-projects are not meant to be "complete".  
They are invitations to wonder:  
- What if we gave them sound?  
- What if they remembered your actions forever?  
- What if they lived on a phone, in VR, or as generative NFTs?  
- What if they became the starting point for a real interactive art installation, a music visualizer, or a new kind of game?

They are my proof of concept that local AI can be a creative partner — not a replacement, but a spark.
