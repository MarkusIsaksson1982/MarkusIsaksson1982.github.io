welcome to the Revival is Now podcast I'm Apostle Katherine Crick and I am so
excited for my guest here today Jean Marshall welcome thank you for having me
mama oh I'm so excited to have you here and wow what a blessing you have been to
my life and I'm so grateful to God for you you are such an amazing woman of God
you were like my if I'm like David you were like my Jonathan jont tall has been
here at fifel church planted for six years and she has been such a
loyal servant uh with a c loyal loyal disciple
with a servant heart such a pure Precious Heart and I'm excited for you to get to know a little more about her
story so Jean tall it's been six years six years and I remember the day that
walked into fivefold church for the first time yeah at that time we were in a the basement of an American Legion in
Hollywood and I remember it was like an industrial kitchen you had to go through take an elevator down to get to this
theater and at that time I think there was like maybe 15 or so people at coming
to the church and two weeks before you came your mom
came for I think like the second time and when she when your mom was there
your parents were there I I had just received powerful impartation like never before from my spiritual father in
Tanzania East Africa and I came so expectant like never before for God to move in power and touch people and he
was faithful I remember just after the
message I called people forward to the altar your mom came forward I I touched her hand lightly and she fell back with
the power of God yeah and that was the first Time I Ever Saw God move in power through me and I I just see it as so
prophetic and beautiful of God that she was the first person to that I saw God
move in power through and then two weeks later you come she invites you and you
have been so significant in my life and at fivefold church so it's so just
beautiful the details of God and um yeah so I remember when you came and I just l
i it's I literally can remember seeing you for the first time and before church started welcoming you uh do you want to
share like your like what that experience was like when you first came yeah so like you said my mom invited me
and she told me she's like there's this little church you know you should check it out you know they pray for people at
the end um you should just go check it out because at that time I had been hopping from church to church a lot of
times not even going to church for like months at a time so I was really in a Wilderness season
and um she told me about the church and I was like okay sure like I was like so nonchalant and so about it like it was
just like okay and um when I think about it I just really laugh like how God must
be like I'm about to rock your world I'm about to change your whole entire life and you're just
like so I always think how he must be like laughing at that moment but um she
told me about it and it truly was the second best decision of my life of me
just saying yes and yeah I'll go check it out it was it was the second best
decision of my entire life and I came and yeah we were meeting in a basement
it was really small just like 15 people there and um yeah you had to go down
cross the kitchen and get into the room and I just remember you being the first
person to greet me and it really marked me it really touched my heart because at
that time I had never been seen by leadership in a church and that was fine I thought that was normal I thought that
was okay and you know like I didn't really think too much of it but when you
acknowledged me and you said hi it really just touched me so much like wow
like she sees me like I she can see me actually and so it really it really
touched me and um I didn't even know that God wanted to touch me in that way
like how he wanted to like heal like a wound there that I didn't even realize was there um so in that simple just you
just saying hi and greeting me it um it touched me forever and um I just
remember like coming and just being so touched like there was a difference that
I felt when I first came to 5f than I had felt in any other church that I had been in I had love Jesus my whole entire
life I was a Believer my mom raised me to know Jesus um but I did not have like
close relationship with him I was really lukewarm I was you know just everywhere
like my focus was not completely on God and I was not surrendered at all but and
I never had encountered the power and the anointing of God so when I came to
5f I knew that there was something different and it was the anointing it was the anointing that immediately
grabbed a hold of my heart like immediately and I was just like I I want
to be here I just I want to serve I want to be here like what do they need like you know what I just want to be here and
um I didn't care that it was 15 people I I didn't care at all all I knew was that
this was something special and as I stayed and as I just served really
simply like whatever you had needed at that time but whether it was putting connection cards or envelopes on the
chairs or um turning on like record on the camera at one point or whatever it
was like or putting chairs out and putting the chairs back like it was just simple things like that but I noticed
that I was changing like as I was just serving as I was just coming and just
reing anointing like unbeknownst to me I just was just there and I just loved it you know but the anointing was affecting
my life the anointing was touching me and making me want to surrender to him
like I never had before and I realized the power of the anointing you know even
though at that time like demons weren't being cast out or you know like we weren't seeing like a whole lot of
people like falling back with the power of God like like crazy wild Revival like it wasn't like that but for the first
few years when you first were there yeah yeah yeah so it wasn't like that but the anointing was there and my spirit man
knew it was there and it was like where else could I go like it's like I had
tasted and seen for the first time in my life the goodness of God his anointing
and I didn't want to let it go at all it was it was valuable to me it was to go
it was precious and I knew that it was something that you could find everywhere
so I didn't want to let go of it and um you had been so instrumental in my life
too you had met with me for breakfast and that was brand new too like oh my
gosh like the pastor of the church wants to like beat with me for breakfast you know like I I was really
touched by that and I had recognized like in that breakfast me I had just like I just Unleashed everything to you
and I just like opened up like I had never opened up to anyone before and now looking back I realized it was just the
anointing that you were carrying that just made me just want to be so vulnerable to you and you were so
instrumental at that time of my life of like helping me to see things clearly
that I was really confused about and um because of that I let things go and God
was able to pour more into me he was he was able to change me more because of
your example of your just you just guiding me simply and I changed and as I
just came every single Sunday I changed every single week I had this
joy in me that I had never had before I was I was just so full of joy and I was
willing to let go of everything every relationship that wasn't of God anything
that he didn't want in my life I wanted to let it go for him that was what the anointing did and because of that I I
let relationships go and I was like I'm here I'm fully Focus I'm here at 5f I'm
not leaving and um and I just changed I
changed simply by serving I changed simply by coming consistently never
leaving and um as time went on a couple months later you know there
was a falling away where several people had left because of like lies and schemes of the enemy and we had gotten
even smaller than 15 and it was a big it was a big testing for the church and at
that time those same people who had left they wanted me to leave you know they said like Johan tall this isn't right
like you know um we don't want you to be manipulated you know like we want like
good for you and we're telling you first because we want to warn you first and I
was like I know what God did for me here I know it I have never changed in my
whole entire life than I have changed when I was at 5f when I encountered the anointing and no matter what you guys
are saying I don't care I'm not leaving I can't leave it's too valuable it's too
precious it's too amazing for me to let go of Mama's too amazing for me to let go
of you were amazing you were incredible so loving so kind and you would change
my life by just your encouraging your words and I was not going to let that go I didn't care who thought I was crazy
which they did so many people thought I was crazy I lost friends I they they
fell away because they thought I was not in my right mind but I knew what God had
did for me and I knew that it was the truth and I stayed and through all those
circumstances and it happening over and over again I stayed I stayed planted I I
realized that even God was testing me in that and I grew stronger and stronger as
I stayed through every single trial every single time people tried to pull me away I stayed and because of that I
grew even more I changed even more by just staying consistently planted where
God wanted me to be no matter what people said at all it was just him he
said I want you at 5f I want you to serve at 5f and I and I held on to that
and I never let it go and I changed and I grew and I learned and I I just
transformed incredibly like like I never had before just by staying still just by
being where God wanted me to be and just being obedient in that simple way just
doing that changed my entire life and when I look back about how God has
brought us to this place how he has transformed 5f and
Revival breaking out incredibly in countries and
cities I cannot be happier that I
stayed it was truly I truly am an awe and I'm so grateful that I was just like
no I was stubborn in a good way I was not going to let what God gave me go and
because of that I've got to witness incredible wonders of God and that is
why it's my heart for people to know the value of being planted to know the value
of staying where God wants you to be no matter what people say no matter what videos pop up it doesn't matter all that
matters is what God wants and if he is calling you to be at 5 f he's calling
you to be planted Stay Stay you will never ever regret it all you will see is
God move in your life move in your family's life change you transform you
pour anointing in you have you be completely surrendered and encounter his
joy and peace like never before that is what will happen only good and amazing
perfect gifts from God when you are steadily obedient to what God wants you
to do so that is one of the main things I've learned be planted where God wants
you to be stay still let him mold you let him transform you let
him radically change your life and all you have to do is stay still all you
have to do is just be still be still and serve be still and obey God
amen praise God all glory to God thank you
Jesus and so you know I've of course gone through so many just like
situations of critics saying all sorts of things um spiritual attacks um I've
experienced so much of that of the enemy wanting to stop me the enemy wanting to stop the work of God so much
um just resistance and I know that I never
encountered that until I stepped into the anointing yeah until I stepped into my calling and it was like even just the
first year even before I'm seeing demons manifest and being cast out even before I'm seeing great Miracles happening in
the ministry I'm finding this wild attack like I've never found never faced
before um jealousy like I've never faced before before um evil like I've never
encountered before like like people making up lies and spreading them and
that's what you're talk what you were talking about yeah like early on when we had we we we had about 20 people and
then we went down to 15 and that was when around the time you came I believe and then we went down to 10 and that was
still there that was that happened because of the story that you were sharing and then there was five and then
there was two and the big reason us to and that was during Co um and when
then we went outside and then the Revival broke out in the Park yeah when there was two of
us um or that year that there was two of us but um so yeah but the the reason it was
decreasing all that time was really because of the resistance of the enemy yeah how and it opened my eyes like wow
this anointing is powerful like I've never faced this kind of spiritual
warfare in my life um attacks from the devil in my life and so I mean for me
gratefully I I could renew my mind I had the spiritual eyes eyesight from knowing
the word of God knowing the stories of David and Joseph and how and Jesus how
anyone who really carried anointing the devil was so angry at that anointing and
wanted to do anything in his power to to stop them so it encouraged me it
encouraged me like wow the only thing that can explain this kind of evil the way people are
behaving these things happening to me the only thing that can explain it is the devil's angry and this is truly
anointing I have received powerful anointing and this calling on my life this prophecy I received must be true
yeah um but I just wanted to ask you what you've learned uh about what you've
learned about like the spiritual warfare that comes with being anointed serving
in a ministry that's anointed what you've learned about these critics you know you went from that first time you
you mentioned about people were telling trying to save you or something you know they're trying to save you we're warning
you you know what do you have to say to them to other critics you've seen to the
people out there that Wonder you know you faced this so many times with me yeah you know standing with me yeah what
do you have to say about that it comes with being in the anointing the critics
come with that the enemy wants nothing more than to pull you away from the anointing from where
God wants you to be that is his number one goal when he sees that you have come
into that place he's like oh no what do I got to do to remove this person so he
will throw everything he can he will throw like videos he will throw critics
friends family any person that he can get or video online to discourage you to
to try to make you doubt have skepticism in what you have received he
will do it and it's just because it's anointing it's just because this is a
Ministry that is destroying his kingdom it is not a lukewarm Ministry so it's going to come with it so it's so
important for you to hold on to what God has done for you where God has planted
you like stay still know that this is what God has done in my life I've never
experienced this type of change in my life and I'm not going to let it go and
when friends and family and critics or videos pop up just know that it's a part
of the enemy trying to pull you away it's literally 1+ 1 equals 2 it's just
that he just he doesn't want you to be there he doesn't want you to grow he doesn't want you to be equipped he
doesn't want you to be a powerful disciple a warrior of Jesus he doesn't want you to understand the spiritual
principles of coming under a spiritual mother and just staying still and just being equipped and learning being
discipled he doesn't want any of those things those are powerful keys to the kingdom of God of your growth and to the
growth of the his God's kingdom moving forward every person is so important to
God's plans and his kingdom going forward so if he can pull one person here one person there one person there
by critics family members or videos anything he can do he feels like he's
winning so we just have to stay strong and know that these are all schemes of
the enemy always renew your mind that this is the enemy coming in this way God
changed my life God healed me God delivered me here in this anointing this is the truth this is the fruit this is
what I'm going to hold on to everything else who cares yeah the devil is a liar
amen he is a liar and we have to remember that we have to be aware of his schemes if Eve had been more aware of
his schemes she wouldn't have fell for the scheme Eve fell for this lie of the
devil twisting it like twisting God's heart and character portraying God to be
someone he was not someone who was deceptive manipulating but God was
nothing but pure and full of love and God's true anointed leaders they are
like him they are pure they have servant Hearts they are humble and the devil
just does the same scheme with twisting trying to get people to second guess
what they've tasted and seen um trying to feed them with these lies maybe
you're being duped you know maybe it's a scam maybe you know this person isn't
who you think they are and we have to be aware of these schemes it's it's in the
word uh false accusations were made about um Joseph this woman says he tried
to sleep with me and that's what got him in prison is the his people believing
this false accusation and so you see that work of the devil to to stop the
work of God going forth through Joseph you see that same
twisting uh so demonic so evil of the devil and so you don't find that
happening in ministries or Servants of God that don't have the anointing because the devil's not terrified of
them so you got to be aware once you find where the power of God is once you've come and receiv received where
the anointing is you have to be ready for the Bible to come alive in area
don't be like Eve you know don't fall for the devil's schemes be ready be be
aware of these ways of the lies of the devil and make sure you hold on to the
truth that God has revealed to you you will know them by their fruits so when you've tasted and seen the fruits
remember what you've tasted and seen so nothing can pull you out of God's will
yes Hallelujah so you were mentioning before you know what how it you've learned the
power of being planted and serving uh and I've seen you be
passionate about this and I would just love for you to share your heart more in
this because I see your passion because you know not everyone
has a high Revelation a big revelation of the things of the Kingdom the
spiritual realm you think about how Peter you know he had a higher
revelation of who Jesus was Jesus says to the disciples who do you say that I
am and people are saying well some are saying that you're like Elijah like a prophet others are saying you're like
this they're they're saying you know you're like a teacher you're like a prophet but nobody's saying Messiah like
really who Jesus was the the highest truth yeah it's true he's a teacher it's true he's a prophet but you're missing a
lot if that's all you're seeing Peter however said you're the Messiah and
Jesus then granted him the Keys of the Kingdom there was this reward That Came Upon
Peter's life spiritual reward there was a lifting in the spiritual realm a lifting to be a leader because of how he
could see in the spiritual realm more than others and so I see this upon you
that you know you you have a higher Revelation in regards
to the principles of the Kingdom the principles of serving the principles of humility the princip of being planted
you have a higher revelation of the power in that and the importance of it
and that's the way to go higher and so I know that's where this passion comes from because you see and
others don't see it's almost like Peter saying uh you're the Messiah and the others are like what you know so I'd
love for you to share just your heart on that yeah um you know it's just one
thing that I hunger for every person who comes and visits 5f and wants to be a
part of 5f to really grasp this powerful principle of being planted of serving
and allowing for God's timing in everything how my heart just cries out just for
people to really understand that God has amazing plans for you and it's perfect
timing but it's so valuable and so important to just simply serve and not
even think about what's going to come next or not even think about how God is
going to do this with you here in this ministry or do this but to literally just completely be focused on serving
him and just learning and being equipped there's so many keys and so many like
valuable things that you have taught me that I have grown from just by you just
sharing it with me and just by me listening and just focusing on that just by I'm going to listen to Mama I'm going
to take everything she says I'm going to meditate on it and I'm just going to serve him I don't know what he wants me
to do tomorrow I don't know what he wants me to do in a couple of years and it doesn't matter I just I'm going to
remain focused on that focused on receiving from my spiritual mother focused on serving him and everything
else like not to focus on like or even if you're like passionate about being like a minister or you you know like to
lay that aside for a moment or for a long time because you don't know God's
timing on anything or his specific plans for you but my heart just cries out for
every person who comes to 5f to just realize this principle that don't worry
about the plans God has for you tomorrow or the next day but just worry about
what he wants you to receive right now now he wants you to receive his equipping and teaching and his love and
just to serve his kingdom just to serve his church that's what he just wants you to focus on and everything else comes at
the right time and it comes later I had no clue that I was going to be traveling
with you or that the Revival is going to break out this way I had no clue I mean
you had said you know Revival is now and I was like amen Revival is now amen you
just always declared that prophetic word and I I ran with it I held on to it and I ran with it but as we went through
like different trials and as we were just there and not seen Revival aser scen now I just focused on just serving
him I just was so happy to just receive and learn be discipled and grow and
serve however he wanted me to whether it was behind the scenes um what it didn't
matter like I just wanted to be where God wanted me to be and I saw change
just by that so I just want everyone to really understand the value of that
understand how it's so important to just serve just take your time let God do his
work in you let him like transform you equip you let him do everything and when
he wants you to go to another level if he does then he will he wants it for you
more than you do but it's so so important to just stay still focus on
serving focus on being equipped there's so much to learn I'm I learn constantly from you every single day there's so
much to learn there's so much to grow from and if we could just stay in that
mindset of I'm just here to serve I'm just here to learn from my spiritual
mother that's all and whatever God wants me to do does he want me to be a five-fold minister does he want me to
clean the toilets I don't know and that's okay but stay in that place
because as you're humble in that place then God lifts you to incredible places that you would have never known I would
have never thought that I would be seeing Revival break out in countries
and states like for a year and a half consistently every single week I would
have never envisioned that for myself at all and never would have thought that those were God's plans for me for me
like why me I don't understand it it's still blows my mind to this day I don't
get it but he has these amazing plans for all of us for every single one of
his children but if we could just stay simple if we can just serve him and let
him blow our minds let him do it let him shock us and surprise us he has he has
these amazing plans for us so we can rest in him we can rest in that truth
that he has these amazing plans and we don't got to worry about what we're supposed to be or you know how fast
we're supposed to be doing or you know laying hands on people and seeing them delivered all those things are
wonderful but let God decide let God decide on timing let him let him decide
on whether that's for you or if he has another thing for you but no matter matter what he has for you it's good
it's amazing it's shocking that's what he has so I just I
cry for our 5f family and for new people who are coming to 5f to just understand
that principle rest serve him let God do
what he wants to do in his timing don't worry about it at all he will bless you
just serve him just learn just be equipped just take your
time amen and you know you really are like my Jonathan and it's it's absolutely God
ordained it's wild because your name is Jean tall like John Jean
tall it's so prophetic and actually H all these prophetic amazing
signs confirmations my birthday is 0 1 0111 and your birthday is 1 0 1 0 101
October 10th yeah so it was it's just beautiful all of the the confirmations
and signs from God and um you know your heart is so beautiful and it's really
just this servant heart and I always I remember years ago I just wanted people to learn from your heart
because people need to learn what it's like to be like an Elisha an Elisha to
Elijah or like a Timothy to a Paul and that is like you you are like the
servant of the servant of God is it says in the Bible that Elisha was a servant of the servant of God and that just
simply means like the anointing Came Upon Elijah for example servant of God
and God gave him this plan this assignment like I want like you are in
charge or responsible of accomplishing this task and then God is like I'm going to bring other people alongside you to
help you do this task but like you're the leader like you carry the
responsibility like how the shepherd carries the responsibility of the sheep yeah you know so that's what the meaning
of servant of God is and then Servants of the servant of God so everybody's doing the same thing they're all doing
the work of God they're all playing their part but the servants are supposed
to be humble and submit themselves and say yes to the vision that God gave the
Elijah the the servant of God or the Paul and just say what can I do to help
make this work of God that God assigned you go forth and realize that God has called them to the same thing this is
their calling and they are so important you know and so you have many people
chasing after being Servants of God and not chasing after being servants Servants of Servants of God and that's
where they miss it because maybe God did intend them to be a servant of God or maybe he didn't maybe he did have a plan
for them to be a servant of the servant of God but bless them mightily lift them so high for his glory someone like you
he is lifted you know like I mean you you're blessed you're you're you're able
to travel the world to do the work of God you know just being able to be where
other people can't in terms of like proximity like to me for example and be
like be used by God so powerfully as you sing as you sing worship as you lead worship Etc like God Has Lifted you God
has blessed you God has favored you for his glory but that occurred because of
your heart of humility and submission and servanthood if you never did those things God couldn't lift you because you
did those things those principles of God that God demands from us we can't go around it and do it our own way because
you did those things he lifted you and that's your heart's cry and my heart's
cry for other people to learn these principles because you see people chase
they're trying to lift themselves but the Bible says Those Who exalt themselves will be humbled those who
humble themselves will be lifted will be blessed and favored by God and
so see your value see like understand that God does want to lift you stop
trying to lift yourself stop trying to make it happen in your own when you make it happen in your own strength you
you're doing the opposite of going higher God's hum having to Humble you God's having to push you down when he
doesn't want to he wants to lift you high for his glory he wants to lift you high and make you shine so bright and so
you want to shine bright God wants you to shine bright but there's a way there's a way to get high and shine
bright and it's The Humbling yourself way being a servant of God just dying to
your ego and doing it God's way so right now God is calling his
people to be on the front lines of the Revival Army to be in very important places in this revival Army but he's
only going to place those in the important very the most important High raking places those who will humble
themselves those who will be have servant hearts and do it God's way
speaking of you being a worship amazing anointed worship leader you have an
amazing story when it comes to that like a lot of people wouldn't wouldn't know that you thought you had an awful voice
and you had sing earlier in your life like you you sang I mean you made music
like you were taking it seriously like this music am ambition of music yeah
pursuit of music I mean and then things happened and you decided you were never
going to sing publicly again only in the shower to God right yes so can you share
about that and how you got to where you're now where you're leading worship all the time at 5f church it's
pure obedience to God um like you had said I had been pursuing music to an
extent uh with my cousin we were like singing We would write songs and um I I
thought at one point that it was going to go far you know um but uh as I
recorded and as I sang for other people I got a lot of negative criticism about
my voice and um it was kind of repetitive and I started to really
believe them the devil is a liar and then and then yeah and um I was
comfortably believing them like it wasn't a fight it wasn't like no
like it was like you're right my voice is average like you know like I just
went along with it and because of all that criticism I was like you know what Lord I'm hanging it up like I don't I
don't need to sing for people like I really don't like my voice is not that great people don't really like it so
that's fine I'm just going to sing to you like in my shower in my house
quietly and it'll just be you hearing my voice for the rest of my life and I was
so confident that that was God's plan for me like I was just like Lord this is definitely your plan great amen and I
just like walked away from it for for years I did not sing for years and uh
when I came to fth um it was probably like I don't know maybe two months after
and you had asked me to sing and you would never even heard my voice like you
just asked me to sing and I was like okay now when I think about me seeing
okay I was like I don't know why I said okay because I had already convinced myself for years and I told myself I am
never singing again like this is just what's going to happen but when you asked I was just like
okay and um it just started from there and it that was 2018 I started singing
and it was it was a struggle it was really it was hard but I knew that this
is what God wanted I knew that this was his plan for me I didn't know for how long or you know how he wanted to
multiply it but I was just like okay I I'll sing and Lord this is really
uncomfortable for me like this is really a stretching like people are going to hear me sing they're going to hear my
voice I'm really uncomfortable about this but if this is what you want I say
yes and every single and this back then we were small still so but we would
still have worship nights on Fridays and and Sundays and every single Friday
night worship every single Sunday worship you would encourage me every
single time I would get off the stage and or it would be the end of the service and you would just automatically
just come and encourage me and say you sounded so beautiful you were amazing you were powerful and I was like really
are you sure like I don't know like I was really like not secure
with my said and um you did that for years for years
I did not become actually like comfortable with my voice probably until like last year but every single week I
got up on the stage and I was it was just pure obedience pure obedience I did not want to be up there you know that I
was just like God you wanted me okay and I just did it every single week and he
strengthened me through that like through your encouraging words it built me up I needed that time I needed that
encouragement to to help me to believe in what God wanted me to do and it was
it was necessary and it it took time it took time of me just saying yes every
single week and being uncomfortable for a while and just you just consistently pouring encouraging words into my life
and and and then eventually I start to feel okay and comfortable but it was
it was all just because he wanted me to not because I wanted to at all and um
when sometimes people come up to me and they say I have an amazing voice and it really just shocks me like it really it
really does but um God really really moved upon my life
he really healed a really deep wound with that um and something that I was
not expecting him to do at all I didn't know he wanted wanted me to sing I didn't know you know I had no clue of
his plans in this way all I knew is that he just wanted for this moment so I was like okay and he truly built me up
through you and through that I learned the power of encouraging people encouraging your
brothers and sisters I mean without your encouragement every single week I would not be able to sing to this day like I
would still feel like incredibly uncomfortable like really in my head hearing the lies of the enemy your voice
is not good it's it's average and you know but through the encouraging words
over and over and over again the lies the enemy left they they flee my mind
praise God and speaking of
encouraging when I think of just how I made it through those times
of ministering at fivefold church for the first first few years when we had 20 and then 15 and then 10 and then five
and then two when I think about like how did I make it through that how um first
of all it was a big reason it was so difficult for me was because preaching
speaking public speaking and preaching was my biggest fear and weakness and I simply believed the
prophecy from my spiritual father Prophet Dr Jord Davy he spoke God has called you to be an apostle of Jesus
Christ and I just simply believe that that was God speaking so Apostles teach
they teach a lot that's one of their big callings is to teach to preach to teach
and so I knew this is my calling and I was like I don't know how this is going
to happen but I I trust God I believe God like Moses Moses was like I stutter
how am I going to do this but God said I made your mouth you know I'm going to give you the words to speak don't worry
about it just trust me just obey and so that's what I did um but it was still
really hard I I believed that God was going to equip me and God would move through me and God would give me the words but week after week for literally
about three is years pretty much until the Revival broke out so that was about
three years of of ministering every single Sunday and throughout the week um
every single time I didn't feel comfortable every single time I would battle the the
enemy's lies every time I got up to preach yeah I would feel like you're not good enough I would feel like you're not
powerful enough you're not really a preacher like this isn't who you are you know that's is not what you're good at
and people aren't being blessed and then people would leave and so that would then then the enemy would speak this is
why they're leaving you're not good enough you're not powerful enough I didn't mean to compare myself to others but if I would ever see someone preach
on Instagram or something I would immediately think oh my gosh I sound
nothing like that I am they sound like a preacher I don't sound like a preacher I struggled with that for years internally
but I just kept showing up to preach simply because obedience to God was all I cared about it trumped the feelings of
insecurity so but but like a big way I had I was able to be strengthened by the
Lord to preach to get up there and preach every single time even though I
didn't feel like didn't feel good was your encouragement I remember it was pretty much every single Sunday you
would from the heart tell me your word blessed me your word touched me I needed
that word and every time I felt shocked you said you felt shocked when people would tell you you know your voice is
beautiful I felt shocked because I would look at people's faces they didn't seem that
like moved you know sometimes the faces looked kind of blank as I'm speaking so I'd finish it thinking like like I don't
know if that was very good you know if that was very powerful if people were touched by God through me I don't know
but you would speak to me the truth you know that God really did move through me
and the word blessed you and so I thank you for that and I you know you have taught me even more through your example
the power of encouragement Hallelujah well I'm so proud of you for just being obedient to
God and and doing what was uncomfortable yourself and allowing God to use your weaknesses and the Bible says you know
Paul says I boast in my weaknesses God's glory is and power is revealed more
through my weaknesses and God says I use the weak and foolish things so that no
to confound the wisdom of the wise and also so no one may boast and it's so true it keeps you humble like the fact
that I can Preach Today and people tell me I'm touched by your word I never go to this place of like yeah I have a
great gift I immediately go to this place of wow God thank you for using me
like I know this is only you it just you know like I immediately in my mind go to go to God go to like
wow where my strengths it's it's not as easy to go there you're like yeah yeah I'm comfortable with this I'm good at
this you know so I've seen really the beauty of how it makes you more humble
and give all the glory to God when you give God your weaknesses and let him use
them for his glory if there was one thing that you could tell anybody who's watching and
listening we have this is an opportunity to speak to people if there's just something that's been burning in your
heart do you want to share with people just just something you want them to
know the anointing at 5f is real everything that you see at 5f is
real and let go of any type of skepticism let
go any type of doubt I think that would be like my heart to really just come as a child
just come and just see this is Jesus I might not fully understand everything
and that's okay God is Way Beyond my understanding I have no clue like all
the workings and the mysteries of God and that's okay but I know that this is
real so I I would say that be humble be like a
child and know that it's real and let God confound you let him shock you with
his Mysteries and his principles and different ways of doing things that he had that we have maybe seen in churches
before um just religion or tradition let him break off tradition let him break
off religion and let him show you his truth and just be open and just receive
and just take it all in because it's real amen
amen well I I know with all my heart that anyone who is listening to this
watching this right now that your life has been changed that this anointed word
that's come forth this testimony has broken off Lies Of The Devil in your
life I see spiritually that where there was confusion now there is Clarity where the devil had kept you
in bondage of just being confused and stuck and not seeing rightly now you can
see you can see the truth and I see this grace of God upon this this this podcast
right now to every one of you listening watching this grace of eyes being opened

now that every lie of the devil be exposed in your life every way the devil
has lied to you about your identity about your giftings just speaking lies like you're
not good enough to be used by God speaking lies like you're not a good enough singer you're not a good enough
speaker or whatever the LIE is I expose that lie and I declare that spirit that
line Spirit speaking against your identity trying to hold you back from being a powerful vessel of God walking
in your calling it must leave you in Jesus name may your eyes open up now and see

so many moving parts to flourish there's so many things to do and sometimes like
I would get like my mind would just get into like okay there's this to do
checklist and God really shocked me like especially during the impartation
session he like it it was such like a holy time it really felt like I didn't
want to sing I didn't want to do anything I just wanted to sit still and just just bask in the presence of God it
was such a holy holy time and I was not expecting him to touch me and touch the
serving team like he did and he just blew us all away I mean so many of us
fell back with the power of God we were completely completely shocked about how
he moved and I just remember like after that I was just set even more on fire
just even more full of joy it felt like God had just poured like more anointing
into me like everything I just released until like putting everything together in so many checklists like it just felt
like he was just like you emptied out here I go filling you it really felt like that like he just filled me
completely and I I'm like forever changed like after that I I just I have
