i knew
[Music] [Applause]
i did from all these things now and i commit every spirit of time to be
concrete i went to a ministry school all these teachers would come in every single week i was so hungry to hear the
voice of god that i just took on this teaching full on any thought that lines up with the word gives life you know
it's god prophetic words were thrown out all over the place because i had all these teachings from everywhere my head
was a mess and by the end of that season i was like crumbling which you would think is the opposite for the intention
of going to a ministry school so i came across your video for the first time on instagram and i just immediately knew
something was different i saw deliverance happening i said "this is what we're supposed to be doing this is it." told my brother "we got to go to
la." that's when i came we saw you in the park that's when things really started to get going i started to murmur
my lips were just locked and i remember an evilness came over me it was just this overwhelming darkness that was very
very afraid when you said "everybody just give god praise." literally on the
dot as everyone started to cheer and shout jesus like i just slammed the
ground really hard forcefully and started to scream at the top of my lungs and i started to crawl as i was crawling
you were there and i saw jesus standing about 3 ft to the right of you there was
no question about it it was time for what was inside of me to obey
welcome to the revival is now podcast i can't wait for what god is about to do
through the screen i've been in awe by how he has moved through testimonies
through his power as people watch these podcasts listen to these podcasts so i
can't wait for what god's going to do today in your life and i have a guest with me today he is planted at 5f church
from orchid blake so great to have you here thank you it's
a real blessing to be here for sure hallelujah thank you i vividly remember
um seeing your deliverances how powerfully god moved upon you and set
you free and i was left in awe of jesus seeing him free you and i know many were
as well and i'm so happy that many more people can hear your story from oppression to freedom and abundant life
so let's just get into your story right now i want to hear what your life was like
before you were delivered well um i was raised a christian um and
but it was in a very religious uh religion and so um my heart i always
remember as a kid my heart just i always had a heart for god but i just didn't have you know um any clue how to do it
and uh yeah my first impression was seeing kids my age raising their hands
in worship and i said "whoa you know um that's different." and and it just from
there just step by step by step uh searching for more searching for more
searching for more searching for the real thing and my christian walk is what led me to fivefold church in the park
seeing you on instagram um to yeah where i now call home home
forever this is home um so yeah my story goes really just i mean
i just if i were to think back there's lots of steps and it seems like
um you know every every room in my house has just every little step has just been
just getting cleaned getting cleaned like your spiritual house my spiritual house
my spiritual house yeah lots of cleaning um you know and and just i who knows
what would have happened if i had just this church you know this five-fold church when i was a kid like who knows
but the fact is my story my timeline has looked like this and
um so you know i think letting my heart go to
churches that are different and not what i was used to and just wanting god at the end of the day just wanting jesus
um is what led me here at the end of the day um nothing more and so yeah along
the way i you know like um i was baptized in the holy spirit in
my early 20s and uh didn't have really any direction it i was just flailing
around i would i remember going from church to church trying to explain what had happened being baptized in the holy
spirit having this that experience and no one could just give me an answer and it was just this runaround i was just
searching for answers like i wanted to know more i was so hungry um
yeah and so went from church to church to church and along the way i just
roller coaster you know just in the flesh sinning going to church really
honestly like doing my best but i was a lot of flesh was just hanging out mhm
and um a lot flesh was strong but i had a heart for god you know and so despite
my falls and the doors that i was opening i had a heart for god like i
just you know um kept searching just kept searching so
i yeah so along the way i found this okay so just
before i found five fold church um i went to a ministry school and just to
sum it up this was a time in my life where i was hungry for god i'd been baptized in the holy spirit years prior
and i was going to this ministry school and it was like a b like what you how you uh mention is like a buffet of
teachers and i with good intentions just tried my
best to just hear the voice of god and uh you know
there was lots of teachings about how to hear the voice of god it was all over the place all these teachers would come
in every single week and you know there it was a this was a blessing in my life at this time but at the same time um i
was so hungry to hear the voice of god that uh i just took on this teaching full on
that was essentially um kind of just emptying your mind and
any thought that lines up with the word um gives life you you know it's god mhm
and in this culture it was just prophetic words were thrown out all over
the place and everyone did the best they could but in my heart i slowly became a
shell of my person a shell of myself um with this teaching trying to hear the
voice of god i did the best that i could but it was just something was off
so i uh i was in tennessee at the time i
moved back to seattle to just get back to my roots where i was born and raised and just find myself just it was a
desperate attempt and this whole time i now because i had all these teachings from everywhere
um that my head was a mess essentially let's just so my head was you know the
practice was journal god what should i eat for breakfast today and then you respond really yeah well you know yeah
like he's a friend and it was like really like yeah yeah like you know it was you know
um that was kind of the relationship that was taught and
whether it was from the teacher whether it was from a student it was just picked up mhm right you know just hungry and so
that just essentially brought a lot of confusion and i
um was really just in my head it was like do this do that trying to make big
life decisions trying to thoughts coming in your head do this do that correct and so you were going like
here there everywhere that's exactly that's exactly right and you know giving prophetic words that you're just like
well i hope it's i hope that's god and if it's not it'll just fall off mhm um
you know that was kind of like the little cleanup prayer anything that's not a you god it just let it fall away
and um and then you're just walking away with all these hundreds of prophetic words and you're like what do i do with
all these you know and i mean i was hungry i just took i i just took
everything in i was just like a fire hose and i took it all in and by the end of that season and i when i moved back
to seattle i was like "oh man what's going on?" you know i was
like crumbling which you would think is the opposite for the intention of going to a ministry
school mhm so yeah um when i was in seattle um i
started to backslide and i started to drink a little more and i was starting
to just like i was trying to purge myself from everything that
you know i had so much noise in my head and i just wanted to just like take a step back in the best way that i knew
how was just to like quiet the voice and by quieting that voice to me was quieting god's voice in my head like i
thought that was thought it was god and i was just trying to decipher and all that so um
yeah uh i took tried to take a step back the best i could and i was in mexico
and i was hung over in bed and i was scrolling and i had been following you
now for about a month so i came across your video for the first time on instagram
um late december early january 2022 and i had them walk just you would just
come by for you would i would be scrolling and you would pop up a few times and i just immediately knew
something was different and i was yeah i i was like i i saw jesus in your
eyes um you were just so selfless like when you would speak at that time i had
heard every teaching under the sun and when you came across my instagram it was
like this isn't about you this isn't about you it was safe just
immediately i was just this is safe and there was no
question in my heart like who are you what's your background what's your story it was just like this is safe
and um and so yeah so that was for about a month until i was in mexico and i was
hung over and i came across your video again and i saw deliverance happening and i
had seen deliverance before and i'm in bed hung over feeling horrible and i see
what you're doing and uh i say this is what we're supposed to be doing like this is it this is it no like you know
trying to come up with answers after you pray and then nothing happens and no like all this gray area of you know um
uh just trying to fill in the blanks yourself and it was just
pure um so yeah when i i came back from my trip
in mexico i told my brother grant i said "we got to go to la let's go i'm going
do you want to come?" and he came and uh that's when i came we saw you in the
park and um that's when things really start started to get going yeah so yes yeah
that's kind of the i remember that day very vividly in the park we were in the dirt in the
mud yeah yeah and jesus set you free

all of these things now and i commit every spirit of touch come on three 1 2
3 out of completely now in jesus name
thank you jesus you want to share what experience of the deliverance that day
yeah so you know i was really excited i was just really excited for this i had
been again i'd been following you for a bit just a month month and a half and um
i remember i was sitting on the hill and i felt like i was like a disciple in like like out of the bible like just
outside i was you know i was so done with like the theatrics and just all
that stuff just wanted the pure gospel i didn't know you were outside maybe because of co i was just you were
outside doing it on a mic i was like this is it this is it like there is no
fluff here and um and so i just remember watching you observing you and i was
sitting there on the grass and i was like "this is awesome." i mean this is great and um
yeah so but so i had a lot of noise in my head right leading up to this whole
time and you know and i'm watching you and and yet i'm not in my head thinking like oh man like i was just listening
and receiving from the message that's what was happening and when you your
message finished and then there was a ministry time everyone got up and
deliverance started happening and i remember watching and observing and then
like popcorn couple table deliverance i'm observing i'm watching again my head
like is i'm just hanging out nothing crazy you know
and i remember as time went on just maybe 5 10 minutes
i started to like murmur and it was like
like that it was like and i remember like this so i came with a full list because i've
watched you for a bit i came with a list but as i was standing there i wanted to
speak the list and my lips were like locked shut and i could it was it was
not wanting me to speak um it didn't want me to repent out loud and so i was
just locked my lips were just locked and my head like i'm doing her like my head just started to look at you and it
started to shake like this mhm and my body was my my head it was just looking
at you like it it was really intimidated and um
and this went on and my head just started to just and i remember an evilness came over me and i was looking
at you and um it was just this overwhelming evil darkness that was very
very afraid and it was like blake took a step blake was in the back seat at this
point blake was not doing anything but standing there with a list that i came
up with days before and blake is just
just loving what he's saying and then all of a sudden blake is murmuring with his head shaking watching you watching
deliverance happening and it just progressed it built it built it built and then when you said "everybody just
give god praise." everyone just on the count of three just lift up your arms and give god god
praise mhm and when that happened on the count of three one two three and
everyone just arms up and as literally on the dot as as
everyone started to cheer and get shout jesus uhhuh i hit the ground on one knee it was like
a like out of a super hu like just like a m like i just slammed the ground really hard forcefully and started to
scream at the top of my lungs and i started to crawl and as i was crawling
um you were standing there you had brown shoes
and i that's all i could see is like i couldn't see anything more i was just crawling because what was inside of me
knew who was boss it knew who was the boss and um there was no question about
it it was like it was time for what was inside of me to obey and i so i saw my head is down but you
were there and i saw jesus
standing about 3 ft here's you jesus was
standing about 3 ft to the right of you um and i didn't see definition in his
face but it was just he was just this glow and i i didn't i it was in the
spirit like i i saw him but it wasn't in this it wasn't in the physical but i saw him and he was standing there and um
it was just so terrified and i was screaming at the top of my lungs and i was crawling on the dirt
and um i lost my voice that day it was like you know i know other people in the
past have have when they were delivered like you you know their head falls on
the on a toe of someone like protection this was for me i literally had bloody
knees and i lost my voice at the end of the day and it just showed that like he
ju he just god just wanted me delivered he just whatever it takes whatever it
takes and um right before i hit the ground two things two things rushed to
my mind like that i had a whole list of things to repent of and two things specifically came to my mind and one was
this relationship that i had prior there was this girl and she was in witchcraft
and um that came to my mind and um false
holy spirit came to my mind and i so as i'm crawling and then you put
the mic in front of my face i just from the deepest parts of my soul my heart i
with that relationship it was i i you know um i knew it was wrong is what i
tried to get out that's what was coming from the deepest parts of my heart i knew it was wrong and and then um
also the voice this false holy spirit where i open this door to just
wanting to hear god's voice but along the way being young in the faith pride
flesh not knowing i opened up this door to this voice that i thought was god
and it um uh that's what came to my mind as i was on the ground screaming and it was this
even though i was tricked i also like i somewhere along the line like i made a decision to not know if it was god or
not and it just made a way for chaos and so it was like this responsibility of me
to repent despite being tricked or whatever like it was this responsibility to repent and that moment came where i
spoke it with the mic in front of you put your mic in front of my lips and
next thing you know i just i felt like a heavy blanket come off of me and i
started to look up at this guy and just relieved and you said um you pointed and
you said leave him and and it just it left and yeah the sky was bluer than it's ever and yeah and i fell backwards
and i knew i knew i knew what had exactly what had just happened and yeah
praise god that was hallelujah that was hallelujah praise god praise god yeah
praise god it's amazing so what was life after that like how did you see the true
deliverance from the false holy spirit slash angel of light the devil
disguising himself as an angel of light afterwards
um it was really quiet you know it was quiet in my mind um i just essentially
had a sound mind like that's what happened and um you know it took time to
fill what had left but let me tell you after
when time as time went on i just had such a such a reverence and wanted to be
so so careful hearing his voice it was just so like
just this deep reverence like "oh my goodness oh my goodness."
um and i really just began to
eat every single word that you spoke like it was just full on like
i saw jesus 3 ft from you i said "there's no there there's no other way
about this this is where i am this is home this is where i'm supposed to be receiving game over game over i'm home."
um and yeah so i just ate every teaching that
you spoke and my you know as you spoke and the days after that the weeks after the months the years it's just been this
real diligent diligent effort to um
to because i know what it's like when man teaches and i receive man's
teachings and it just gets really gray but as you speak the anointing is is
what's teaching me the anointing is teaching me it's not um
you're just you're you're not in the way you're not there it's it's like and
that's a powerful revelation of the scripture that says you don't need anyone to teach you the anointing has
taught you well it's not saying that anyone should teach you because we see
in the five-fold ministry is to equip us we see that the apostles they were
teaching in the book of acts it says they were the believers were constantly devoting themselves to the apostles
teaching so what it's speaking of is just what you said that you should not
be taught by man like man's wisdom like how paul says "i didn't come to you with
wise and persuasive words but i came to you with the demonstration of the power of god." god also says "i'm going to
confound the wise." he's talking about man's wisdom and there's a lot of man or
man and women wisdom um in the christian world where the wisdom isn't coming from
the holy spirit but is coming more like how the pharisees received wisdom from
religious doctrines and just knowledge that wasn't from the holy spirit but
passed down traditions of revelation that was not truly from god so paul
says,"i came to you not not with persuasive words words of wise words but
i came to you with a demonstration of the power of god." so he would teach with the anointing the anointing was
moving through his teachings his words and so that is that that's such a
powerful revelation that you didn't need man without the anointing to teach you that was harming
you even though it was teaching the word of god yes um and sometimes it can even
like be true what is being taught but is not anointing and does not open up
spiritual eyes that gives you understanding like you can say god is good you read
the word god is good in the bible without revelation yes you you can still
be filled with condemnation every day of your life but when you read god is good and god loves you with revelation
it leads you into intimacy and relationship with jesus and and his
grace hallelujah and so we need the anointed word yes taught by vessels of
god so it's jesus himself teaching you because when true vessels of god
servants of god allow god to move through them they get out of the way
they step out of the way and it becomes the word of god coming forth powerful
continue oh hallelujah that's f that what i um god led me to that exact
scripture the anointing is is what teaches you um that scripture is been
the root that is what by the way yeah before you continue context of that
scripture the scripture jesus is saying you don't need any man to teach you the anointing will teach you everything we
have to look at the context and so in that context he was referring to pharisees he was saying and and well
actually when he's saying um you don't need any uh other father he's talking
about people like the pharisees who were wrongly positioning themselves assuming the the
the the place of a spiritual father when god did not anoint them call them to be
a spiritual father in these disciples lives so they were you know puffing themselves up like i know it all i'm a
great teacher thus says the lord but truly they weren't called and anointed so he was speaking specifically about
those pharisees those people um in terms of they should not be your spiritual father go on
yeah yeah i mean i i'm recite as you're speaking i'm reciting it in my head it's
been such a foundational scripture for me since day one i don't know when that
i think it was maybe six month a year yeah maybe a year after uh i was
delivered but that scripture was so in the um
says that as for you the anointing you receive from him remains in you and you
do not need anyone to teach you but just as it has taught you all things remain in him and the last part remain in him
when i when i listen to you apostle whenever i am dry whenever i am
searching for um direction or just guidance or just
wanting to hear his voice i go to the anointed teachings and the remain in him
is what like it's like an umbrella and so when i go to you to listen to you to
listen to the sunday messages the lives it's i'm remaining in him like i'm around physically remaining in him and
um it's been just it's been my safe space like safety like it it feels safe
that scripture just protects me because i know what it's like to receive from man and i know what it's like to receive
from the anointing and it's world's difference um so you know what's life afterwards in
the days since and just receive hearing his voice and like what does that look like now it's um you know just not
wanting like even if i'm reading the scripture it's just i just i can read the scripture and i've read the
scripture before without the anointing and it's like blake's forcing things
blake's forcing answers hearing his voice blake's forcing answers that's how i got myself into trouble the flesh was
strong and it just was muddy and now with a reverence in my heart and an understanding of of the anointing and
being delivered like that faith went up here
and i was like uh the anointing's teaching me that's just
it that's that's it's safe it's just safe yeah praise god
hallelujah yeah thank you jesus praise god wow well
i know so many eyes have been opened up through your testimony um i know so many people are going to be delivered from
the angel of light and false holy spirit today and for those of you watching
maybe maybe you're to you're not really sure like how to discern the angel of
light um the bible says that the devil sometimes masquerades himself as an
angel of light meaning he can say he can sound like god but not really be but not
be god's voice at all you know the devil knew scripture very well and
was reciting scripture to jesus in the wilderness so that's an example of just
because you hear something you could hear even scripture but if it's coming
with a religious revelation you know like for example if what's motivating
you to read the bible is condemnation and you're reading the bible with haste
and feeling like i have to do this or god's so mad at me rather than
seeing jesus wanting you to simply spend spend time with him and seeing jesus wanting you to grow spiritually and have
this precious divine appointment as you open the word so you're excited to meet him there and as you come you're able to
hear his voice because you're coming in the right way with the right motivations not just checking off the list so if you
so so you can be the devil can sometimes you know be feeding you to do these
religious things these things that sound like that you're godly but he is
trapping you to be blinded by god's love and he can lead you astray in this way because he knows when you truly love god
you're not going to be enticed to do witchcraft normally you're not going to be enticed to do the typical sinful
things so he has to come in this sneaky way that's all he has and the main way
to hear god's voice is through his word his written word and
his spoken word logos means written word rama means spoken word so throughout the
bible it teaches us how god equips believers equips the people he speaks
through vessels he equipss and speaks
through servants of god whom he anoints we see this in ephesians 4:11-16
god giving the five-fold ministry to equip the believers and as i shared earlier how the believers were devoting
themselves to the teachings that the apostles were teaching um and so
actually the new testament paul's writing letters it's it's him teaching it's him teaching believers the
believers um god speaking through him and so that's the main way to hear god's
voice is through the bible and through the spoken word through teachings of true anointed leaders specifically whom
god has called you to be planted under the leader of the ministry that god has called you to be planted at and that's
the main way of hearing god's voice is through the bible and through the teachings and i would like to describe
this way of god speaking as a still small voice because as it's coming through the teacher for example you're
not hearing the audible voice of jesus you're not seeing a grand vision
it can seem maybe not so extraordinary because it's a person speaking you can
see it in that way if you're seeing it um carnally rather than seeing it as god
is speaking through the mouth of this vessel right now and reading the bible
um that's the still small voice right it's it's not so whoa like a vision an
audible voice a strong feeling the bible says there's a story in the bible where
um elijah went to seek god's voice wanted to hear god speak and the bible says that he god was not in the wind he
was not in the earthquake he was not in the fire but he was in the still small voice and so
god can move through the earthquake and wind and fire he does sometimes but in this moment he came through the still
small voice and many times believers are wanting to hear god in the earthquake
wind and fire but god is choosing to speak through the still small voice and actually that's the main way he speaks
is through the still small voice he speaks in the other ways but the main way is a still small voice and you can
actually open up a door to the enemy a door to the devil masquerading himself as an angel of light false holy spirit
when you are forceful about hearing god's voice your own way that you are so
persistent god's going to speak through the earthquake god's going to speak through the wind god's going to speak through the fire i want to hear him in
these ways i'm going to keep seeking this way if god is saying "no no no no seek me in the still small voice seek me
in the bible in the word seek me through the teachings of my anointed leader i've appointed to be to to speak through to
you." if he's saying that and you're saying "no i'm going to look this way instead,"
that's opening up a door to the devil masquerading himself as an angel of light and that's where he can then use
people to to speak wrong prophecies that sound good and it can lead people to go
astray and it can lead people to be so fragmented and confused in their mind and say every thought that comes "oh
it's god oh it's god." when a lot of it is the devil masquerading himself as an
angel of light just trying to confuse and lead you astray in this sneaky way
and so i praise god for this testimony the testimony of jesus is the spirit of
prophecy and the the bible says that you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free so with the truth there's
so much truth about the spiritual realm about who god is and truth about the devil's schemes so much truth that is
just come through your testimony and it's prophesying to you out there it's
prophesying to everyone who is watching right now and i see god right now
opening up many eyes all over the world right now who's watching every person who's watching god is going to deliver
you from any way the enemy has tried to blind you from any way he's tried to deceive you thank you jesus i declare
right now that every scheme of the devil to come as an angel of light to bring
confusion it must be broken off your life i speak every spirit coming as an
angel of light must go every spirit bringing you constant thoughts must go
every spirit of condemnation and religion must go in jesus name every
spirit trying to hold you back from knowing god's love and walking in his will and being on fire for jesus this
must go in jesus' name thank you jesus
hallelujah thank you father i release this anointing upon you now may the fire of
the holy spirit fill you may your spiritual eyes open up and may you
hear the holy spirit's voice from now so powerfully so clearly and so
consistently as you read the word may you hear god's voice may you hear his
still small voice and find such contentment and peace in his still small
voice in jesus name amen thank you for joining me on the revival
is now podcast be blessed and i can't wait to see you and talk to you on the
