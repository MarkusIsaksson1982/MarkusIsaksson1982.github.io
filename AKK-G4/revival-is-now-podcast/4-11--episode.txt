i I wasn't sure if masturbation was really a sin though but I tuned into one of your lies late at night one night in
my bed and it was like the first thing you said and I was like "Oh like okay I can be free from this this isn't
something I have to deal with." So I was free from that but then I had like the burden of telling him so as soon as I
told him I like felt something leave me even more just felt so freeing to tell him it wasn't until 24 until I received
freedom from masturbation the few months before that like it was a struggle for me like I would go a while and then I
would backslide and then it was so like it was a battle back and forth i like knew something was holding him back i
could feel it when he was struggling with the masturbation and the pornography but I didn't know what it
was there was like something between us like I knew that he loved me and wanted
to be on fire for Jesus like I knew that i was like what is missing you know I remember you saying that you had tried
to tell her so many times yes but there was literal bondage i couldn't make the
words it literally just silenced my tongue and then once I sewed it was easy came right out and like when he told me
I was like "Oh this is it." Like this was it
[Music] welcome to the Revival is Now podcast i
am so excited for what God has in store i know he's going to move in power through his word through his spirit
through his anointing and miracles are going to happen and I believe freedom and healing will take place through the
screen and I believe you will be blessed i am so excited to have 5F Church family
here we have Kelly and Pat from Pennsylvania
area so welcome i'm so blessed to have you on my podcast and I'm so excited for
the people watching and listening to hear your story you have an amazing testimony both of you thanks for having
us thank you for having us such an honor to be here oh glory to God well
let's start from the beginning i know that
Kelly you found 5F Church is that right yeah yeah that was in January 2022
and um you came up uh just you preaching in the park a quick video and I was like
who is that like that girl is on fire and I I just like just my spirit just
like jumped inside of me because I had been a Christian since 2019 i had an
encounter with Jesus and I was super oppressed and um I was just living very
rebellious and Jesus like I I prayed on my knees for the first time and I was
actually like manifesting in my bed and I was delivered in my in my bedroom of
mostly everything but um one yoke that I wasn't delivered of until 5F but so I
knew that demons were real in 2019 but I had never seen anyone casting them out or anything um I didn't see it in the
church no one really talked about it it was kind of but like I knew they were real um so then when I came I was just
like a little bit confused like where is like I know demons are real but like
what I don't I didn't know like what to do about it as far as like who to follow and who to listen to about it until I
saw you the one minute clip of you in the park and then I went to your page and I saw the deliverances and I was
like wow like this this is like what I know is true like what I experienced in
my bedroom with with manifesting and being delivered and not like cuz I was
hearing voices and then I didn't hear them anymore so I knew demons were real and to see you to find you was such a
relief it was so amazing it was like I just was like I found what I was looking
for that I didn't know I was looking for um so that was January 2022
and um we had been married for
um like a little bit under a year and um
I was we were having uh miscarriages back to back and then when the month
that I found you was the same month that we got pregnant and I actually was able to hold the baby and um yeah so That was
that was January 2022 and it just automatically started out as as a huge blessing wow hallelujah praise God
praise God and you have two children now praise God and so what happened once you
found 5F Church and once you started watching online yeah so immediately like I started feeling like healing to my
body like just like the pregnancy was going smooth and everything and I just was like just feeling good like feeling
like I had no desire to drink alcohol anymore which it kind of was a little bit of a desire but it totally went away
so like I felt like my health was getting like better but um I still
struggled with um masturbation and that was like the one thing that I
was not delivered of in 2019 when Jesus like delivered me of a lot of like
addictions and anxiety depression but that was the one yoke I still had and
like not much growth not much transformation um just kind of staying stuck and um I
would tune into your lives sometimes i wasn't like fully committed or anything just like here and there but I
was receiving so much even just tuning in and coming like just being open to
receiving and listening to what you had to say about deliverance and Jesus and his power and um yeah so after a few
months of like seeking Jesus through you and and 5F I that that yoke of
masturbation just fell off praise God yeah yeah it was so amazing i finally
had strength to resist and the desire went away um but I dealt with bondage
with him not knowing about it and I it was So this is after you were set free
you still Yeah felt like bondage yeah it wasn't total honest
yeah because I wanted him to know everything and like my testimony and I knew like cuz I I wasn't sure if
masturbation was really a sin though because it doesn't really say it explicitly in the Bible but I tuned into
one of your lives late at night one night in my bed and you like it was like the first thing you said like you were
like yeah blah blah blah like this is in the masturbation and I was like oh like okay if this is like I can I can be free
from this this isn't something I have to deal with um this is not my portion for
those listening and watching just so you can know why it is a sin is because
sexual pleasure is created by God in the confines of marriage it's
supposed to be just in marriage it's a gift from God in marriage and nowhere
else is it supposed to be when we take sexual pleasure um if you engage open
doors seek after sexual pleasure in any other way besides a man and a woman in
marriage it's an open door for demons to come because God didn't create sex for
that only for marriage between a man and a wife and so to to touch yourself
sexually for sexual pleasure that is outside of man and wife um husband and
wife marriage how God created it and so that's why it is a sin
so I was free from that but then I had like the the burden of telling him and I
just knew that God wanted me to tell him and I actually ended up telling him um
on our one-year anniversary right before we went out to dinner i was like I'm telling him like it's like I just felt
so comfortable with him as it was like I like I was like I can tell him i know it'll be fine so as soon as I told him I
like felt like like something leave me even more like I don't know if it was just like the burden or like I don't
know but it just felt so freeing to tell him and he just like hugged me and and
just like was just so accepting and warming about it and that was it like
that was that was that and then I just went on and kept receiving and and
getting more strength and um and yeah just just being so equipped from the
teachings and that was the summer of 2022 but we still weren't fully planted
yet so we were still tuning in like here and there so he was um he wasn't like
receiving as much as I was at at this point in 2022 gotcha yeah so it was like
me kind of first and then showing him um your teachings and I didn't really take
it seriously even in the beginning either so that took more surrendering and as time went on
but I want I want to hear your story so
so um I remember when like as she was just talking about when she found you
she showed me and like I had so I had become I like so I was saved August
was that 22 no 21 no 2020 you were you became a Christian before we got married
2020 and um I was
I was off in the world like I was I went from u major drug addiction went through
rehab came out of that whole thing and then was drinking for years very heavily
so one night uh I heard voices
like demonic tongues literally demonic tongues and this is right after me and her talking
so I called her the next day and I said "I got to know more about Jesus."
So that's what started my journey with Jesus and so anyways fast forward um
right so there was only the one time I ever heard voices and I I yelled out to Jesus i said "In Jesus name leave." And
then it went quiet so we knew demons were real mhm like before the anointing
uhhuh so and I was like really seeking for like truth like there's a whole year up before all this so like God knew like
I was looking for him truly because he is the truth right so after all this
um we went to other churches and stuff we weren't wasn't finding what we what
God wanted us for right so after Kelly found you I was like "Yeah okay." Like
"I'll I'll check her out." And um I forget what happened exactly like it
it went on for a few months she would tune in and she'd be like "Hey you want to watch with me?" And I would watch
here and there we were just kind of quiet yeah very quiet about everything but I still I didn't know like any
better so um 23 is when I really started taking
everything much more serious like the end of 22 into 23 no no just 23 uhhuh
and then um it wasn't until
it wasn't until 24 until I received freedom from masturbation
and like the amount of opportunities God gave me to confess to Kelly like what up
my secret sin and like the pornography that I was watching like it the amount
of times it's so anyways um I sewed
one one day I was watch I was at work it was during the week so it was one of your it was one of your older um
podcasts I forget which one it was but I was like you know what I'm going to sew a seed that I'm gonna uh have the
courage to tell Kelly seowing with the intention yes understanding the principle of sewing yes that when you
sew you reap and sometimes it's a key that unlocks your freedom just because when you sew into God's kingdom you will
always receive more sometimes it's financial provision you're receiving sometimes it's miracles deliverance
sometimes it's something spiritual that takes place something different but
every single time you will receive so you saw that principle is that right yes
yes you your eyes opened up to that principle yeah so like I'm I remember seeing somebody that you had on uh it
was a Sunday service and they swed and received freedom and um I'm like worked
for them it's going to work for me so I did it and I don't remember if it was that day exactly but it was like the
either that day or the next day I got home from work i was going to tell her over the phone and I was like I can't do this i got to do her in person soon as I
got home it was the first words out of my mouth when I stepped out of the truck and I was like so told her and like she
said before it was like a weight that fell off of me and up in before that so
that was in June uh June of 24 last year um is when I told her was it it was June
right mhm and the few months before that like it was a struggle for me like I
would go a while and then I would backslide and then it was so like it was a battle
back and forth i remember you saying that you had tried to tell her so many times yes but there was literal bondage
i couldn't make the words so like it was it was and I So couldn't make the words
so many times and then once I sewed it was like it was easy came right out wow
it was incredible so that was the key that unlocked your deliverance in that area yes and in my book Unlock Your
Deliverance I talk about different keys there's are different keys that unlock your freedom complete freedom it's
different for everybody some people just need one key some people need two keys some people need three keys one of these
keys is sewing and you know just for this type of oppression that you had in
this this area that was your key you know it wasn't the key for you Kelly you
were able to tell him but without sewing but it was the key for you that was the
key that unlocked that specific chain and you know that's what I I talk about
in my book like if there's this one area where you are stuck and you've tried all
the other keys you know like you're surrendered completely to Jesus you are planted in a church where God's power is
at you are keeping all the doors shut to the devil you are resisting the devil continually and confessing the truth of
God's word and you you're you're renouncing and you're positioning yourself where God's power is and
there's this one area where you are not seeing breakthrough it's an indicator that that key of sewing may be the key
that will unlock your deliverance for that particular bondage
and so wow that's so amazing you you sewed and it was immediate yeah yeah it
was it was within about a day I I would say if I remember correctly somewhere around there wow yeah it was it was
incredible and she had already told you yes that she but still you weren't able
to that's how you know it's bondage because you you knew that she wouldn't judge you mhm right yes like you knew
but there was bondage just holding you back couldn't make the words for whatever that bondage was that was
holding on to me like this literally just silenced my tongue wow so then like backing up too like when she first
introduced me to you I was skeptical because I was like "Yeah like huh I
don't know." Like cuz I I was kind of like "You're a woman." Like I don't I don't know like the Bible tells us you
know but in uh scripture you know interpret it wrongly like that you know not the right revelation on that in
context but anyways um it wasn't even like old wine cuz I didn't I I haven't
been a Christian my whole life i was Catholic but like didn't pay attention to anything but I I knew Jesus like I
knew of him but anyways um I the more I watched you and listened to what you
were talking about I was like "Okay like I get it i got it now this is" and then
something happened where I had God gave me revelation that there is no
male and female in the spiritual realm so like I was like "Okay I got it now i get it now." So that's from scripture
yeah there's no longer slave free or slave there's no longer male or female
yes we are all one mhm yes and the Holy Spirit can move through male and female
equally he's not held back by a gender by a woman he can move just as
powerfully yes to heal deliver preach lead
hallelujah yes go on and I just saw like ended up seeing like how how pure you
are are and I was like yes we're definitely being fully planted here and
then ever since we became fully planted too like a lot of things just became easy in life like I mean I wouldn't say
like you know it was all a walk in the park but like for the most part like it was it was fairly like it's been it's it
just gets better it's gotten really good so yeah but that was major the major
bondage that I had was the masturbation and pornography and I remember you had said I think you had said in the past I
think I heard this that when you sewed you were able to tell her and simultaneously you were also free right
is that right the masturbation and watching pornography yeah so before I told her it was like it was sporadic
when I would when I would backslide and then I would go a while fine and I'm
like okay yes I I am free but I I didn't listen either I didn't listen to the
equipping or it was also a combination of you know still being in bondage like
that um and then after that uh the devil tried to send me lies twice and I
listened to them in two areas and um
talked about it with her again and then after Dallas flourish
it was major breakthrough dallas flourish changed my life for forever
praise God yes yeah god really spoke like the first sentence you said Friday
night it was incredible you just said like God is Jesus is is in you and he's with you and I took that and understood
it as therefore I can no longer sin because he is in me so praise God like
he just he really opened my eyes spiritually to to that principle right there so after that conference you're
able to live really in purity and no thoughts like I used to my mind used to
be so scattered where I would daydream just so random like all the time and
that doesn't happen anymore praise God yes yes wow so you know you live across
the country we're in LA right now you're planted from afar you're planted from
Pennsylvania yes and so you're tuning in on the Sundays and Sunday services and the live streams throughout the week and
um but you come sometimes to events such as the Flourish Conference Dallas yes
and so that that shows its power it's very important to come in person at
times even though you're receiving online things really changed in a new way for you when you came in person yeah
100% is that what you found for pretty much most or every time you've come in
person every time I've come in person I've walked away with some kind of a major change
hallelujah hallelujah and like a lot of a lot of the videos too that I've I've never
manifested like that mhm so however it was for me however everything was was
just nice and slow and like I guess God knew that I needed to take things slow I
guess mhm but um yeah like a lot of videos were repeat like replays where
you received from yes yeah and like some of them I I'd listen to like because I
remember watching a couple testimonies of Austin um and he was like I watch I you know I
listen to these um multiple times a week or something so I was like I'm going to start doing that so like that ended up
helping me with um how to maintain your fire 115 episode
mhm and like that no more condemnation after that one
praise God yeah like so it was it's it's been incredible hallelujah
praise God we are gonna link that episode in this post so people can watch
that too yes be blessed hallelujah praise God and I want to just ask you
just as a as a married couple like have you seen transformation in your marriage
at all oh yeah yeah yes it felt like when like it felt like I like knew
something was holding him back i could feel it when he was struggling with the masturbation and the pornography but I
didn't know what it was and um it just kind of like was confusing and
like I knew that he loved me and wanted to be on fire for Jesus like I knew that but it did there
was just something that I was like "What is missing?" You know there's just something's missing and like when he
told me I was like "Oh this is it." Like this was it so now we're really like And
before that it felt like there was I wouldn't say tension but there was like something between us yeah like the
spiritual spouse there was definitely a spiritual spouse that I had yeah because those come through masturbation yes and
watching porn that's an open door for spiritual spouses and that's why it's important to not masturbate why that's a
sin because any anytime you're opening up a door sexually outside of the confines of marriage where God created
it you're opening up the door to spiritual spouses which is where a demon comes in and like claims you as their
spouse and what hap how that how that manifests in your life is that you will
find a disconnect in marriage you'll find um honestly the demon being jealous
you you you can feel distant and um division and not know why or have you
know negative thoughts towards your spouse and not know why like for no reason and that's a demon influencing
coming in between the marriage um and so
wow you were free of those as well praise God and so you so you felt just
so much more united we we feel so much we are so much closer and united and
like we can like it's real fellowship and like we're just on the same page with everything and it's just so much
more peaceful and we're on fire together it's not like me trying to pull him like
come be on fire like me or you know like why aren't you doing this now like the
level of patience now that we both have that's probably due to the kids too
yeah but yeah we just like I think that was the biggest struggle for me was
trying to like push him but not be forceful but like be like why aren't you
like doing what I'm doing and like aren't you free like you know it just like it was like questions like I felt
so free and I just I could feel that he wasn't fully free but I didn't know what it was so now that like we truly are
like we're naked before God and to each other and that is such an amazing
feeling it's so amazing that is a really incredible and even like when he messed up a few times like he told me and and
we were able to work on it together and you know just we can be we're just
totally comfortable with each other now and open about it and we can grow together i was just going to say I keep
seeing one that you are one i was just going to say that before you said that I see you are one and this is how God
created marriage and it's so beautiful and two is greater than one and I'm really
seeing like it's like you are the same like it's like almost like a duplication
you know like it's seen double it's like seeing on fire and purity and beautiful hearts for Jesus two together it's like
the same beautiful Yeah it's
Hallelujah hallelujah i'm so proud of you i'm so proud of you both just for
your surrender to Jesus and being leaders in God's revival just simply by
seeking him seeking Jesus in his fullness saying no to fear of man and the spirit
of religion and making that sacrifice that comes with that the sacrifice of
going through persecution that we all go through i'm so proud of you for being
true disciples of Jesus and being warriors in God's revival army i know
God is speaking right now to many couples out there to many men um and I

greater and I knew I was going to see it and applying the principles that you've
taught us and just doing that rejecting the lies

don't get hung up on that move on and like if I if I had given up I don't know
