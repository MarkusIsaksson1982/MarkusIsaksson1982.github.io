so today we're going to be learning more of how to maintain your deliverance
this is part three for the past two weeks we've been
learning in depth this very important topic one of the most important
teachings topics that you need to learn that you need to know to have victory over the devil and keep your freedom
you've received and go glory to glory and all of you need to return to these teachings too these are so important to
return to listen again meditate on them remind yourself amen
all right so today I just want to recap so far
of the the points that we've learned of how to maintain our freedom
so to recap you need to value and remember your deliverance and value
Jesus your deliverer Jesus your lord value what he's done for you don't forget it you need to surrender your
whole life every part of your life every part of your heart to Jesus you need to shut doors in the spiritual
realm shut doors that stayed open until you were free because you couldn't close them on your own
because you needed deliverance and also other doors that maybe you were lazy about shutting all the doors in your
spiritual life you have to shut because those are the ways that the devil will come back in where he has legal access
then you need to fill yourself with the Holy Spirit and there's different
parts of that such as your relationship with God reading his word being in his
word meditating on his word intimacy with God and being filled with the anointing of
God in order to be filled with the anointing of God you must stay connected to where
the power of God is moving be planted at a church where God's calling you to be planted at be truly planted not just dip
in here and there whenever you feel like it but be truly planted so that anointing continually come upon your
life and fill you that's part of the feeling being filled um so that's the recap to refresh you to
remind you where we left off and so
this next part is in First Peter 4 12.
it says dear friends do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to
test you as though something strange were happening to you but rejoice in as much as you
participate in the sufferings of Christ so that you may be overjoyed when his
glory is revealed so this scripture is telling us that we
should not be surprised we should not be taken aback when attacks come when the
devil attacks we are in a spiritual war Bible 101 what it means to be a
Christian 101 we are in a spiritual war we can't escape that it's part of our
life here on this Earth spiritual war we are in every day
so it says uh it says in Ephesians 6 12 we wrestle not against flesh and blood
but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual
wickedness in high places so it says do not be surprised at this
attack in the spiritual warm realm this war in the spiritual realm do not be surprised
so in other words what that also is saying is be aware be expectant of this
if you're not aware and expectant of this you're not living in the spirit
and you will be blinded when the Devil Comes you won't be aware your eyes won't be opened up to when he comes and you
won't have Victory you'll lose the war and so when it comes to maintaining maintaining your deliverance this is so
important that we understand we're in a spiritual war we have to be aware as the
Bible says be aware be vigilant for the the devil is roaring around like a lion
seeking whom he can devour we gotta take it seriously that scripture we had to take it
seriously These Warnings that the word of God's given us and we have to know that when when you
are set free the devil is so angry
he's extra angry in this season we're in right now in the year 2023 because for so long
so much of the body of Christ most of the body of Christ did not know it was possible to be set free
and now the words getting out the words getting out without Hallelujah
[Applause] the words getting out with every person
every next person that be that is being set free the words getting out by their
testimony so every time God sees somebody be delivered he is fuming
there's there's pretty much nothing more that makes him so angry
because to walk in Abundant Life which means you're free and you're receiving
the reward that Jesus has given us the world he's receiving the reward of
his suffering we are walking in this inheritance we are walking glory to glory Abundant Life
that makes the devil the most mad because that's when God's glory is revealed the most and that is that's how
we can be the brightest lights show how amazing Jesus is to the world
that's why the devil hates it so bad it shames his kingdom like nothing else
it opens up eyes people's eyes this is what's going on the devil is exposed
so what's happening when Deliverance takes place is like the devil is exposed the devil is exposed and the devil is
furious he's Furious so what his aim his strategy is to try to
steal your deliverance that you have received that is his strategy so it is
wise for you to understand this when you're coming to receive Deliverance for the first time when you're continually
receiving layers upon layers of Deliverance when you've been set free for a while
you must know this he wants to steal your deliverance he wants to take it
so you have to be on guard in the spiritual realm of this first of all you need to know that this
is yours he cannot take it unless you give him the power to take it by
believing his lies
so when you're delivered or when you're about to be delivered like some of you are coming here for the first time
um when you're about to be delivered this is so important for you to be aware of this that this is not like
a clinic a hospital it's not like I'm coming to get uh a procedure I'm
coming to get a medicine this is going to fix me it's just going to be heal me and that's that
this is not how it works you receive deliverance and healing by
your faith by your faith in Jesus that he is your healer and your
deliverer you keep your deliverance and your healing by your surrender to Jesus your faith in
him as your lord and your faith in
the word of God believing the word of God believing
that God's speaking through the word and and putting the word into action
the Bible says faith without works is dead
faith without works is dead so to receive as I said receiving healing and deliverance isn't like I'm going to
receive this surgery this procedure and that's that I leave there and then I don't do anything I'm just fixed
no you have to play a part in this you have to take action
you you have to come with faith you have to come with faith to receive your healing and your deliverance that's
on you and when you leave this place you have to apply your faith you have to keep
walking in faith you have to believe when the word of God all these instructions the word of God
is saying the Rhema word of God that I am releasing to you the present tense word of God you have
to have faith in it and apply it faith without works is dead so if you're not applying what what
you're receiving this Faith well yes I believe God can deliver I believe in his
word but you have to apply his word
or else the healing and deliverance will be dead [Applause] faith without works is dead faith in
healing and deliverance and keeping your healing and deliverance and walking an abundant life you need faith for this
and active faith faith in action do what the word of God is saying do what I am
telling you these instructions from God that you're hearing take it seriously
yes that's how you'll receive your healing and deliverance and keep it
but people coming here that are just wanting a quick fix treating it like a hospital
dipping in going out and saying not having the intention to come back not having the intention to surrender their
whole life to God leaving and looking like well did it work let's see if it worked now
hmm I don't feel much better I guess it didn't work
they're not going to keep what they received many people have received Deliverance but they don't have faith or they don't
have faith in action and so they're not keeping what they've received because they're treating it like a quick
fix like not going in like the hospital not
going in the spirit of how to receive it and maintain it and keep it amen
Okay so the one of the biggest ways that the Devil Comes the way he attacks is
through lies that he sends in the mind and so this is where that spiritual war
is going to be in terms of fighting for fighting to
steal your deliverance okay be aware that's where it's going to be so be aware of your mind what's going
on in there be aware that the devil may try in a new way that you haven't encountered before in your mind with
these lies once you've been set free as the scheme to try to steal your deliverance so I'm going to go through
some of what these lies are that you need to be aware of so you can spot them
and you will not accept them amen number one lie that the devil could
bring is he will try to put lies in your mind sometimes in some people he works
differently in different people but for some people they're coming to receive deliverance and as they're you know
expecting to receive hungry to receive the devil can come right there and send
lies in their mind the devil's allowed to be moving upon
this Earth even in heaven when he when when the devil is ends up
asking God if he can take everything from job
and see if job will still worship God where did it happen in heaven
it wasn't like the devil was banned and he was on the earther in Hell or whatever and he beckoned God and God had
to leave the throne in heaven and come down to the Earth and talk to him no
he goes up in heaven the Bible says so in the same way just because you're
here in church doesn't mean that the devil might not try to come in your mind when you're here in the church
where the anointing's moving so you got to be aware of that I
remember a couple um a few weeks ago there was a gentleman who received
Deliverance he he was set free powerfully the power of God made him fall down to the ground and then he
testified that pain left his body afterwards but he testified right after and he shared that as he was in the
place of receiving Deliverance about to receive Deliverance the devil put lies in him saying
maybe these are actors and this person wasn't even like an atheist or a skeptic the people that
tend to think these these stupid things these nonsense ridiculous foolish things absurd things
they don't even make sense amen but no but he was a a Believer a good-hearted believer but the devil can
come in with any kind of lie the devil wants sometimes any kind of ridiculous thought
and so in that moment where he is standing here and God's about to touch him powerfully the devil is trying to
come in this way to try to stop him from believing to try to stop him from renouncing
but he had Victory he recognized it was a lie he wouldn't believe that lie and he renounced so powerfully with so
vulnerable and God set him free Hallelujah
amen so so number one lie of the devil can be
in the place of you you receiving your deliverance or right after you receive Deliverance even in the house of God
coming in with these lies like maybe this isn't real
absurd lies to try to keep you from receiving what you have from keeping what you've just received or what you're
about to receive in the spiritual Realm amen
so lie number two is this I don't think anything happened
I don't think I was set free I didn't feel anything
I didn't sense anything different I felt nothing physically and I'm seeing
other people feel so much I'm seeing other people
demons scream out of them I'm seeing other people weeping I'm seeing other people fall back I'm seeing other people
jump up and down screaming with joy I didn't feel any of
that so the devil will come and he will lie to you
after the service for example or in the middle of service and say you didn't receive you weren't set free
first of all you need to understand that Deliverance looks and feels and happens
different for everybody there's not a certain formula of how it should feel of
how it should look it's not like we need to see you coughing to make sure demons came out of
there we need to see you screaming or coughing or fall back with a power that's how we know otherwise we better
keep praying no no no that's that's not how it works God moves
in the spiritual Realm sometimes it manifests to the physical
because it's so powerful what God's doing that that's why sometimes it's so
powerful that it immediately manifests to the Physical Realm sometimes people will literally feel
something lift off of them sometimes I remember this gentleman here yesterday I mean not
yesterday last Sunday I remember seeing you I remember seeing him when he was set free
supernaturally breathe so deep right it was like
like I can't even do that but it was like something Supernatural was happening
inside of you something super it was you were opening up where you couldn't
open up before because there was bondage inside yeah
Hallelujah praise God
um and so sometimes you really do feel sometimes there's all these physical
manifestations but sometimes there is not actually a lot of times there is not
there's no feeling there's no manifestation but you've been free just as much as the big manifestation you
witnessed you saw you heard from somebody else you've been free just as much
because what's happening the Deliverance this is a spiritual matter
and the spiritual realm is is the Unseen Realm just just as like God is here 100
I mean he's here just as much as I'm I'm for sure here right now right nobody's
dreaming this up we know I'm here I'm standing here on this stage
at 300 South Mission Road Los Angeles California at fivefold church
I'm standing here on June 18th on fathers I am here you're not 99 sure about that you're 100
sure right you see me but we don't see God like you're seeing
me right now we're not hearing God's Audible Voice like you're hearing me right now but he is 100 just as much here right
now as you see me not 99 we should be 100 sure of this
amen and so this is how it works in the spiritual realm God is a spirit these things Deliverance healing is spiritual
and so don't expect to feel something don't expect the manifestation if that
happens cool great awesome but you shouldn't be looking for it you
shouldn't be measuring what you think what you've received by what you feel
that's not being spiritual and I know it happens a lot here we see
a lot of physical manifestations here don't let that cloud your vision in the
spiritual Realm of the of the of how really things are working it's not to be measured by the physical manifestations
at all amen [Applause]
so I mean it's it's why it's wise to
we read the word of God we see how God moved in power the people would position
themselves where God's power is moving like under the shadow of apostle Peter they recognize this is a true Apostle of
God this is truly God's power moving this is God's kingdom it's his kingdom
government and his way for us to receive for us to receive healing Deliverance is
to come come to the house of God come to the church where his power is being released instantly position ourselves
there when we position ourselves there that's all we need the anointing is for sure going to hit us as long as we have
faith as long as we're serious about serving God's surrendering God's for sure gonna hit me he's for
sure gonna do something in my spiritual life it's wise to have that kind of faith
that's the kind of Faith where you for sure will be touched by his power when you come to where he truly is
it's a principle in the spiritual realm if you come with this right kind of faith not simply God exists I believe in
God not just that Faith the faith that Jesus is your healer and deliverer the faith
that this is how God moves in power by his anointing through vessels you position yourself where God is moving in
power I know I'm going to be touched by God here God is going to touch you it's a principle in the spiritual Realm
amen you're going to receive whatever is you need no doubts Hallelujah is anybody with me
today Hallelujah
I want to make sure you're not sleeping here this is important Hallelujah this is very very important
praise God so we see we see in the story of
Luke 17 11.
so Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee as he was going into
a village 10 men who had leprosy met him they stood at a distance and called out in a loud voice Jesus Master have pity
on us when he saw them he said go show yourselves to the priests and as they went they were cleansed or they were
healed one of them when he saw he was healed came back came back praising God in a
loud voice he threw himself at Jesus's feet and thanked him and he was a Samaritan
um and so and also it says Jesus asked we're not all 10 cleansed we're the other nine as
no one returned to give praise to God except this Foreigner then he said to him rise and go your faith has made you
well Hallelujah
so this is powerful so so these people with Leprosy came to Jesus Jesus had
pity on us he us we believe you can heal us and what does Jesus say he says go
show yourselves to the priests so basically they came in the presence of Jesus Jesus released his anointing upon
them to heal them to free them to touch them and so they had received in the
spiritual realm right there when they came in the presence of the anointed one they have received
they've received in this spiritual Realm which is what's important
and it will manifest into the Physical Realm but we need to go in the spirit to receive what we want to receive to
receive the healing to receive the freedom so the important thing it was done it was in the spiritual realm now
it was a matter of time to see it manifest but it for sure was already done amen
and so Jesus says show yourselves to the priests so they you know they in obedience and
they with faith you know they weren't like but Jesus I don't see the leprosy
gone yet maybe you should pray again I didn't feel anything I didn't fall
back I look the same I feel the same it didn't work they didn't do that
they had faith that they really had received and so they walked in their faith and
obedience they did what Jesus said and the Bible says on their way they were cleansed on their way they were healed
so that's equivalent to you coming here Jesus is here Jesus the
Healer and deliver is here you're coming here to receive healing and deliverance from your Jesus and you're coming here have pity on me
Jesus have pity on Me Lord he releases the anointing to you but you don't feel or you don't feel any
different but you leave that place you leave the church you go home
at first you see no difference you walk outside you look in the sun I see no difference I feel nothing different
but you believe that you really have received so you just trust you have this
spiritual knowledge that things aren't always instant the manifesting from the spirit to the physical that's not always
instant sometimes it is but many times it is not you have this spiritual knowledge
and so you go home you don't listen to any lies of the devil
because you know you're in that spiritual war you're expectant for these lies you have victory over these lies
and you eventually notice the leprosy is gone the sickness is gone
the bondage is gone on your way you are healed you are freed
and so it's not being spiritual to analyze everything in your body did it
work like in the church or as immediately after you leave the church it's not spiritual to be analyzing like
let me see did it work but the spiritual thing to do I mean you
can check yeah be expectant but just know you don't know when it's going to manifest
it could manifest instantly so you should check but you need to it's being spiritual to know the word has been
declared the anointing has been released I believe in the power of God that's
here I believe in all the testimonies uncountable testimonies that I've heard
I bet most of you haven't even heard even half the testimonies that even have
been released because there's so many there's hundreds online on on my YouTube
of them you need to believe in the testimonies you need to believe that the power of
God is real here and so come here come with that faith and know I am gonna receive today
if it's healing you need I'm gonna receive healing if it's Freedom you need I'm gonna receive Freedom if it's a
baptism Holy Spirit I'm going to receive the baptism of Holy Spirit if it's just whatever God wants to do more of God
you've got to receive more of God you're gonna see more anointing more of his spirit you need to come with that kind of faith
that kind of expectancy and then after the words have been declared after the anointing has been released You You You
Believe in the power here you've even seen evidence upon evidence the way people are rejoice in the way the power
of God's moving you know whoa that that I see I know for sure I've received that
like the same thing that they've received and I can see it I've received that too
and so you you you should leave this place I mean actually before we leave this
place I like to many times have you all stay together as a reminder
that you have been healed you have been freed you have been you have received the anointing and so many times we will
say this and especially the Revival is now events because for many of you you know a lot of these things but for the
Revival events I have to really make sure you have received you know
don't think you haven't received you've received don't let the devil still what is it what God's given you it's
it's very urgent and the Revival's not offense I'm I don't want the devil to play with God's people amen
but many times here too I'll have you say repeat after me I am healed I am
freed I am anointed there's power in your confession
there's power in declaring using your Authority this is what I believe this is what I
have received and so this is how the devil knows ah I can't come here
I can't bombard them with lies as much as much because they've spoken this
but if you don't speak it if you're like I don't know we'll see the devil's
already having more authority to come in your mind with lies
so you need to start out declaring I have been free I have been healed I am
anointed and then after you leave this place you need to continually speak this
every day renew your mind I've been free thank you Jesus for freeing me don't wait till you've seen
it don't wait till you felt it don't wait till you've seen the manifestation physically declare it
because sometimes as we heard in this story with the people with Leprosy things take time the anointing sometimes
works like medicine just like how we see many times people laying on the stage for a long time and
others not why because God moves differently he chooses to move in power
differently so these people laying on stage for a long time many usually they
can't get up the power of God has made them like unconscious or partly unconscious
and made them unable to move for a Time so that he can do a spiritual surgery a
deep spiritual work in them because with Adam to make this great
great big work of the creation of Eve God had to put Adam to sleep
Adam wasn't walking around while doing things well God took out a rib
and made Eve so when God needs to do a deep spiritual work that means it's not as immediate
it means he he might put you to sleep and do a spiritual surgery
but not for everybody it's different for everybody so in the same way some people's Deliverance is immediate they
felt something leave them and all of a sudden those constant bombarding lies are gone the craving they had the
addiction uh craving that they came in the church building with Advantage from their mouth like that I
need to have a cigarette it left them as they were free
Hallelujah sometimes the spirit of infirmity the
Demonic spirit is causing all this physical pain in a body and sickness sometimes a person will be free and
immediately all the Pain's gone all the symptoms this the sickness feelings it's
gone immediately sometimes it is immediately but sometimes it is not
sometimes the way God is choosing to move is how we chose to move with the lepers
on their way not immediately the anointing working as medicine
amen
so lie number three just to be aware of that the Devil comes
in some people's head at some people's head is sometimes the devil can lie and say it was all in your head
it wasn't real it didn't really happen it was just your emotions
that's a lie from the devil you know what you experienced you know what you experience in that moment so you need to
when you experience something so powerful from God you need to Value it you need to remember it you need to
intentionally bring it to remembrance this was real this happened you need to be aware the devil's gonna this was so
powerful what God did this devil might try to come back with a lie saying it didn't really happen it was in your head because the devil's so desperate
and then another lie that the devil will come try to come in with is
that it's come back the the demons have come back
now that can be true sometimes that's not a lie because you've opened up doors because you haven't taken it seriously
maintaining your deliverance that can be true but for many times this
is a big scheme of the devil that he'll come in he'll try to come with is you've been
freed and he will bring back lies he will bring back symptoms
like the same symptoms that you had before if you had insomnia before and you were freed and you're sleeping
wonderfully now all of a sudden a week later a month later two months later maybe out of nowhere
you're not sleeping through the night all of a sudden
your mind's been clear free of Suicidal Thoughts free of depression free of anxiety but a week later a month later a
couple months later out of nowhere you're hearing these familiar voices
again you've been freed of these demonic nightmares
these demonic sexual dreams but a week later a month later a couple months later maybe all of a sudden you
get this horrible nightmare you've been healed of the pain of the
sickness completely but a week later a month later a couple months later you'll feel pain the same pain you used
to have before the same symptoms of the sickness you used to have before many times these are lies from the Devil
remember that the word of God says don't be surprised by the fiery darts
don't be surprised by them as if it was some strange ordeal don't you know that
God is God is testing you it says do not be surprised that the
fiery ordeal that has come on to test you as though something strange were
happening to you so God this is a principle God uses some
attacks of the devil he allows those attacks just like he allowed the attack against job just like he allowed the
attack against David from Saul just like he allowed the attacks against Joseph
with his brothers God allows some attacks to come at you
for the purpose of testing you for the purpose of refining you so you can go to
the next level to go to the next level you have to pass tests
to be transformed more into the image of God you have to go through something difficult and pass that test
to be the champion you have to go through that fight that war that battle that race and
Win It and it's uncomfortable it's not fun sometimes but you have to go
through it and so when it comes to your deliverance you need to understand that you are
going to the next level now and God wants to keep taking you higher
and higher it's time to go higher so test time
test time it's test time beware of this anytime you go higher with God be ready
oh there's another test coming sometime I gotta be ready I'm going higher
so that God will allow the devil to come in this way
where it will be outward lies from the devil
outward I mean that by like when you have a demon it's inward
it's oppression inwardly and you can try to resist the devil but
he's not fleeing because you need the anointing to destroy the yoke
you need the anointing once when there's an inward demon it's the anointing that destroys the Yoke that's why so many
people try to fast and pray try to reject the devil a million times try to do all the right things Christian things
that God's telling you to do but nothing's happening no results why because it is the anointing that's
needed to make the demon go simple but then once you're free now you're
like every other believer who's free where you are in a spiritual war
and the way the Devil comes in the spiritual war is outwardly weapons formed against you but they don't Prosper if you don't allow them
weapons come as lies but they're outward and if you do the right spiritual uh principle the right
spiritual Act of what God's calling you to do those weapons won't prosper
and the devil has to flee he can't come in and you win you have Victory that's how it works in the spiritual Realm
so before when you were unbondage the the the insomnia was bondage you were
stuck with it it was real the anxiety the depression the Suicidal
Thoughts was bondage it was real it was something you had to live with every day
no matter what you did no matter how many times you tried to reject the devil you were stuck it was real demons were
within you were in bondage this sickness the the pain that was
caused by the Demonic oppression was real you were stuck with it it was bondage demons from within but now once
you are free Devil comes in this familiar way
insomnia maybe the thoughts uh Suicidal Thoughts depression anxiety
sickness but this time it's not inward it's not Demons Inside you are not in
bondage this time anymore it is it is a devil coming outwardly
which means you have the power to resist him and those weapons formed
against you won't prosper meaning yes you feel this familiar symptoms but you can stop it right now
this is not something that continues yes you're feeling the uncomfortability the the uncomfortability of that scary
weapon coming towards you but it's not lasting it's uncomfortable
for a second but you go to battle and you have Victory and it's done and you continue to live the free life that you
truly have been given from Jesus
so yeah that was annoying to deal with that one night you couldn't sleep with those thoughts that came to you out of nowhere
but you go to battle you resist the devil and it's done
you continue walking in your freedom you go to glory to glory and you pass the test and you go higher
amen so this is the spiritual principle of how to make sure the weapons don't
Prosper stop the weapons from prospering and how to have Victory how to keep your freedom
the Bible says in James 4 7 submit to the authority of God
resist the devil and he will flee from you
submit to the authority of God submit to the truth of his word
submit to it by believing in it by holding onto it by meditating on it by speaking it by choosing to believe in it
not just when you feel like believing it choosing to believe in it and the Rhema word of God the word of
God that you're here and here today that God has sent for you choose to value
that word so much maybe you if you need to you listen to this message every day for a while you do what you have to do
to Value it to meditate on it to get it in you submit to God
submit your whole self to God that means his word his logos word his Rhema word
the Rhema means present tense word of God today submit and so once you're submitted oh the word
of God is your truth it's firm in you now you have the
strength and power and wisdom to resist the devil diverse says submit to God
resist the devil and he will flee from you so you submit to God now you need to
resist him you resist him by speaking words out loud
because the power of life and death is in your tongue and we are given
Authority on this Earth we have authority over the devil and so that means that when he comes
with his lies we have authority over him we need to use it put him in his place
so those weapons come against you he's like I'm gonna send a weapon towards you hoping you'll believe it but you say ah
you do not have the authority to send a weapon at me it must not prosper from now it must die now that weapon
that's that's how it is in the spiritual realm this is how we need to see it in
the spiritual realm you have authority so once you're free you need to get serious about your Authority you need to
put the devil in his place like never before [Applause]
you you need to you need to how go in this transition when you were in bondage
it was different I told you the devil really did have a hold over you he really did
you were stuck he's laughing at us that we're in bondage
fasting and praying and try to resist in the Devil with the words and nothing's happening
but now you have been freed you've gone from bondage to complete
freedom [Applause]
someone who has a life sentence in jail who was locked in there locked
completely and then they are set free completely they can do whatever they want there are no chains around them
they are completely a free man or woman that is a night and day difference
amen this is how it is in the spiritual Realm
it is a night and day difference once you've been set free the devil had chains around you before
now he's under your foot upon him
Hallelujah [Music]
help get out stop on them stopped we take a pro as a prophetic ax Stomp
stop everybody as a prophetic Act sump on the devil
stomp on him right now say I am free
there's no more chains devil
you're under my foot those of you online get up and do this
too Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
you can have a seat now seriously in the spiritual realm the
devil is trying to trick you into thinking that you don't have authority over him
with his lies with his lies coming in your mind so you get out of prison
so if I if I'm in prison now now I'm free
[Applause] but then what happens is the Devil comes
in your mind and says you're not really free you need to go back into prison because you're in bondage now and you
need to keep you need you need more Deliverance you need to keep seeking more Deliverance you're in bondage you're in bondage
you're still in bondage you need more and you end up back here
you end up back here because of the devil's lies you believe them and you allowed him to lead you
you opened up more and more doors so he got his entanglement around you again
now many people do need layers of Deliverance many people need layer after layer of
Deliverance and it's not just a one-time thing but what's so important for you to understand is that once you've been set
free of one layer you need to realize you're set free from that prison
of that one thing
yeah instead of like I need so much more Deliverance how about I'm free
[Music] maybe there's other things there's there's still pain in the body there's
there's still problems in the marriage there's still other things that God's Gonna freely of you later but is that
not a big thing that you've been completely free of anxiety [Applause]
so you need to claim that freedom not just be waiting in the prison for the full reveal you have to claim that
Victory you have to execute your Authority start executing your Authority I am free
God's freed me of anxiety thank God for that one thing that he freed you from all the time
instead of coming I you know some people they're like they don't value what God's done
and they can be like yes so I'm free of this I don't have suicidal thoughts
anymore but I have this issue and this issue and this issue still but instead
instead be like [Applause]
and and I know God's Gonna Be freeing me of more things layer by layer I need freedom from this thing and this
thing and this thing too but I know God's gonna do it and I just can't keep rejoicing stop rejoicing of him freeing
me from the Suicidal Thoughts that's the action of stomping on the
devil you're valuing what God has done you're starting to walk in your Authority I'm a free woman I'm a free man I'm free from
this anxiety or I'm free from the suicidal thoughts and and this is how you start to learn how to live as a free
man or woman rather than a Slave get out of that slave mentality
so it's very important that instead of focusing on all the things that you still need freedom from you are giving
more attention to what God has done thanking him reminding yourself what he's done
that that's that's that will help you receive more and more and more and then there's some of you that have already
been free and especially like if you've been here for a while
you're free I mean
I don't mean even a really long time but the anointing is powerful and strong here
so you know if you've been here for like more than a half year a year and you
think you need Freedom Devil's lying to you you're free because this is one of the really big
ways that unless you haven't withheld something and unless you've withheld something you haven't surrendered all of
you yet then you could still need freedom but if you've really surrendered you're free this anointing is powerful
God is faithful um so one of this when we've seen this happen at faithful Church there's been
several here they've testified of it here that they've been freed of this paralyzing lie of the devil where the
devil will speak you're not free you're not free and he'll come in this way in a couple different ways he'll bring that
same symptom back that familiar symptom The Familiar uh thing you had when you
were in bondage he'll bring that back to your he'll bring that back and at the same time he'll speak in your mind you
aren't fully free from this you need more freedom and what he's trying to do is get you back in that prison and get
you he'll even he can even people make people fake manifest because he can come so strongly in the
lies that it takes over their body the lies become that strong not as a demon
possessing their body but they allow the lies because they don't know to take over even their body because the power
of our mind is so powerful as a man or woman thinketh so is he or she
so if you really believe these lies that the devil saying you're not free you'll end up looking like you're not free even
manifesting but not real manifestation and so how you defeat the Devil in this
is you thank God for your freedom continually you meditate that that freedom was real
you've seen the change in your life amen you understand this is a way the
Devil comes with these lies and you continually submit to God resist the devil and he must flee you resist him by
speaking I reject that lie I reject that lie that I haven't been freed I reject that lie
of anxiety I reject that live insomnia whatever it is I reject it I am free
God has freed me and make it a practice to thank God and worship him specifically for freeing you
amen [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah
I'm telling you this is one of the biggest ways that the Devil comes for people after they've been freed is with
this lie the lie that it came back you haven't really been freed
or you need to keep on receiving more and more freedom you're not all the way free yet when you are free
so be aware of this scheme of the devil you have Victory when you reject and
resist his lies because it's a principle that he must flee resist the devil and
he must flee also I want to mention that if you have been in bond if you
okay a person who lived a Christian Life and didn't go too much into darkness but
did open up some doors and they got some demonic bondage in their life the difference between that life versus a
life of someone who's gone really into the World opened up many doors to the
devil especially when if witchcraft is involved the difference between their
experience after being free is going to look very different a person that they
haven't been so much into the world as much haven't opened up so many doors haven't believed so many of the lot the
lies of the devil a person like that where maybe it's minimal bondage let's say and they've
lived a pretty decent Christian good life for the most part when they're set
free the battle is not going to be as intense in the mind because the devil doesn't have as much Authority what you
sow you reap so the more Authority you've given the devil earlier on in your life
there's a ripping that takes place you're free and you will receive complete Abundant
Life but it's like the it's like it's like the difference of living a Pure Life and
there's reward and living open up the door a lot and
there's not as much reward in the beginning yet and the devil thinks I have an easy
target they believe my lies for so long so I'm gonna try harder here
it's a different experience after it's usually more of a process where the devil will try to come with these lies
more and so if that's you if you lived so much into deep deeper into opening up
doors to the devil be aware of that that you that it might not be immediate where there's completely no lies at all
but it might be a battle you're you're going in every day resisting the devil
when you're free out of Egypt there's a space before you get to the
promised land and so what I'm saying is that space in between that Wilderness space
will look a little bit more of a more intense spiritual war for those who have been in deeper
bondage and deeper open doors in the past than the person who hasn't
both the process both a Wilderness to to step into the promised land which we can
call really seeing the manifestation of full Abundant Life in every area and really feeling peace and joy and feeling
feeling good all the time kinda you know like not having to deal with the lies of the devil bombarding your mind we'll say
that's the the Promised Land so there's a space between once you've been free so be aware of that if you
have been deep opening doors don't be surprised by the fiery Flames
coming your way you know what to do here we go battle time
I got the victory I'm putting the devil even more to shame
he can't have me he's defeated I'm rejecting his lies the next day he's
coming with the lies I reject the lies again the next day he's coming with the lies I reject the lies again Victory to
victory victory to Victory
it's not it's not always going to be comfortable it can be annoying hearing the lies sometime but you are going
Victory to Victory and with every Victory the lies diminish
with every with every Victory the lies have to diminish
with every Victory more peace more joy more Abundant Life in Jesus name amen
Hallelujah Hallelujah praise God while the Lord is leading me
to go really deep into this topic of maintaining your deliverance so I didn't prepare for this but we're
going to have a part four next week
but I'm so glad God has taken it in this direction because this is so important
for you to really get this in you for really for you to really get this meat you will all be completely equipped so
you must have victory over the devil you will all keep your freedom and walk
in Abundant Life and go glory to glory in Jesus name amen [Music]
amen Hallelujah Hallelujah
thank you Jesus I just want to declare over every one of you right now
all of these lies that have come your way from the Devil that that you didn't see them for what
they were before I expose them now may they be exposed now may your eyes open up in the spiritual
realm now more to see and discern the strategies the tricks the lies of the
devil and may you receive this anointing and walk in strength and power to have
victory over every attack of the devil that you would be able to resist every
weapon formed against you that none of them would prosper in Jesus name
I speak peace to your mind I speak freedom to your mind in Jesus name
and I declare you must maintain your freedom no devil
can take it no demon can come back I declare in Jesus name
and if you have received Freedom right now if you've already received Freedom some of you you've received Freedom
before if this is your first time maybe you haven't yet but if you've received Freedom here just declare right now I am
free and there's some of you right now that
this message convicted you touched you there was a certain area in your life that you started believing the devil's
lies that you lost that you weren't really free from this thing
so if that's you right now I want you to declare I am free of and then say what
that is I am free
I reject Every Lie of the devil
by his stripes I am healed I am free
I receive my freedom I claim my freedom
the devil is under my foot I have authority over him
[Applause] amen Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause]
thank you Jesus thank you Jesus so in summary
sometimes the freedom manifestation hasn't happened yet what do you do you still declare I am free you still think
God I am free you still reject the lives of the devil sometimes you've seen it manifest you've experienced it you've
experienced the real freedom and then the devil tries to come back with his lies what do you do the same thing
submitting to God resist the devil and he has to flee the same thing you meditate on what God has done for you
you thank him for what he's done for you you speak those lies must go specifically you speak out loud and you
declare the truth I am free of this thing and you thank God and you praise him for freeing of that thing you should
make it a practice every day to remember to thank you Lord for freeing me from this thing five years ago
amen Hallelujah Hallelujah
thank you Jesus thank you Father thank you Lord
this is a place of equipping here this is not a place just to receive Deliverance this is a place to be
equipped to receive your deliverance and walk in Abundant Life and go glory to
glory and be equipped to not just be someone who's receiving deliverance and healing and that's it and you're just
sitting on the church seats but be equipped to be a powerful anointed vessel of God
amen so to be a powerful vessel of God who
fulfills your purpose you need to take this seriously maintaining your freedom
so God can bring you from above the out of the deficit and Beyond
we gotta solidify that deficit out of the deficit place I'm not
going back amen Hallelujah
