what jesus is doing is so amazing amazing may we never take it for granted
and man we gotta pack this place out amen there's so many people in need and jesus is ready he's ready to do the
impossible hallelujah johnny do you want to come share what jesus did
last week so
johnny last week she's been delivered here before she was delivered from an orphan spirit july 4th it was so
powerful and then oh you have socks on it's muddy fall
it's okay it's okay and she's been coming back and she's been
receiving more and more deliverance because sometimes there's layers of deliverance that needs to happen um
especially when there's been witchcraft perhaps in your family or depending on how much you had engaged with the world
in your past life for different reasons there sometimes needs to be layers and layers of deliverance doesn't happen all
in one time um so she's been coming every week receiving more and more and more deliverance and there was there are keys
to receiving full deliverance and there was a key that was released a prophetic key that was released to
you and your in your friend um two weeks ago and you came obedient to that
prophetic word and so do you want to just share what happened share what that was the key and
what happened yeah um hallelujah jesus is here he doesn't love
me more than he loves you what he did for me he can do for you so just every single one of these
testimonies is just to remind you that jesus loves you that's right and he wants to give you
life abundantly so so um i i like when i first read the bible i
was like okay verbatim if it says that people have demons people have demons and i was like i was
open right and so i got my first really big deliverance and the first like i'm about to cry just thinking about it the
first time i had a really big um deliverance my body felt like empty
on the inside and people don't talk about that it's like you literally feel like when when
you're so entangled and you know these things i think they were very generational um it it's like you walk with it for so
long that it's kind of you and so you feel really empty on the inside and that's why jesus is not going to give
deliverance if you don't have the holy spirit and you don't have a close relationship with the holy spirit if i
did not have jesus and i received that deliverance i probably would have committed suicide
you know and so like you really need that light of christ because we don't know what we're walking with and when we
get those things taken out that emptiness needs to be filled with the light of christ so when i had my first deliverance what
was happening was the lord was strengthening me delivering me and then strengthening me until he got me to a
point where i just yielded to the holy spirit i said holy spirit i don't know what this thing is you need to reveal everything to you to
me because i have no clue and um and it was so
much witchcraft like i was like this isn't my fault everybody was like johnny why aren't you
delivered like this has to be your fault i'm like it's not um and so
and so one thing at a time the lord just showed me one thing at a time and so i came here and when apostle catherine
preaches it's not apostle catherine it's the holy spirit you know when we yield
to the holy spirit and when our our congregation and our ministry belongs to the holy spirit these are words from god
they are not is not just apostle catherine making stuff up in her head throwing stuff out here she's asking the
lord this is a praying woman she's asking the lord what do i tell my people you know she like so it's so when when
we were here we wanted to know the key because and i was receiving a lot of deliverance at home like y'all i was like thrashing
on my bed like it was crazy like my back was like and i was on the bed it was like two
o'clock in the morning it was crazy um and but i had one last big guy and so i came here eager and waiting for a word
from the lord and the lord told me and my friend it was a tithe it was a tithe i had to bring nana an offering because
apostle catherine taught us about the difference between tithes and offerings and stuff like that and i need to bring an
offering and we see this in the old testament right sins that you're not aware of sins from your family members
you bring your offerings you bring your offerings to the altar a god and and it it sends it's so spiritual the lord just
sees that and it the aroma pleases him it's like a delicious tasty snack and
he's like thank you for the snack i will give you freedom i love snacks like everything is just
like we want to make our father delicious treats because he does so much for us so um so i was like you know i i have to
ask the lord what to bring him and it's gotta hurt a little bit like an offering
it's gotta feel like your heart's breaking a little bit like lord this is my money
and that's why we bring money now in the old testament we were bringing calves right
and animals because that's where our worth is now all our hearts and our money it's everything our money is everything
now so that's why we need to bring we need to bring it okay and it's not we're not we're bringing it to apostle path
we're bringing it to god and so i threw my money my savings in that bit i'm like
jesus this is you i'm trusting you and um i was completely set free it was so
horrible i i had um it was in my neck and i was like i would just tweak all
the time i would even just walk past a um i would walk past a
alcohol dispensary and i would just like start to twitch like because it i
i the lord told me it was um like molek like it was so it was an old demon very
spiritual and it was witchcraft on my grandmother's side but um i was free i couldn't believe it
literally right now i keep on expecting to like tweak out but i'm not tweaking like i'm
free i'm free and so
i just want to share with y'all like when i got free my body felt literally empty like it felt like i was like oh my
body felt so weak so i was i i oh man i just had to cry out to the lord all week
this week and just trust that jesus is just gonna fill out all those parts that i was walking with that wasn't me that
wasn't him and listen to this mighty woman of god y'all need to learn to be obedient i don't know who this is for
but some of y'all are disobedient y'all don't know how to listen we need to learn how to listen we need to learn
submission y'all don't know how to take words of advice okay the lord corrects those he loves he
loves you and if you're doing something wrong he will tell you and just be like wow father you love me i will take that
advice okay so hallelujah your keys to deliverance they're coming today they're
coming always and the lord is with you always and he will build you up amen
hallelujah praise god wow jesus wow jesus wow amen
i wonder speechless i'm speechless jesus leaves us speechless amen
um that was one of the most precious inexplicable joy the bible talks about that god leads us we're filled with
and it we don't see him but we believe him and we are filled with an inexpressible
joy [Music]
and i was just i posted it on social media i don't know if you saw it yet i posted it last night but i posted a picture of a johnny
at the park underneath a tree like 100 feet away from our service and that's the verse that stuck out he
fills us with inexpressible she was expressing in every kind of way she couldn't know how to the joy that god
brought her she was running around the whole park and landed under a tree like a hundred
feet away from the congregation left her hands lifted kneel down to god
we're so blessed amen we're so blessed that jesus is coming in power and we get to experience him and witness that
week after week thank you lord hallelujah well wow prophetic anointing truly is flowing here because of johnny
you pretty much preached my sermon today it's even titled keys of deliverance and you said you're going to receive your
keys of deliverance so hallelujah wow jesus jesus jesus there there are
keys to deliverance yeah i'm for real now
yeah this is my message there are keys to receiving deliverance
there are keys how are the keys found by the prophetic anointing
why is most of the church dead these days why are most people
there are keys to receiving deliverance there are keys how are the keys found
by the prophetic anointing why is most of the church dead these days
why are most people most christians struggling
with demonic oppression in their lives still anxiety depression
suicidal thoughts sic sickness night terrors
poverty why are so many christians
not living an abundant life because there is not
the apostolic and prophetic ministry
where god releases the prophetic keys
needed for one to receive complete deliverance
and healing there are keys
there are keys let me tell you when we read the bible when we look at jesus's ministry
it wasn't a specific for releasing healing and deliverance he
wasn't doing the same thing all the time now jesus is so powerful it seems like
he could just be like healed he'll heal to those heels i declare the world is healed
that's it that's all he would do he's so powerful it seems like why couldn't he just do that
right but instead we see him doing different things we see him releasing healing and deliverance
in different ways so we look at jesus jesus ministry
and he's releasing his healing and deliverance in different kinds of ways um let me give you an example for for
for when jesus is releasing provision the the fishermen there was fishermen who needed provision
they needed resources they needed money they needed food to eat and what what does he do he says lower
your nets into the sea he gave them direction prophetic
direction so jesus he could have just been like here you go here's money
or here you go here's fish out of thin air or you know but he gave them a direction
you need to take action you need to put you need to believe me you need to obey me and you need to go
to work you need to make an effort i know you fish and you fish and you see nothing but i'm directing you to still
do this even though it doesn't make sense in the physical realm they put the net they lowered the net
and so many fish came in right but there's there was something unique and specific that jesus directed
them to do for them to receive provision they needed provision but jesus did it in a specific way
there is a key there for them to receive their provision amen
there's there's a there's this time when lepers people who had leprosy came to jesus
and and he said to them leave me go go to the priests
show yourselves and on your way you will be healed
why did jesus is doing something different again he before he's just saying be healed or he's putting the
hand or you know but he's saying you're gonna leave me and you're actually not gonna be healed yet
but on your way you're going to be healed
there's another key jesus saw the keys needed the key for them was obedience was faith
with surrender to god that was the key needed for their
freedom for their healing that's why he said that that's why he wasn't just he wasn't just trying to switch it up and
do creative things these are prophetic keys of how to be
free of how to be healed hallelujah
now we see a gentleman with leprosy one gentleman comes to jesus and he says you need to
go to the priest and give an offering amen that's that's that's luke 5 14. he
says give an offering see he could see the key for that
gentleman to be healed was for him to give an offering to god he saw in the spiritual realm that was the prophetic
key you see you see how there's so many
different keys luke 8 49 we see this among many other examples
many times jesus says to sometimes jesus just he says be healed or i send the word
to your to your servant be healed he's healed but many times we see jesus saying
believe and you will be healed believe and your child will raise from
the dead they will be healed when you believe he could see the prophetic key
that was needed to unlock the healing
there's a story of a man who was very wealthy and jesus tells
him you lack one thing sell everything that you have this is luke 18 22
sell everything that you have and distribute the money to the poor
that wasn't jesus speaking that to every person that when you have money or when
you are wealthy you have to sell every single thing and give every single thing to the poor
that was not jesus instruction to every person that was his instruction to specifically that
man because jesus knew the key that was needed to unlock his deliverance
amen he knew he could see that his heart was greedy
and the only way for him to be free of that it doesn't matter how much jesus prayed
he actually had to do something about it he had to take action
to make that greed go away jesus saw that and so he gave him that prophetic key
you need to sell everything and then you'll be free and then you'll be healed
hallelujah so i wanted to to expand a little bit you know two weeks ago i shared and
that's what johnny that's where johnny received this prophetic instruction from god two weeks ago i shared about
the importance of sewing what sewing really is what tithing what
giving offering what planting seeds what the meaning of that really is the
importance of it and all the different kinds of giving there's different kinds of giving like giving a thanksgiving
offering to god just thanking him it talks about how we if we give if we bring our tithe and
offerings god says test me when you do that i will pour out so many blessings
you won't have room for all the blessings and and
i will rebuke the devourer so when we know we bring our tithes
and offerings that's unlocking the spiritual blessings abundance financial provision
in our lives and rebuking the devourer because the devil is after your money he comes to
steal kill and destroy he wants to steal your money so so when
we tithe when we give offering that is when
god rebukes the devourer so if you didn't see this message it's
on my youtube on apostle catherine's youtube apostle catherine crick youtube
um you can just type in a possible correct you'll find it it's from not last week the week before
so i taught on on i taught on sewing but today i want to speak specifically
on this key of sowing to receive your freedom
and healing when that is one's key that's not everybody's key but that was
a johnny's key and that is other people's keys amen
it's so important when you hear this that we're talking about prophetic keys
we are not talking about pain for deliverance
deliverance is free amen people are are thinking so much
physical people are thinking so much physical in the church they think that when they give money to
a church they think they're giving it to a person they think they're giving it to to an organization
you are giving it to god amen and when you give money to god there are
so many things that are happening there is something powerful happening where your material physical resources are
making the kingdom to advance just like these physical resources of
cameras and phones are making it so millions can receive healing and deliverance they're physical
items though right and they cost physical money so when you buildings cost money
many things to advance the kingdom costs money so when you do give to a church you are
making the kingdom to go forth and more people to receive
you're doing that through in the way that physical money works but but also this is a big thing the
church doesn't know there's a spiritual thing happening
the devourer is rebuked you're receiving the reaping the blessings from god
and there's more there's more there's more
that this may be the key for your deliverance it's a spiritual thing that's done
we need to stop looking at money as some physical thing but just as johnny had shared i shared i
told you you featured my message today this is amazing just as she shared it's
money today we need it to survive
if you don't have a roof over your head or food to eat that's going to distress you about more
than anything right i mean money has people's heart so much in this
world and so when we're giving to god it's it's about god wanting us to surrender
everything surrender our heart we need to make sacrifice to god
surrender is sacrifice sacrificing not in just the ways that that we want like i'll sacrifice my time
i'll sacrifice my energy no everything
sacrifice our money too that's part of the surrender
and that's why it's so important that we don't hold back but we give all to god
the biggest key to receiving deliverance is to surrender
to god to position yourself where anointing is
flowing and to surrender to god and what made me surrender to god for the first time in
my life after being a christian for 24 years was being in the anointing of god
because that's where he tangibly touched me and encountered me for the first time
which made my eyes open up to how amazing he is
and how worthy he is of my surrender so i desired more than anything to surrender
so the anointing positioning yourself where the anointing is and surrender are the biggest keys
from there a key to receive deliverance there are different keys that people have some
sometimes the key is for you to renounce to renounce meaning
to say this area in my life where i used to sin this area in my life where i opened a
door or this area in my life where my family had opened up a door past generations were
involved in witchcraft or someone abused me and a door was opened there through that abuse
i've renounced that specifically naming what it is i renounce anxiety i renounce
words of death spoken over me i realized words of death i spoke over over other people i renounced the witchcraft that
was done in my family i renoun i renounced these soul ties that relationship i was in when i allowed
that manipulation to happen and there's these soul ties i renounced that you renounce i renounce the night terrors
you renounce every little thing you're identifying the open door where the enemy came in and had access and you're
using the authority god's giving you you're speaking the power of life
amen and you're you're saying devil i don't want you in my life anymore you have to get out
that's the action of renouncing and when you position yourself where anointing is it's like when you renounce
the chains are unlocked and now the anointing can take away the chains
you've done your part and now the anointing jesus through the anointing does the rest amen
so many times the key is to renounce or you you haven't renounced everything there are certain things you
haven't renounced yet you need to re sometimes that's the key sometimes the key is
throwing away certain objects that were connected to witchcraft perhaps
or items through that demonic soul tie that you that are attached to that demonic soul tie that were given to you
by somebody you got to throw those away maybe you believed in crystals for healing or you
believed in certain jewelry was going to give you luck or healing or you burned sage because you believed
it would keep evil spirits away or something so those things throat you need to throw them away
that can be a key you see how there are different keys for everyone it depends sometimes
there's multiple keys and then sometimes there is the key is
sewing a seed sometimes when there's witchcraft done
in the family when you don't have jesus anything's possible unfortunately the
truth is is that when someone's involved in witchcraft they will sacrifice their
future family members like they will like
the devil will demand that they make a sacrifice for them to increase
ranking in the demonic realm and for them to receive blessings from the devil which are not
blessings because the blessings of god come without sorrow and the blessings of the devil which aren't really blessings
come with sorrow their curses so for example people want fame people want money they will go into the demonic
kingdom to search for these things to receive these things but they come with a price
so this is what really this is why we see so much oppression this is why we see oppression
in children because sometimes there was witchcraft done in generations past and they said specifically
that person in this generation first born or whatever this specific person that's going to come
sacrifice them so there's this curse upon them sometimes it's an early death sometimes
it's that they will have sickness or some problem and in the demonic kingdom they don't mess
around they mean serious business they they they are willing to pay thousands of dollars
to do witchcraft on people to do witchcraft on future generations
and so sometimes that happens sometimes they will say i pay this money to put this curse on this person
so there's a different kind of entanglement demonic entanglement that that person with that curse would have
than someone who maybe dabbled with addiction or dabbled with
drugs and now has a spirit of addiction and they can just be free and instant perhaps if that's all it is
that's different than someone doing serious witchcraft pain money
meaning serious business in the demonic kingdom and sacrificing upon somebody so there are some people
have that ajani had witchcraft in her she knew this witchcraft and her family line
so witchcraft isn't just this harmless like practice of religion the devil demands things they demand to
make sacrifices and the thing is is god
god is so good and he is able to free you completely
you don't have to suffer from a curse that was put on you but you but we need to have the apostolic and prophetic
ministry to release these keys you just need to be obedient
and receive these keys and obey god to be released
once again if the key was to sow a seed it's not paying god all it's not paying anybody
or paying god for this all money every possession you have belongs to god god gave it to you
so we need to have that mindset that whatever we're doing whatever we're surrendering whatever we're giving to god whatever money we're giving to god
it's just obedience to him it's just giving to him
it's just doing what he asks amen amen
and i mean the people in the world they they don't mess around they're they're there's they
mean serious business the people in the kingdom of darkness they mean serious business
they'll listen to advice and they'll do it right but
but it christians to complain
right or they say i don't want to do that i'm
jesus i i've got jesus i don't need to do anything right but then they stay in bondage
jesus is so good he's freed us of every curse he's given us abundant life freedom and
healing but we just have to align ourselves to god's principles god's ways
to receive that amen it's not as simple as jesus i give you my life and then boom poof
everything's taken care of you have to do things god's way align
yourself with how he flows position yourself where prophetic anointing is to release the keys needed
to unlock that complete abundant life in your life i speak so passionately about abundant
about the abundant life john 10 10 that god's given us because i have received it
and i have these keys and i feel like so few people know
and they're available they're free these testimonies that i shared with you and johnny's testimonies
it's so simple god's so powerful we don't have to do much effort we just have to
obey you should be humble and childlike to receive his keys and no pay
that's it amen
[Applause] now i want to share with you
um some scriptures about this where we see this happening in the bible
um so before i do so when a curse is put upon someone and
someone's even paid money for that the way to break that curse is for to
give an offering to remove yourself from that curse when there has been a sacrifice that's
an example also a seed could be required if there's been a lot of witchcraft in your family
or if you yourself have done witchcraft a seat can be required if you've if you
find yourself needing so much deliverance again and again and again and again
that's an indicator that you should give more to god including a seed maybe you're not giving
enough to god maybe there's been more demonic influence in your life than you
imagined than you realized maybe the relationships you had in your life there was
witchcraft happening more than you realized that's an indicator that you should sow
a special offering to god for this deliverance amen amen
um so in first kings
first kings three verse four
i'm going to read this passage to you do you know the story about king solomon of about how he could ask god anything
and he asked god for wisdom for discernment you know that story
do you know you know you know god asked him that question right a god solomon i'll give
you anything what do you want i'll give you anything
do you ever ask yourself what made god like ask him that
why why did god ask specifically solomon i'll give you any anything you ask anything
do you know that do you know do you ever wonder that because i know you know the story
first kings three it says that solomon
went to gibeon near the jerusalem where the tabernacle and the bronze altar stood he went to
gibeon to sacrifice there for that was the great high place
solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar
he brought a big offering to god in gibeon the lord appeared to solomon
in a dream at night right after he gave that huge offering
and god then said ask me what i shall give you
so upon solomon's outstanding sacrifice
god then shows up
god's heart was moved upon that sacrifice
and solomon received so much so much more than that offering
that was given he he he tells god i want i want an
understanding mind and hearing heart to judge your people so that i may discern between good and evil and god says behold i have done as you
have asked hallelujah i've given you a wise and discerning heart so that no one before
you was your equal no one shall be equal to you arise after you i've given you what you have
i have also given what you have not asked both wealth and honors that there will be so that there will so that there
will be anyone equal to you among the kings for all of your days so there will not be so wow he gives
this huge offering he had in his heart he had in his heart i want wisdom how am i gonna do this i
really need god to come through for me i really need wisdom i need discernment of how to rule his people
i'm gonna give an offering to god for this need that i have
and upon that god shows up and he gives him what he needed
and so much more so he sacrificed money for god and then god gave him wealth
which he didn't even ask for wow
hallelujah powerful amen amen the bible's full of these keys of this this beautiful
insight of how god moves
second samuel 24 verse 18
there's a there's a time when when when when a prophet commanded david to go up
and set up an altar to the lord on the flesh threshing floor of arunua
so he went and did that he was going to set up an altar and aruna says why why have you come king
david to me and david said i've come to buy the threshing floor from you to
build an altar to the lord so that the so that the plague may be held back from
the people aranewa said to david let my lord the king take an offer up whatever seems
good to him look here oxen for the burnt offering and threshing sludges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood
all of this o king arunua gives to the king so in other words david came i'm coming to buy
i'm coming to sacrifice for the lord and arunua says no you're a servant of the
of the lord here take it take it take it but david saw a problem in that because
this specifically was supposed to be david's sacrifice to the lord financial
sacrifice and god had commanded him to sacrifice for him
so david said no i'm not going to take it freely but i
will certainly buy it from you for a price i will not offer burnt offerings to the lord my god which cost me
nothing so david purchased the threshing floor and the oxen for 50 shekels of silver
david built an altar to the lord there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
so so he did that and then it goes on to say so the lord was moved to compassion by
david's prayer for the land and the plague was held back from israel
surrender is what moves god's heart
god wants to give you abundant life but he needs your surrender he needs all of you
to move his heart to release it
if you can have if you want a lukewarm christian life that's what you'll get
if you want a life with lack that's what you'll get but if you want abundant life you need
to surrender and move god's heart with your surrender
which includes sacrifice
this is powerful there's so many examples in scripture when when people sacrificed then god moved for the knee
they had and more
genesis i'm giving you a lot of scripture because this is important for you to understand amen
genesis 8 verse 20. noah built an altar to the lord
when he finally came out from the floods and finally came to the land
he built an altar and he took up every ceremonial clean animal and of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings
on the altar the lord here johnny's preaching my message again
the lord smelled the pleasing aroma a soothing satisfying scent amplified
says and the lord said to himself as as he smelled this
sacrifice then the lord said i will never again curse the ground because of man
for the intent of man's heart is wicked from his youth and i will never again destroy every living thing as i have
done he said that after this sacrifice was
made and his heart was touched by the sweet aroma of the sacrifice
and as i mentioned before we see this we see this in the new testament 2 luke 5 14 jesus ordered the man with leprosy to
tell no one that he was healed but he says but go and show yourself to the priest
and make an offering for your purification
just as moses commanded as a testimony to them that this is the work of messiah
so jesus commanded him to sow an offering for this healing
that was his key amen luke 7 verse 46
there's a woman who poured expensive costly perfume oil on
jesus's feet it was very expensive money she just put she gave to jesus just for
the sake of giving it to jesus
and jesus says i'm going to talk about her everywhere what she's done is so great we should
pay attention when jesus says something like that when when somebody does something so powerful that jesus says i'm going to
tell about her whatever my god wherever my name is preach wherever the gospel is preached her name will be told about
will be shared we should pay attention what did she do we should follow her example yeah
we better give our most precious oil precious perfume sacrifice
it costs there's spiritual meaning to that too prophetic spiritual meaning to that too but there is the literal
meaning of what she did it was expensive it cost her money a lot she could have done a lot more
things with that practical things with that money
and there was something significant about giving it to the to the kingdom of god to the work of god to the church
they say sell it to the poor and and some and when you give to the poor you're giving to god too
but don't say don't don't think in your be free of that lie that says don't give
to the church you know because you don't know what they're doing with it be free of that so you can
be free [Music] you need to give to the poor hallelujah
you need to give to the poor and to the church you need to help the widows and the orphans and the church
not just the poor you need to help them both it's all giving to god but we cannot
skip the work of god where these offerings carry so much weight
whenever they're giving offerings it was the house of god it was the altar it was the tabernacle
so jesus actually declares deliverance to her after she pours out this expensive
perfume to him he says
jesus says to the woman after she does this your faith in me has saved you go in peace
be free now zacchaeus luke 19 verse 8 zacchaeus
says lord i am now you know zacchaeus you know he stole he was stealing a lot
of money he he was doing bad he was not doing good things with his money so then he's convicted and he realizes
he's given so much to the devil's kingdom he needs to give so much more to god's kingdom he's convicted of that
and and it says see lord i am says see lord i am now giving half of my
possessions to the poor and if i have cheated anyone out of anything i will give back four times as much
jesus said to him then after zacchaeus says i'm going to give now i'm going to give jesus said
today salvation has come to this household because he too is a spiritual
son of abraham hallelujah
it's powerful with this revelation when you see when it is that jesus is speaking these things speaking this deliverance after
that key is unlocked for them to give
when you realize the importance of giving to god and how much it will release to you how
much spiritually and physically it will release to you you will be serious about
giving to god i've come to the point now where i'm like really like making sure
i don't want to like give anything under what god wants me to give
you know i want to go above and beyond this is a big deal this is a big deal i want god to always
be pleased with me for this sweet aroma to come to him that i would be pleasing to him in this way as well there's so
many different ways we please him but in this way i want to make sure i'm pleasing him too i want to make sure i'm
giving him offering just to thank him like forgetting everything else for getting my benefits my spiritual
benefits my physical benefits the reaping all of that just to thank him i want to give to him i want to sacrifice
just to thank him just like you do your friends you sacrifice gifts for them
amen and i want to make sure for my own freedom my own healing so i'm not complaining why don't i have this
why why is this going wrong well maybe it's my fault maybe i haven't been giving what i need to be giving to god
and then a step further my calling i need to be fully freed and healed so god can use me fully
i have to be that's a big deal so that i take it seriously giving appropriately
to god because of the spiritual significance of this that many christians don't know
the devil loves ignorant people
he loves when people are ignorant to this truth that i'm sharing with you today
that's how he's able to bind them and oppress them
so how do we not be ignorant humble ourselves
humble ourselves just obey god test god he says test me in this
god will never fail you he will never fail you to come through for you to release the provision you
need he will never fail you to deliver you
to heal you when you do what he asks of you
when the keys can be unlocked when you're obedient to unlock those keys
amen hallelujah and whenever whenever you are delivered
those of you that those of you that will be delivered today you know the bible says
that when we sow god then rebukes the devourer
when you're delivered there's a passage you know about you know you know the passage about how when one demon leaves
he goes around and finds seven others and they're trying to come back
if you don't if you don't feel yourself they can come back with more but what does feel yourself mean
this means surrendering to god keep coming where the anointing is flowing
so you can be fully equipped so you can shut every door to the enemy
so we can't sneak back in any way so you can receive anointing that sets you on fire to keep you focused on jesus
so through your days you can focus on him read the word spend time with him because you've been filled by his power
amen that's what being that's how but also
to sow to god to sow god god rebukes the devourer but
when you sow to god upon your deliverance a special seed it is like god is building a spiritual
protection barrier around you
protecting you from the enemy that wants to try to come back
so when you are delivered sow a seed to god so a seed of thanksgiving
and and for protection to seal that deliverance god's made a
new covenant with you that day to set you free
sow a seed to seal that covenant now amen
psalms 10 5 says no covenant is made without an outstanding offering
so these demonic covenants that are made i want to sacrifice this person
i want to put sometimes people do out of jealousy i want to put i'm going to sacrifice this person i want to put a curse on this person
this is what they'll do with the witchcraft or in future family lines they're making sacrifice they don't just
say that they spend money right so in the kingdom of god we need to make
sacrifice with the covenants that god makes us amen
hallelujah and depending and and really surrender to god with this
like depending on your like a johnny went and asked god what she should give and she says it hurt a
little bit that's important like you need you need to make sure
you're giving enough to god when we're speaking of this deliverance
she needed because of the witchcraft because of possibly even past generations had paid money for specifically her whatever the
witchcraft was going on she needed to sow a seed she had to seek god for what that should be not just give a little bit because
they'd given so much for her for the curse amen so that's important
that you surrender to god you seek him about that according to how much bondage there is
give him a seed worthy of that amen
hallelujah praise god thank you jesus thank you jesus for the keys
thank you jesus for your precious keys so that every one of us every person
here can be fully set free complete deliverance that abundant life
is their portion thank you jesus
Receiving & Maintaining Your Deliverance
