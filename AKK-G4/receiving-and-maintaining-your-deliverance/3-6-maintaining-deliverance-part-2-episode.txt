I taught a message on how to maintain your deliverance and this is not a short
topic so we we had part one of this and so
today will be part two of how to maintain your deliverance
maintaining your deliverance is something you have to take action on it doesn't just happen automatically it's
very important we take it seriously once we are free we need to understand
I now have to maintain this I now have to keep this or I will lose it
it's important we take it seriously we have the reverence reverence for God so that he can lead us
perfectly to maintain this freedom and go from glory to glory walking in Abundant Life amen so
just to recap I just want to mention the keys the keys of how to maintain your deliverance that I began to share
last week so first of all we know there's a
scripture in Matthew 12 43 where it talks about to sum it up to to give you
the revelation of it without reading it again since we went over it last week already this scripture speaks about how
when one demon leaves it's looking to see if it can come back and it is its plan is to bring others
back with it so that the oppression actually is worse than before they were
delivered that's the devil's plan that's the Demon's plan um and so that's why I say you have to
take action on maintaining your deliverance you have to be on the defense
and you have to take this seriously so the first step in the first step or
key in how to maintain your deliverance is to value
the Deliverance that you have received to Value Jesus himself
that you would that you would not take lightly what he's done for you everything that he's
done for you what he did for you on the cross but also that you wouldn't forget
specifically that Deliverance that you would really value it that you
would remember it that you wouldn't forget it that you would bring it to membrane to meditate on it continually
so that you can value it and the next key is to surrender your
whole life to God your entire life your dreams your
passion your will every part is to be surrendered to God the next key is to shut doors
shut open doors in the spiritual realm that are open for
demons to come in shut the doors that number one some sometimes when you come
to receive Deliverance they're already open like the door of a addiction uh the
door when you're drugs alcohol you're you're doing drugs and alcohol and you're addicted to these
things in porn in masturbation you're addicted to these things and you're not stopping because you're in bondage so
the door's still open even though you're trying to shut it but because you're in bondage you can't shut it no matter how
hard you try you come to the where Jesus is moving in power you receive Deliverance
now you ha now you have the ability by the power of the Holy Spirit to shut
that door because you're no longer in Chains just like when you're in handcuffs you can't do many things
so you're in handcuffs in the spiritual realm and you can't cut you can't shut some doors until you're free to now shut
them so you need to shut those doors that are specifically having to do with the
Deliverance you received and then also evaluate all of the open doors in your
life because just because it doesn't mean that you it doesn't mean that you don't have any doors open just because
you don't have bondage you could be too too risky right now in your life you
could be speaking too casually speaking words of death occasionally and maybe a
demon hasn't come in yet because of the words of death you're speaking or your careless words but now
that you are free remember the devil means serious business he want he wants more demons to come
back so now he might capitalize on a place you've been lazy in the spiritual Realm
so you need to take inventory on your life and get serious now I really need to get serious about my surrender I I
really need to get serious about these things that I have just lived my whole life doing I need to shut every door
amen
so that's the recap from last week so now today we're going to part two
so this scripture I'm going to read the scripture again that I that I gave you
the revelation of in the beginning Matthew 12 43 when an impure Spirit comes out of a person it goes through
arid places seeking rests and does not find it then it says I will return to the house I left when it arrives it
finds the house unoccupied swept clean and put in order then it goes and takes with it seven other Spirits more wicked
than itself and they go in and live there and the final condition of that person is worse than the first that is
how it will be with this wicked generation and a summary by Wicked
generation it's really speaking of people who are not valuing what Jesus did for them and surrendering their lives
that's to summarize what it means when you're not valuing your deliverance when you're not surrendering and giving all to God that's evil that's wicked
so so that's why this is happening that's why more demons are coming in because of a wicked generation that
won't won't value what should be valued above everything else Jesus and what he
does for you and that he's worthy to give your whole life to him
so this passage it's talking about how it finds the house unoccupied swept
clean and put in order the passion translation says it goes back only to find that the house is vacant warm and
ready for it to move back in and so it's looking and it's basically seen
the fact that it's warm it's meaning like nothing has changed like the demon left
and it looks and it's the same as how it was left nothing's changed
so he's able to come back the Demon's able to come back in so what we need to do is we need to change
ourselves we need to change that space so it looks completely different and
demons cannot come back they find it looking different they find it filled with something that's not the
demons so what it needs to be filled with now that the Demon's gone and it's vacant is
the Holy Spirit that's what we need to fill ourselves with and fill those vacant spaces with
and that's when the demon says I can't go back because the holy spirit's there it's like it's locked shut I can't go
there [Applause]
so um in Ephesians 5 18 19 it says do not get drunk on wine instead be filled with
the spirit with the Holy Spirit so I'm gonna teach you right now what
this means it's very important for you under to understand what filling yourself with the holy
spirit means because many people they know this verse about yeah demons will go back you have
to fill you have to be filled with Holy Spirit but they don't know what that means or they have a very small
revelation of what that means or they have a religious revelation of what that means
it means first of all first of all
when you are set free if you are where the power of God is that's what destroys
the Yoke the demon is cast out you are in the place where the anointing is
where the power of God is you are in a place where God is moving in power to heal to deliver to fill his people
with him with more of him with more of his Spirit you are in a place where the
baptism of the Holy Spirit comes where God comes in Fire and baptizes his people
you are in a place where the anointing is just flowing and just coming and touching you what's important to
understand is when you come to church here where God's anointing is where God's kingdom is I am a vessel but I am
not the one responsible for the Miracles I I am not it's not like I am the one
doing everything it's not like I am in control God uses
me as a vessel and he instructs me to speak to walk an authority to release
but when I'm doing these things when I'm walking in Authority when I'm releasing as a vessel
I'm releasing the power of God to move upon you all and then for God to do what
he wants
[Applause] um you know you don't have to wait for me
to give say a one-on-one prayer even even to speak every single thing that you need deliverance from
because God is the one doing all the Miracles God will do more than just what I speak
God is not limited to me and what I speak God is so much bigger than than me like
as a vessel so much of his power flows out and he's doing different things
doing what he wants there's a woman from New Mexico a couple weeks ago here at the baptism service like three weeks ago
on the beach this is a great example of what I'm talking about um I was just praying one-on-one for
somebody and she's just in the crowd and all of a sudden she runs up to the altar runs to the front and she says I can see
God just open up my eyes I don't need my glasses anymore
Hallelujah but I had not declared at that point
every person here who is blind or cannot see well may your eyes open up now I did
not pray one on one for her no but but she was in the presence of where the
anointing was I was releasing the anointing see God is the one in control
God is The Miracle Worker and God does a whole lot more than we realize or give
him credit for
like I may list several things command certain things or you know certain
demons to go depression anxiety I might say several things but God has done
maybe a million things for his people
amen so that's something you need to understand when you're coming to where God's power is you're not coming waiting
for me to do something for you to do something specifically for you you're coming to encounter God you know
he's moving in power you know that he knows your needs and all that you don't
even know that you need and you know that he's going to come himself
and release the Miracles himself do whatever he wants to do and what needs to be done in your life when you
come to where God's power is [Applause]
um so some sometimes people that there's a lot of people many times who can be critical
about um how to cast out demons and many people they they have so much fear with
this scripture that I just read about when one goes out many more can come in and so you'll see people being critical
online you'll see people they they think in a religious way that the moment I
cast a demon out of someone for example I need to be like I baptize you in the Holy Spirit right now come on
come on you know like like me myself
getting them to be filled with the spirit like it's me it's my control no
no Hallelujah that's not how it works
you are in the presence of where God's power is you know there's a story in the Bible of the the apostles they were
preaching one time some of the Apostles they were preaching I believe it's Peter they're preaching and the Bible says that all of a sudden
as they were preaching the Holy Spirit fell upon the people and they started speaking in new tongues
they're just preaching similarly to when I preach and many times a demon shrieks
I didn't start commanding things hey you there's a demon in that person come out of you I see you in the back no
I'm just preaching but I'm a vessel the anointing is Flowing they're in the presence of the anointing so God God is
the anointing Jesus is the anointing the anointing is the power of God God himself God who comes in power
so it's like Jesus himself is like hovering upon you all like I'm ready I'm
gonna move I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that I'm gonna I'm gonna make my anointing my power myself Jesus come
upon that demon right now during this sermon right now all Paul's got this preaching and make that demon a shriek
that's Jesus that's not me doing something to get that person to manifest
amen Hallelujah so
um you know as vessels of God and children of God we shouldn't be worried we are not the ones in control
so um many times as I pray for someone as I command the demon to go
many times they are already they begin to just speak in tongues all of a sudden
without me saying I baptize you in the Holy Spirit without me saying um fire of the Holy Spirit come upon you
sometimes I do that but I know that it's not in my control and I know that God's Gonna Fill that
person when the Deliverance happens they will be filled they are in the presence of the anointing it's it's I always
declare receive the power receive the anointing but it's not me who's doing anything it's God so we can rest in that
amen the same power of God that's here to make demons go whenever God wants a
tremble and go is the same power of God that's coming in Fire and baptizing his people and
filling his people amen hallelujah what is important though is
we as vessels of God we have to and administers we have to be open to
Holy Spirit coming however he wants and so there's some people that aren't walking in the anointing
um and because they are embarrassed of the Holy Spirit In some ways
they are embarrassed of the speaking in tongues or how the Holy Spirit manifests so in that place the anointing is not
going to be coming to baptize people in fire but when you are a vessel of the anointing and you embrace the holy
spirit in all of his ways you're proud of the Holy Spirit you love the holy spirit in all of his ways you don't care what Holy Spirit does you love to hear
people breaking out in tongues you love to see the power of God push somebody down
Hallelujah you love to see people break out in holy laughter overcome with the
joy of the Lord you you love you love it you love all the manifestations of the Holy Spirit
that's when God can put his anointing that's Unlimited in you put that anointing in you where he can do
whatever he wants and whatever is needed to be done amen
and this goes the other way too the person themselves needs to be open to receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit
they have to be open they have to desire it they have to want it
and so the baptism the Holy Spirit it happens differently for everybody
you got to be ready for it you got to want it and you've got to you for for many
people it's about surrender that's what it that's when it happened for me is when I was ready to surrender my
whole life to God um because when the the baptism of the
Holy Spirit that's more of the Holy Spirit when you when you receive Jesus as your lord you receive the Holy Spirit but there's always more of the Holy
Spirit that we can receive there's three different in in dwellings
of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit when you receive upon salvation the baptism of the Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit
comes up as as fire comes upon people as fire like we read about in the acts Church
and people would begin to speak in tongues this would happen as the apostles would lay hands sometimes
and also as they were preaching that's more of the Holy Spirit and when the baptism the Holy Spirit comes it's like
you're giving him permission to really fill you more so much that it's
overtaking your flesh when you receive the baptismal Holy Spirit you find that your flesh as as
long as you are embracing the the fire of the Holy Spirit and praying in
tongues and being pure and seeking God this holy the holy spirit will become so
strong in you and push the flesh down that's what happens when you receive the
baptism Holy Spirit it's not this like struggle between the flesh so much but you've received more
of the Holy Spirit you receive the fire and so now it's less struggle because you have more of God more of his help
it's like he's he's given permission by you to take control
of your spiritual life to push down that flesh so that's why this surrender is
necessary amen because to receive the Bible holy spirit it's you saying I'm ready for my
flesh to go down I don't want to hang on to it anymore so come and help me come and fire and help me
and then the third indwelling would be the anointing the power of God that destroys Yokes many people are baptized
in the Holy Spirit but carry no power of God no anointing demons aren't going when people aren't
being healed as they pray for them that's that's another level of the Holy Spirit the anointing amen
so the first part of filling yourself with the Holy Spirit is receiving the
baptism of the Holy Spirit so you need to make sure you're surrendered sometimes people receive
deliverance and they aren't surrendered yet because God delivers those who come to him
and sometimes those who come to him have come straight from the world
but God doesn't make them sit in the back and say stay here a little bit before I cast The Demon out of you
because it's a demon that's made them be in the world and hang on to the world and make them be stuck in the world so
God needs their freedom from that demon so they they don't have to go back to that alcohol to that to the drugs to the
sex [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] so sometimes a person's delivered but
they're not ready yet for surrender many times that they become ready quickly because they encounter God's love so
powerfully through this encounter through this Deliverance that's what happens many times but
people do have free will so first of all you need to desire God to overtake your
life you need to desire more of him you need to desire the baptism of the Holy Spirit
that this gift you need to help you push down that flesh and have victory over
the flesh I remember the moment I received the baptism Holy Spirit was the moment that my flesh was so it just
became so weak from that day the moment I received the baptism of the Holy Spirit
this is this is so important you need to desire this gift because it's not possible to truly be
surrendered to God and be so transformed into his image and walk an abundant life
without it amen so being filled with the holy spirit
means being baptized in the Holy Spirit and keeping that gift alive in you
praying in tongues make it a practice pray in the tongues pray in tongues
regularly this is a gift you are speaking directly to the Holy Spirit When you pray in the spirit
directly a Heavenly language that God has given you and as you pray in the spirit it's making your spirit Man Fan
into flame it's pushing down your flesh it's one of the ways of how we build up
our spirit man amen so value that gift
even though it's been 10 15 years that you've had the gift you need to still value it and you still need to pray in
the spirit amen this is one of the ways that you're feeling being filled with the Holy
Spirit the next part of filling yourself with
the Holy Spirit is having a relationship with God
having intimacy and having a real friendship with God
some people they think to be a Christian means is something that you're you do
is like a lifestyle and it's something you do you go to church you read the Bible
you pray because you're supposed to pray and you pray religious prayers
you pray as if God is far away and speaks a different language than you
you speak in a not the normal way that you speak
you speak in a way that you think sounds more spiritual makes you sound more
spiritual and important spiritually or something makes you feel yes I prayed really good
prayed really well you pray in a way that makes you feel I pray good
it's about something you do many people make it about something they do but being a Christian isn't about something
you do it's about having a relationship with God [Applause]
and so the basics the basics of having a relationship with
God is to read his word because the word is God the Bible says
the word is God his voice his words to you are in the Bible
and as you read his word it's how you get to he hear how he speaks and get to know his
character get to know really how he wants you to live like
the more you get the word in you the the more this transformation comes
spiritually to to act like him to be more like him and to know how to hear
his voice to know how to discern between the devil's voice and God's voice and your
own voice is how you get being in the word getting the word in you is how when you're going
throughout your day-to-day you can recognize God's voice so you need to really get to know who
God is his heart his character and the number one place to find that out to
learn about him to get to know him is in his word
so this is and and as you read the word of God it's important for you to know that you're hearing from God directly
he's going to be speaking to you in his word it's not just like Words a book
written like a history book or a textbook but it's alive
God is speaking presently today through it to you so this is part of the ways we
have relationship with God is hear him in the word
and it's also important when you've been delivered to be be in the gospels be in
the New Testament and it's specifically at first the gospels read them like every day
get the word in you get it in you so much because when the Devil Comes you
have the word so much in you that he won't disrupt you the way he would if the word wasn't in
you [Applause] you
you will be strong and be able to be victorious against the devil's attacks this is how Jesus was Victorious over
the devil in the wilderness when he was tempted he had the word in him the devil came in
such a sneaky seductive way and he was twisting the word of God so he came
really sneakily if if Jesus didn't know the word of God might have been tricked
right but he knew the word of God the word of God was in him completely so
the devil no matter how sneaky he was could not win so it's the same for you today you need
to get the word in you this is part of what the devil sees when he looks back the demons try to come back but you the
word is filled in that space you are filled with the word of God in that space
you are filled with the Holy Spirit you're filled with the baptism of fire you're filled with the word of God I'm
teaching you all the different ways how to be filled so this is part of the filling
[Applause] and
part of having a relationship with God is prayer and worship
not I'm not talking about formal prayer and worship as an activity as I was sharing before something that you do
I'm going to pray I'm going to worship to do it but it should be personal
with the Revelation that you are talking to God not that you're praying like I'm
doing something to be a good Christian to check this box off the checklist if I
have to do this to be a good Christian but instead of thinking pray think
speaking to God hearing from God having communication with God
because so many times people people they need to start thinking of it that way because they think prayer prayer and
they think what they've known their whole life which is the religious religious prayer we don't want the
religious prayer doing religious activities keeps you farther from God so we want to get all that religious
junk out so commune with God have intimacy with God by having Revelation
that the holy spirit is with you all the time all the time not just in the prayer
closet not just in the room where you do your specific one-hour prayer a day
but the holy spirit is with you all the time and wants you to be aware of that
include him in your life communicate with him hear from him in your day to
day bring him everywhere renew your mind he is with me God is
with me and when you're blessed by things throughout your day thank him for it
include him randomly tell him I love you
you know just like you would someone you really love they're with you in the car you're silent but you know that they're
there and you say I love you do that for God really have intimacy and
real friendship with him um because this is this is so key I mean
surrender to God is about knowing God's love and falling in love for him and
wanting to please him wanting to touch his heart wanting to obey him always and never
grieve him that's when that's your heart then
you're going to be able to really surrender to God but you're not going to be able to surrender to God if you're trying to do
something be a good Christian the only way you can surrender is to
really have this relationship to know his love to love him back and so throughout your days you know
God's with me I want to make him proud he sees me right now
I want to touch his heart I want to please him I'm going to do my best I'm going to work with Excellence I'm going
to work hard I'm going to be loving to this person I'm going to Crucify My Flesh
I'm going to serve him well he sees me he's with me I want to make
him proud that's how you're gonna Hallelujah that's how you're going to be able to
really surrender this is what's needed to be able to shut all the doors to the
devil that real surrender so worship and prayer I'm including together because
many times people think of prayer as something you do
religiously and then they also think of worship as something you do on Sunday I'm going to worship God
but a big part of prayer or communication and relationship with God
should also constantly include worship and when you don't know what to say to
God it is it's not that there's something wrong with you you're not spiritual enough you don't love him enough many times that it's just time to
worship Him I find I I worship him more than anything
because I'm content I know I know I'm in his hands
whatever weapon formed against me that's going on My Life currently I know won't prosper
I trust him so that means I'm not I'm not needing to complain
that cuts off about 90 of some of your prayer time that you're having [Applause]
Hallelujah that's not the right way to pray
in fact that that that's a part of speaking words of death that you're not supposed to be doing you're supposed to trust God declare
declare when God is asking you to declare like sometimes you need to take action against the attacks in your life
instead of going and complaining to God about it do something about this God says I gave you Authority
declare declare and rest that I've got it under control so that's
how we should live our lives we walk in authority when God calls us to but it's not like we're having to ah command you
to go devil and you you better get out of here and you better stop with my fan and you bet simply declare
you don't need to over and over and over again trust God's got it
there's in some sort of I don't know Injustice happening to you false accusation or something something weird happening to you in your apartment or
your workplace something like that declare simple this evil must stop
no weapon formed against me shall prosper I command this attack through this person must stop now
in Jesus name thank you Jesus and then begin to thank him and worship him thank you Jesus for protecting me thank you
Jesus that you're my Defender thank you Jesus that your hands upon my life thank you Jesus that you're taking care of
this situation and that's it you don't worry about it the rest of the day you don't complain
about just other people you don't complain about it to God you don't pray and over and over again God stop it make it stop make it
you rest it's done I declared simply I trust God's got it and now I'm going to
continue doing what God called me to do and worship him
so that's why I say I I spend most of my time in terms of prayer worshiping God
like I'm serving God I'm going about the business that he called me to do he calls me to declare sometimes walk in
authority but day to day I'm doing what he's called me to do and I'm blessed when you're in God's will you're blessed
it's Abundant Life and so I noticed the blessings and I feel gratitude and I remember to thank
him thank you Lord thank you for doing this God you're good wow Praise You Lord thank you Jesus thank you for coming
through in this way thank you for this blessing thank you for your promise being fulfilled here I'm seeing right
now thank you Jesus thank you for this beautiful sunset thank you for this flower this is beautiful that you
created worship worship and prayer I put in one together
amen hallelujah praise God so that is a quick summary to you a
quick summary to you a quick teaching of how to have relationship with God
so how to have relationship with God is a big part of filling yourself
with the spirit is having that relationship the demons look and they see oh they have a real relationship
with God amen Hallelujah
so um you know this is really important by the way that I want to mention one more
thing before I come to the second part of how to fill yourself with the spirit
and that is what I'm covering right now to the the whole filling yourself with the spirit
and deciding to do something to take action in this way is it's very important that once you're
delivered you you decide you need to make change in your life
you decide I want to change I need to change because
when you're delivered some of you need more Deliverance when you're delivered sometimes
that bondage was really holding you back in areas in your heart like there's
Pride there's selfish ambition there's bad motives
and when there's bondage it becomes hard it becomes difficult to be transformed
by God in all these areas because really the the Deliverance is like vital we need to get the demons out we need to
get because they're taken over they're filling you with darkness that you can't even focus on transforming
being transformed by God in your heart and so Deliverance is vital this is why
oh boy we need this anointing in the body of Christ today we Deliverance is vital it's first and
then once you're delivered now it's time to go from glory to glory and access Abundant Life Walk in the Abundant Life
and this comes from being transformed into the image of God as you're being transformed into the image of God you're
able to be very Victorious over the devil like never before so he is not allowed to come in any old way so this
is how you're progressing God's taking you higher you're seeing that Abundant Life in your life come in
your life because you're being strong and Victorious over the devil because the Abundant Life Is Life absent of the
devil having a hold in your life so now you're as you're transformed into
the image of God more you're stronger you're more spiritual so now you're able to reject the devil reject the devil
reject the devil and now you're seeing this whoa Abundant Life here Abundant Life there Abundant Life here because
you're shutting every door as you're being transformed into God's image [Applause]
and so the devil can't come in and God's able to release these blessings and
they're able to stay in you so you go glory to glory
but we have to be transformed into the image of God for this to happen and so
when you get delivered it's so important you make this decision I desire to change
I desire for the Holy Spirit to fill me and change this Heart of Mine
This Heart of mine has Pride selfish ambition bad motives I have a lot of
thoughts from the devil that have come through come in my head for so long and I haven't rejected them so it's pretty
much kind of who I am I need to change I want to change I don't want to be this
person anymore [Applause] I want to be like God I want to be
humble I want to be pure I want to be holy I want to be like him I want that I
want to please him and I want to be like him you have to make this decision
or else you're in for a rude awakening of the devil taking over your life coming back in and coming back stronger
and this is what happens people will be delivered this is what can happen people will be delivered
because who doesn't want Deliverance and God's good he doesn't withhold Deliverance he gives free will
but some people they don't want to change they don't want to let go of the evil in
their heart and so they're like whoa I'm delivered and now
I'm gonna just keep going with my life the way it was or now I'm delivered and I'm gonna just
go on with my ambitions selfish ambitions
and what happens there is you're not filling yourself with the Holy Spirit you're not letting the Holy Spirit come
in and change you and the devil sees there's a way back in now
it's warm and vacant it has not been changed inside that
heart has not been changed and that's when demons can come back that's when demons can come and
deceive people a lot of people they they get deliverance and they don't get the pride out of them
so this next they're delivered and the next day they're a prophet
next day they're called to be a Deliverance minister they're called to start their own
Ministry Pride
you don't become a prophet day one after you're delivered you don't become a FIFA Minister day one
after you be after you've been delivered if you remember my message from a couple weeks ago God does not reveal callings
like this when we want it when it's convenient for us he re he reveals that when we are ready
when we've been through the fire when our heart has been molded when we've come to the place where we're like Lord I just want your will
whether it's cleaning toilets whether it's being behind the scenes never seen by anybody or a minister of you and
carrying your anointing powerfully whatever we get to that place and then God
reveals that those types of callings usually but I see this a lot of times people are
delivered and the next moment they they full of pride
they want to skip any kind of molding process and it's like the Devil comes and
Whispers And this is a warning for you all by the way some of you are like oh
no this is a warning I'm giving you a warning right now because when you're delivered it's time to get serious about transforming your heart not not time to
start a Ministry [Music] laughs [Applause]
and as I said before when you're in bondage it is it is holding you back from your heart being transformed and so
humble yourself when you've been delivered no I got work to do now my
heart needs to be transformed now now we get to really be refined in here
amen so this is a warning be aware that this is the devil's scheme he's so mad
you're free and he knows the easy way to come in is this stronghold of Pride that's in the heart so the angel of
Light can even speak things the Devil Comes masquerading himself as
an angel of Light the Bible says sounding spiritual you're a prophet you're an apostle start your ministry
now and then a person gets deeper in Pride
as they accept these things right after they're delivered and goes way off course
from God's will so we need to be aware of the scheme of the devil upon once we're delivered amen
Hallelujah going back to what I was teaching you PRI right before this I was teaching you
how to fill yourself with the Holy Spirit there's the first part that's having to do with your personal intimacy
your personal relationship with God that's really just up to you to receive the baptism Holy Spirit you need to
desire that but you also need to position yourself where God's power is to be in a place where the fire of the
holy spirit's released but to desire that that's on you to be
in the word that's on you to pray and worship to have communication with God intimacy with God and worship him that's
on you so part one of filling yourself is completely on you with your
relationship with God you and God together the relationship
but then there's a second part of how to fill yourself with the Holy
Spirit and that is that you need to stay
connected to where the power of God is moving
you need to stay connected to where the anointing that was flowing that made the
demons to go from your life because the anointing is not just to
cast out demons that's not the only thing that the anointing does the power of God does that's not the only thing
you need it for you need the power of God and the anointing for many many things
in your spiritual life amen so
it says in Ephesians 4 11.
Christ himself gave the apostles the prophets the evangelists the pastors and
teachers to equip his people for works of service so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity
in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of
Christ then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves and blown
here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people and their deceitful scheming
this is God's church that he has designed for his body so that his body
could be equipped by anointed teaching by anointed discipling by anointed
training Revival army training
by anointed spiritual mothers or fathers and fathers
and this church to be able to release this anointing upon your lives
impartation of anointing so you can be a powerful vessel of God and be trained and equipped to be a powerful vessel of
God how to walk in the anointing how to execute the authority properly this is your calling on this Earth to to
be victorious over the devil and to be a vessel of God in his fullness in his
power amen so God can do whatever he wants
through you he wants to move in power so God's system of equipping and
releasing that anointing so you can fulfill your purpose be victorious over the devil and fulfill your purpose God's
system is his church his true church which has the fivefold ministry
and this is what God's doing in this revival is he's restoring his five-fold ministry his Apostles and His prophets
because Hallelujah because when we have them when we have
all of them then we will be fully equipped lacking no spiritual nutrients
amen so and by the way this is why we're called
five-fold Church because God gave us this name because
this is what he's doing now he's restoring the five-fold ministry to the body of Christ in this revival and
that's a big key of why this revival is taking place how is taking place because
this is God's Revival God's way and in this revival it's a must that
Apostles and Prophets are restored to the body of Christ This is the End Time Revival
and God is restoring the anointing to the whole body of Christ but for God to do that
for it to not just be a couple people walk into the anointing but all true believers who are really surrendered God
has to have his system in place of how
the people will be equipped and how they will receive that anointing impartation
of anointing it has to be in place that's why it's so
vital and important in this revival that's that's why it's I say it's
Revival God's way it's not a Revival where just Miracles are happening
but God had intention and purpose in this revival and because we are being
obedient to what God wants for his Revival for his church that's why we are
seeing the fruit that's why we're seeing the anointing move powerfully many people be free in their lives
transformed amen Hallelujah so
so in the word of God it says it says Psalm Psalms 1 3 that person is
like a tree planted by streams of water which yields its fruit in season and
whose Leaf does not wither whatever they do prospers
so the revelation of the scriptures speaking of when you are planted
where God's power is in his true church where he's leading you to be
specifically you where he's leading you to be planted
when you plant yourself you will be fruitful in your spiritual
life in every season your leaves will not wither
being planted where God's power is moving where he has called you to be in his true church
is vital to maintain your deliverance to maintain your deliverance to be
victorious over the devil and to fulfill your purpose to receive anointing and be equipped to
walk in your purpose it is vital and so
whenever anyone comes here for deliverance it's important some of you coming here for deliverance it's so
important for you to know that this isn't just a place just to come get your fill
get what you need and leave I mean you can do that if you want you
have free will but it's I warn you it's very dangerous in the spiritual Realm
being planted where God's power is is vital to maintaining your freedom
because of these reasons this is where you're equipped over the
against the devil's attacks the devil is sneaky the devil is tricky you cannot be Victorious on your own you
need the anointed equipping anointed teaching
your relationship with God and reading the word of God is very important but that's not where you will get all of
this important equipping where your spiritual eyes will open up
so much is going to happen here with this anointed teaching your
spiritual eyes open up and you see that's what the devil's doing that's the devil's schemes oh this is how he comes
I'm prepared now I make note of this I am taking this seriously I'm writing notes I'm watching this again so I can
be like a warrior prepared for battle when the day of evil comes [Applause]
[Music] I mean pretty much every message here we
I I'm telling you about the devil's schemes
I'm teaching you it's not milky stuff here it's meat that you need to be victorious over the devil
[Applause] so I'm teaching you I'm revealing to you
I'm warning you this is how the devil works this is how he's gonna try to come in your life at
some time be prepared my people perish because of lack of knowledge but you shall know the
truth and the truth will help you stay free you shall know these are all the sneaky
ways the devil works so when he comes you will have victory
he won't be able to come back amen so this equipping the teaching the
warning the the opening of your spiritual eyes is why you need to be planted God God is amazing it's
prophetic anointing here and so it's not a teaching according to what I want to teach what I like to
teach the teaching that comes forth here every Sunday is what God wants is what God knows that you need God knows a
specific attack of the devil happening for I mean the devil will come many times upon a whole church body in a
certain way so so God knows this is what the devil has planned I'm releasing this word to
protect them [Applause]
so you are given the battle plan of the devil and so you're able to have Victory and
not be caught off guard amen Hallelujah so that's one of the big
reasons you need to be planted number two you need to be planted because every time you come here every time you tune
in online the anointing is pouring upon you in addition to the anointing that's
coming and feeding your spirit man through the teaching anointing is pouring upon you
you need this anointing to come upon you every day every week continually
when you are planted you have a covering now
as a as a leader of the church as a spiritual mother this anointing that I
carry literally that same anointing comes upon
your life to protect you
we have the Holy Spirit to protect us but how come so many people are in bondage that are Christians a big reason
is they need the covering that comes when you plant yourself
because this is God's system of releasing that specific protection
that deeper protection against these deep demonic schemes of the devil amen Hallelujah
this anointing also comes upon every area of your life as you continue to come and receive and sow and serve not
just come in like a buffet and eat but you water you want you come in water so you can be
refreshed and watered you sow you serve you don't just come and receive
that's what makes the anointing to continually pour and flow over every area of your life so just the anointing
continually flowing in your life I'm not even talking about the teaching right now just the anointing is releasing
protection and is helping you to maintain your deliverance
[Applause] Hallelujah thank you Jesus
thank you Jesus praise God praise God
and and also I mean as simple as this is God's way this is part of what being
a Believer is is being a part of the body being planted where God is calling you
to be planted in a church body this can be online too if you want to be planted online you can email info at
fivefchurch.org we'll share with you how to be planted online but this is part of God's way this is
part of our instructions our commands that he gives us when he's talking about this five-fold ministry he's not talking about it for
fun he's talking about this is for you you
need to be a part of this you need equipping from this place this happens in the church come to my real church and be planted
there and continue to receive this anointing and equipping in your life there
[Applause] so just the simple fact that
that planting yourself where God is calling you to be planted and showing up continually every Sunday every live
session in the week that is simply obedience to God and that's one of the
ways we keep doors shut to the devil because opening a door to the devil is simply
disobeying God is simply not following his command that opens a door
so just for that simple fact that's keeping a door open as well if you're not taking it seriously being planted
amen so people should not be coming here for deliverance and go back to their
lukewarm Church they're not going to be equipped they are not going to have the anointing coming upon their life that they need
for protection and they are not going to know the devil's plans they're not going to get that equipping they need
and people coming here for deliverance just to get it like going to the doctor or getting a pill you know getting a fix
and then going back and living their life they're going to get more demons in both of those scenarios the demons
will come back so this is important this is important we've got to be
planted amen and there's such a Grace just being planted there is such a Grace you do not
need to worry about demons coming back you need to have the fear of God but you don't need to worry
when you can take these instructions from god seriously when you can just plant yourself
you don't need to fear you'll find wow that teaching I needed
and I was able to have victory over the devil praise God
Hallelujah and you will you will find as you're
planted and you're you are even seeing the power of being planted you are seeing the anointing come over your life
you are you're noticing whoa the devil came this way and I was equipped this is going to help you to be even more
passionate about just being implanted and you'll rest knowing I don't need to
worry God's got me I'm getting all the equipping I need I'm getting the
anointing I need I will I'm confident I will walk in victory over the devil every day
amen we are not to be in fear of that scripture that says when one goes more
want to come back but we are to have the fear of God and take him seriously and take god
seriously at his word at his work at his word in the word of God and the Rhema word of God the
present tense word of God coming forth amen hallelujah hallelujah
so this is part two we're going deep so and we're leaving no room for the devil
this is a bunch of Victorious children of God here [Applause] [Music]
this is God's Revival Army who will be strong and Victorious over the devil we
mean business here amen hallelujah
[Music]
everyone one more [Music]
time [Music]
