well today I'm going to share with you how to hear
God's voice Hallelujah are you excited
to learn how to hear God's voice God is speaking
he's speaking he's speaking always he is speaking
he's a spirit though so we have to learn spiritually how to hear his voice and
how to discern his voice we're used to hearing things just physical wise we have to learn how to
hear spiritually with our spiritual ears amen
about a month or so ago I shared a message on how to have a relationship with God if you didn't see that you can
search that on our YouTube I encourage you to watch that and today we're going to go even more in depth
with how to hear God's voice as you have a relationship with God the first way to hear God's voice is in
the word of God the Bible the Bible says in John 1 it says that in the beginning was the word and the Word
was with God and the Word was God the word is God the Bible the word is
100 God's words amen
and so this is our foundation of hearing God's voice this is our
foundation this is where we must start
when you read the word of God when you read it with the Holy Spirit not reading like a textbook but if you
sit down with the word of God and you surrender to God and you invite
God in you say God I want to hear from you speak to me Lord I'm not just doing this out of a
religious routine I'm not doing this to make myself like feel like a better Christian because it's not about
performance amen but it's about relationship with
God and actually hearing his voice but if we get into a religious routine about it or if we have that religious
mindset performance mindset like if I read two chapters a day then I know I'm doing
good as a Christian we're actually blocking God's voice because we are coming religiously
in the Pharisees they were full of religion they couldn't hear God's voice at all
they knew the word of God so well they read the word of God all the time they knew it in and out but they weren't
actually hearing God's voice as they read the word of God because they were coming religiously
they were coming with performance so we can't come that way or else we
won't hear God's God's word we can become like Pharisees and use God's word against the actual work of God that's
what the Pharisees did when we're not hearing God accurately through the word of God so it's
important when you read the word of God to come humbly and to understand you
have to get this out of you that God is is judging your relationship with him you have to get this out of out of you
get it out get that Doctrine out that God is monitoring you and judging your Bible reading time
you need to get that out of you get it out get that Doctrine out that's the meaning of empty yourself out empty
yourself out of junk that God's revealed to you is not of him it maybe had been
taught to you in the church by other people you once respected maybe but now God has opened your eyes like right now
God is opening your eyes get it out don't let it stay renew your mind of
that Revelation you've had of what intimacy with God looks like what relationship looks like
amen so as you come to the word of God remind yourself of that that I am here
to spend time with God I am here to hear God's voice I'm not here to be a better
Christian better Christian performance-wise I'm not here to check off my checklist of things I need to do to be a good
Christian I'm not here to make God say okay I'm proud of you now because you've done
that you know or I I approve of you rather we want to please God but I approve of you rather
that our works is not what makes God have approval of us amen
so come to the word of God humbly with that heart of Lord I just
want to hear your voice and allow the Holy Spirit to lead maybe sometimes it was a crazy day something happened and
you weren't able to spend a full chapter in the word or something and you're tired but you're like I want to hear God
though and you open up the word come with that Heart Lord I want to hear you and read sometimes it could just be a
verse but God can speak to you so much through one verse
so much if you come with that heart amen so as you read the word of God with the
Holy Spirit and and also by the way you're here receiving equipping you're here receiving anointed teaching so this
this is helping you read with the proper revelation read what the holy spirit's Revelation
not the religious revelation for example before you might have read religiously with performance but now
you've your eyes have been opened up through that through this teaching so now this is helping you actually hear
the Holy Spirit when you read the word of God Hallelujah
Hallelujah so now when you read the word of God the word of God is full of stories about
God stories about how he uh how he loves
his people and is faithful to his people and so as we read the word of God we we
learn about who God is his character his consistency his faithfulness is so
consistent that's what's so powerful about the word of God he never fails and we see all these people in all these
different circumstances whether they had enemies that threw them in a pit whether they had enemies chasing them down to
die it didn't matter God's promises still remained God fought their battles for them God defeated their enemies
every time God defeated their enemies and God came through and God was
faithful and God was loving God was just God was loving God was merciful god was compassionate that was God every time
we see that again and again and again so now reading the word of God the more you read the word of God if you're getting
to know God's heart more you're getting to know his character more once you know the word of once you're
getting to know the word of God well now you now you can start to hear God in your day-to-day
like as you're doing errands when you're in the workplace when you're hanging out with friends wherever you can start to
hear God's voice in life when you're not reading the Bible
because God can still be God's still speaking amen come I want to pray for him right now
Hallelujah thank you Jesus
God wants to heal him right now and he's proud of you for your faith
and how you just drove here fast
it's okay it's okay so do you want to renounce anything do you know what renouncing means
so renounce means so this is a key for deliverance many times things are generational
um they they come from past Generations demonic spirits demonic curses and they pass down
so for example if there's any kind of Witchcraft in the the past Generations like in your life or or your parents or
anywhere in his mother's Generations that that's an open door for the enemy
to come in and you see it later on in their later generations um so also a key a key of seeing freedom
is to renounce any kind of open door of the enemy like through witchcraft but also like in your personal life and also
if you know his mom's personal life like any way of sin anything of like words of
death spoken of your life like I want to give up or I don't want to live stuff like that words of death
that's an open door as well so you can you can just speak all those things and also so all the open doors that the
enemy could have come in through through sin through Witchcraft and past generations and also everything that's
not of God in his life in your life so I renounce autism I renounce him not uh
listening or behaving or obeying I I renounce him not thinking clearly all
those things you you can speak that now and we have another microphone right or
did I renounce
all the sin and the open doors that I opened for the for the enemy I renounce
him not listening or announce drugs I renounced um not living right I renounce
um Witchcraft and my family's generational curses I renounce
his mom his family did witchcraft I renounced that in Jesus name
um our announced gangs every now and say
I pronounce it just not living right and do you know any more details about
the Witchcraft that was done on the mom's side but you told me her grandma used to do witchcraft
um I don't know how extensive it was or what she did but she told me that her grandma used to do witchcraft
okay Hallelujah God is bringing Freedom now to this family into him
thank you Jesus I break every generational curse off this family now I
Break Every curse of Witchcraft that was sent Upon This Boy's Life I cancel every sacrifice that was made upon his life
that he would suffer that he would suffer in his mind and I'd attach you now from all you have renounced in Jesus
name and on three every Spirit attached every Spirit bringing mental harm every
Spirit bringing autism every Spirit of Witchcraft must go in Jesus name
one two three out to now
thank you Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah I declare healing over his
mind now I declare a clear mind a sound mind in Jesus name and I declare no more
disruption of his mind but him to have peace now and think clearly in Jesus
name thank you God thank you Jesus I speak this anointing
to fill you both now in Jesus name and God Is Lifting lifting off the pain
that you've been feeling the the just the pain of the burdens in life
the burdens that come with the the Demonic oppression he's lifting that off you now because God's saying that he
knows that you've been so heavy and he's heard you cry out to him and he's answering you now and things will
be different now you will have peace now thank you Jesus
you will have peace now yes he's heard you and he loves you so
much you keep seeking him and you will see complete Abundant Life in every area
come to you because this is how much God loves you that he wants you to have Abundant Life peace and joy in every
area Hallelujah
Hallelujah praise God praise God
Hallelujah anything God can do and he's doing it now
Hallelujah and so I was just in Beaumont Texas and it was
two-day Revival on the first day the same thing happened it was in the beginning of the it was this in the
middle of the message a woman came there with her son and the son was being disruptive I said I'd stop the message
just come here I want to pray for you now I prayed for them he was peaceful then and then the next day she comes
back and she testifies that he's completely different he's peaceful now she was testifying with tears
Hallelujah God is doing the impossible
hallelujah praise God praise God thank you Jesus thank you
Jesus so hearing God's voice
when you know the word of God you start to be more and more confident of who God
is who God is he's loving he's full of Mercy he's full of compassion the Bible
says there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus
and when I read my Bible I I look at Jesus I read about Jesus I read about
how he treated people and I would see other people judge people like the adulterer
this woman doing many sins and they were saying we want to Stone her
but Jesus says if any of you have sinned if you have none of you have sinned you
can cast the first stone none of them could throw the stone and the way he just treats this woman after that
it's just with such love and compassion and we just keep seeing this throughout
the word of God how Jesus treats people it's not just that woman it's every person who is a sinner every person he
treats with just this is Jesus he's like he comes with love he comes and he's like
I want to deliver you I want to heal you I want you to know that I love you he
heals them he delivers them he shows them his love and then when he says go
and sin no more like that woman who who had committed adultery he said it after he after she encountered his great love
he then said to her go and sin no more so he's basically saying follow me
that's not the right way to go I want you to have Abundant Life so follow me
you're delivered now so that so for example Demons of addiction uh are no
longer there to stop you from from sinning no more now you're free to go sin no more
you see many the church many people in the church are saying stop sinning stop
sinning because they're reading reading the Bible wrong the reading the reading when it says
when Jesus says go into no more for example they're reading it like going sin no more
goings and no more you know with condemnation but when I read my Bible when I read it
with the Holy Spirit I find Jesus never condemning when he speaks he's not speaking with
condemnation he's revealing his love and then he's giving he's then instructing people
follow me but he's not hiding and not revealing himself and keeping people in bondage
and saying come follow me and that's what the church does by and large I mean that's what we've seen in the
church for so long we've seen people not demonstrating the power of God where God's love Israel do you see how God's
love is revealed to that gentleman there do you see how through a prophetic word
he knew that God was with him and heard his prayers you see he could no God loves me
and so from today he's gonna live differently because he's he's actually had an encounter with God's love
this is how it's supposed to be not that we would preach judgmental condemning messages and saying you need
to stop sin with and withholding God's love to people when we show God's love to people then
people will want to follow Jesus the kindness of God leads us to repentance that's my testimony I was
lukewarm until I had an encounter with this power where I was moved to tears God loves me he's with me I had
Revelation and from that day I surrendered and I never looked back
the kindness of God leads to leads to repentance condemnation does not lead to
repentance preaching Jesus in a condemning way and
not showing his love not revealing his love through his power does not lead to repentance but it leads
to lukewarm Christians that's what happened to me for many years I've heard the same message I raised my
hand again and again but I remain lukewarm until I encounter God's love until anointed ministers who carried
God's power could show God's love to me could demonstrate the power and I had an encounter with God's love then I the
kindness of God his love revelation of his love and kindness led me to
repentance but I didn't come to you with wise and persuasive words I didn't come to you with tons of knowledge but I came to you
with a demonstration of the power of God so that your faith could rest on
God's power not on man's words you need to receive your teaching you're
equipping from from ministers from teachers who carried God's power so that
your faith can rest on God's power and not man's words for it which is many times wrong and condemning
makes you think of God not who he is and so many people live these condemning
lives like like they hear voices in their head all the time and they think it's God they think it's God but it's
full of condemnation it's full of you're not you're not reading the Bible enough you're not praying enough you're not doing this
enough you're not doing this enough oh you should be ashamed of yourself you did this they hear these voices in their
head and they think it's God but the Bible says there is no
condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus and God wants you to repent he
wants you to repent from sinning he want he but he comes with conviction not
condemnation and the conviction comes with kindness
not condemnation you're gonna go to hell if you do that
you really shouldn't do that I'm mad at you
that's not how it comes it comes with God showing his love to you
valation of oh so now you you serve him you want to please him because he's so good you you
love him with your heart not your mind you love him from your heart you want to
please him simple and God knows that God knows that's the only way you will change that's the only
way you will turn from sinning is if you know his love
it doesn't work the Pharisee way you end up Killing Jesus killing the work of God
you can't do it the performance way it never won't work you have to know God's love
to live rightly amen
Hallelujah so I'm now speaking of how to hear God's Voice through your day-to-day through
your day-to-day many people and I know many of you I used to be there too would hear so many condemning voices in the
head you need to know right now that's not Jesus the shame the judge the judging the
condemnation that's not Jesus he convicts with love kindness and gentleness
it's more like when you know you shouldn't do something this is God's voice my son my daughter
that way leads to destruction that way opens up doors for demons
that way is a road to depression anxiety Suicidal Thoughts
witchcraft entering the life I don't want that for you I love you my child go this way because this way is
the path to True Life this way the doors will be shut to Demons so they can't come in they won't
be a foothold for the demons this way is the path to Abundant Life my son my daughter I love you so much
and I want Abundant Life for you and I also want your purpose to be filled I
want to use you for my glory and it's only this way my son my daughter
that's God's voice that's God's voice amen
that's his voice but many of you have never heard this before so you've never heard you it's
it's it's so quiet God's voice that the devil's voice is so much louder
but you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free this is the truth
so today it's time to say no to the condemning voices amen
um so when you're going about your day-to-day now that you know that God is you know his character from reading his
word from coming to church and hearing the word of God faith says in the Bible faith comes from hearing and hearing the
word of God faith and the knowledge of God's love and his character and his
ways also comes from hearing and hearing the word of God Amen there's a quipping
happening here to help you hear God's voice so when you're in your day-to-day
sometimes God might be leading you to be a vessel of him
to love on somebody to give to somebody to be generous
he might lead you to do something like this to speak kind words to somebody
in your day-to-day you might get this feeling this urge
to compliment somebody to tell someone how much they mean to you to tell someone how you've noticed them
to tell someone something beautiful about them you might just get this urge
so how do we know if this is God's voice or not well we know that God is a God who wants to encourage and edify and
love and we're called as a body of Christ to edify and love each other to build each other up
and we know that in this world people need that we know that we're all in a spiritual war
so when you sometimes you might feel to do that and before today you might have just thought that was just your own self
your own self just like having a feeling and opinion about something but
it's God's heart to love people it's God's heart to encourage people and
build people up it's God's heart to distinguish the lies of the devil
so we need to walk with this revelation of when I get this feeling this urge
that I should love on somebody speak this kind word to somebody that's God
speaking to you that's God directing you I know it seems
like a very still small voice but the Bible says that's how he speaks to his people sometimes not in a wind or a big
earthquake but in the still small voice amen
so you need to know that the holy spirit is inside of you
he's in you right now when you receive Jesus as Lord
and savior of your life he comes and lives inside of you he's not dormant
he's living he's moving he's breathing he's speaking to you and you
Hallelujah and I'm telling you it is still and small you have to open your spiritual ear you have to
listen open up your listening ears and you will find God leading you to do
that you will find God leading you to be generous to somebody
sometimes a person might be in lack and God uses you to be
a vessel to bring abundance into them in that moment to show them that God cares God loves them God is taking care of
them listen to that voice and be generous to that person
amen Hallelujah also in your day-to-day
God is leading you and and directing you in in ways you should go throughout your day to day maybe
you for example somebody invites you to do something
but you don't really know this person and they don't seem they seem maybe kind of of the world but maybe they're inviting you to do
something sounds kind of fun maybe it's not even something super worldly maybe it's just go to some concert or
something like that some activity maybe you just meet them somewhere but then there might be this feeling you
get to not go so for example and this is with wisdom
too you start to use wisdom not just relying on the the feelings because the
feelings aren't always God we have to discern which feelings come from God Amen this is where we partner the the
inklings of the Holy Spirit which many come as a still Small Voice and also wisdom
wisdom wisdom of what opens doors to Devils amen as we've been learning here what
opens up doors to the enemy and so we know that the enemies coming tricky sneaky ways and so we should be
aware of that and so for example if someone's inviting you to go somewhere do something you don't really know this
person you use this kind of wisdom that you've learned you've used this wisdom that God has taught you
I don't really know this person this person by the way they're speaking doesn't really seem like they they know
God love God I don't I I don't know if this is very wise for me to put myself
in kind of control of this person you know get in their car let's say and go somewhere
you see what I'm saying so you can start to walk with the Holy Spirit as you know his character know
his voice and walk with this wisdom that God's God's taught you you start to flow in this way throughout your life
it's very important though that you that you apply that wisdom that you've learned that you don't just go with the
feelings because the enemy can come in a feeling too the enemy can come through coincidence too
um a big way that God when I was first learning how to hear God speak was through coincidence coincidence that
wasn't coincidence but God and this is many times God oh so many times so many times
I read this book and it opened up my eyes wow all these times all these coincidences they were actually God
now this was many years ago and this is before I learned about wisdom
by wisdom I mean learning these practical things these practical
spiritual things like this could open up a door to the devil you don't know this person don't get in a car with this
person like just because there are coincidences it's Don't Close Your Eyes
to wisdom does that make sense because sometimes these signs happen and
we want the thing to happen and so we we just close our eyes to wisdom
and we just go yes this must be God and that happened to me one time
and I I would just see God work through coincidences so often and one time you
see the devil sees that the devil sees that he saw that I was seeing God through coincidences so often
so one time he sent this this person to come in my life and it was all these
coincidences that were happening and long story short it was totally the devil trying to come and get access in
my life and put me in a dangerous situation and I learned so much from that day
that we have to pair that the the the inklings the the the the the
feelings that are many times God that still Small Voice we we have to pair that with also wisdom
amen and part of wisdom
is having Godly counsel in our lives
because I just shared with you ways we hear God we hear him through the word and we hear
the holy spirit because he lives inside of us and now that we know the word now we can recognize his voice by the way
when we when we hear a voice that says to uh there's this is an example if we have an
enemy and they're saying really mean things against us you'll probably hear a couple voices if you're not a Believer a
mature believer you only hear one voice swear words and in your head and
you want to say bad words to that person and you want to publicly say bad things about that person and you want to gossip
and tell everybody bad things about that person that's the only voice you'll probably hear and you'll probably just follow that voice
but if you are a mature believer who knows the word of God the word of God says this love your enemies
bless those who persecute you pray for those pray for your enemies bless them love them
you see how where do the knowing the word of God helps you to know God's voice in these situations so now you
have an enemy coming against you you have an enemy you have someone persecuting you doing mean things to you
if you don't know the word of God you're not going to be able to hear God's voice in this situation but when you know the word of God
now you'll hear maybe you hear a couple voices depending on your maturity level in Christ
you can hear one voice that says same mean things and do mean things back to them and gossip about them and say all
the bad things they've done to you and defend yourself and all this you'll hear that voice
but then you'll hear another voice that says bless them do not speak a single bad
word about them you rest be quiet stand still while God
fights your battles for you God is on your side and he will defend
you you don't need to worry about this you definitely don't need to speak bad things against this person
just bless them pray for them love them
there's two different voices one the first one I shared with you is from the Devil
the other was from God so in circumstances and lives many times
you'll hear a couple of those voices but the more you know God's word his
heart you're being equipped like here the more the stronger the God's voice
will be and the quicker you will be to know what is his voice
amen so this is how we hear God's voice the word of God the Holy Spirit speaking to
us leading us through our days and thirdly
we hear God's Voice through other people
through other people first of all I want you to know that you are a voice of God for other people because you have
Holy Spirit in you if you will be obedient to him and I and I shared I taught last week
about prophetic anointing there's prophetic anointing flowing here you're all prophetic people
so there there's a spiritual gift in you prophetic
so as you are are speaking to people as you were when you love on people
prophetic words are coming out of you and many times you don't know it for example when someone is feeling
really unseen and they don't feel beautiful and they feel like not smart
enough you just feel in your heart and maybe you've just seen it you've just noticed
this about them and you just say to them you shine so bright
you are needed you're a blessing to me there's times where I really needed you
I needed the words you said there's times in my life you just you bless me
you're such a star you shine so bright I see God just shining through you
you radiate God you're you're beautiful I see God's Beauty through you
now these are simple words you're not giving them their zip code
and their bank account number you know they're simple words like you're not seeing those things in the spiritual realm but they're prophetic nonetheless
and as you speak those words they can be as simple as I as you are beautiful in God's eyes
you are beautiful inside and out that's God speaking through you people need to hear that and you're a
vessel of God and God uses people like that God's using you like that every day and you don't even realize that many of you
God is using you many times people aren't telling you I needed to hear that word many people this this there's some of
you here where you've said something to somebody and it kept them from committing suicide I see this in the spiritual Realm
they just didn't feel like anybody saw them they just didn't feel like no one would notice if they weren't here
anymore they felt not loved at all but you just on that specific day just showed them so much love
and kicked out the level the LIE of the devil every time you love someone you are kind
to them you are generous every time you are a servant to people for God
you are literally being a vessel of God and God is speaking through you
every time you encourage somebody God is speaking through you isn't that exciting
Hallelujah the biggest way that God speaks is
actually through people the most overlooked way that God speaks
is through people because we are not seen spiritually
we don't know how to see spiritually many times we think seen spiritually is all of a
sudden our spiritual eyes just open and we start seeing angels and demons everywhere
a portal to heaven now I see spiritually
that's not seen spiritually I mean it can be but that's something that really what's seen spiritually is
seeing how God sees God uses people to speak
this is how he spoke the most throughout the Bible through Old Testament through New Testament
did you know that the New Testament and the Old Testament who wrote it
it's not a trick question people
God spoke through people
did you know that the Bible didn't fall from Heaven one day and it was just there God could have
done that do you know God is able to do that he's perfectly capable of doing that that would be pretty Epic
but he didn't do that he chose to speak through people to
write his word but the word of God is the word of God
we don't say it's a word of people people's words correct
God used people to speak 100 his word 100 his work that's why we say it's
completely the word of God they were able to be pure enough vessels for him to speak through them a hundred percent
clear amen
many times we forget this and also something we need to know is
that these people let's take Paul let's take
Peter these people many times they've been a spiritually
abused in the wrong way like worshiped and idolized all of the people in the world all of
the the prophets and the apostles and the word of God many times that people call them saints and they put huge
pictures bigger than Jesus and they they even pray to them
but we're only supposed to pray to God actually if we pray to anybody else but
God we're opening up a door because God is the only healer he's only healer God
he uses vessels but God himself is the only healer we're just vessels of the Healer like
we're vessels of the Healer we're vessels of the deliverer amen
so that all the glory should always go to God Paul should not take any of the glory but when we worship Paul we're
giving him glory we're reserving some of the glory for him and not giving it all to God
so there's people like that will pray like in the Catholic religion they'll pray to these these Saints they pray to
people as if okay I'm gonna pray for this and I will this is who I should pray for for this thing but God is the only one who
can bring healing who can bring protection who can bring abundance who can bring abundance in every area only
him so that's why we should only be praying to him amen
so there's been this wrong perception of the Bible of the people in the Bible
being so separate from from you and me today as vessels of God
there's been this idolization and in the same regard there's a lot of people that think that Miracles don't happen anymore
but they ended like in the what was written in the Bible that's having to do with people
idolizing these people these men and women of God in the Bible
but Paul and Peter I believe they're in heaven right now
saying I do not want you to idolize me and think that
you can never do what I did but I want to I want you to be inspired
by me Peter and Paul we are supposed to be inspired by we are not supposed to
idolize them but be inspired by them amen
I mean Jesus says you will do the things I did in Greater he wasn't speaking that just to the apostles he was speaking
that to you and me these signs shall follow those who believe they will heal the sick they
will cast out demons not just the first generation Church us here today in 2022
we shall raise the dead and heal the sick and cast out demons too
people shall be healed and delivered in our shadow too amen
we're we go from glory to glory that's God's way Elijah release the anointing to an Elijah to Elisha and Elisha walked
in a double portion of anointing he did way more miracles
than Elijah did this is the way of the Kingdom that as vessels we would go glory to
glory okay that being said we have not
understood how God uses people today still to speak his word
we idolize the people in the Bible and we don't realize that God actually
wants to move through people the same way he moved through the people in the New Testament
the same ways through Paul and Peter he wants to use us today so Paul was
speaking Apostle Paul was speaking true words of God Amen that's most of our new testament
God was speaking directly through him the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was God word was with God and the Word was God it says in John 1
1. so are God's words is what it's saying
they're exactly God's words so many times we are saying God speak to
me God speak to me and we think that that's going to be an audible voice we're looking for an audible voice
we're looking for a big vision many times we're looking for a big dream we're looking for Jesus to appear to us
in the flesh that's what we're looking for we're looking for a big experience that
we call a big Supernatural experience but I'm telling you that God speaking
through a vessel whom he's chosen is just as Supernatural as Jesus appearing
in the flesh it's God choosing to speak how he wants
to speak amen and so many so many of us have been
missing have been missing God's voice because we don't know how to hear his voice
we hear this is a big way that God is speaking is through people
number one he's speaking through people through every day everyday Believers the
whole body of Christ he's speaking through them like this
you are beautiful just the way you love is just beautiful
you are so kind that's God speaking that to you saying I love that about you
you are so loving you are beautiful that's God speaking when they say that to you when they encourage you that's
God encouraging you you're feeling so down I don't know if I'm good enough I don't know if I'm doing enough and
someone here says those words that you are doing so much and that thank you
that's God speaking God just spoke to you you need to learn how to receive it otherwise you're not going to be hearing
God's voice hardly ever and you're going to be like God doesn't speak to me and God's speaking to you all the time
you know I um I
did not want to preach ever I didn't know how I felt like I didn't know how to preach I felt like I wasn't a good preacher
I began preaching five years ago as of last week we just celebrated our five
year anniversary at fivefold church last week Hallelujah
but I was called to be an apostle and I did not want to be an apostle I did not want to be a preacher I felt like I had no clue how to preach but God was
calling me to do this so I just wanted to obey God so I did so I preached without feeling like I was a
good preacher and I'm telling you for about three and a half years three and a half to four years I would hear the
devil's voice in my head saying you're not a good preacher you're not good enough people aren't being blessed I
would hear that so many times like every single Sunday but you know the Chantal here she almost
ever probably pretty much every single Sunday through those three and a half years our church was very small almost every single Sunday she would tell me
your word blessed me and she spoke it from the heart she's like your word blessed me it touched me it was so
powerful I needed that thank you she would just speak very simply and it was
from the heart but I knew that was God speaking to me through her
I knew it was I knew it was because God called me to do what I was doing
so I knew I was in God's will and I knew God wouldn't make a fool out of me I knew you know I knew that God wouldn't
like forsake me and not give me words to speak when he told me to speak and that he would give me words to speak you know
what I mean so I knew that truth but I didn't feel that truth I would hear all the the opposite of that truth but then
she would speak that and it was this reminder of what God spoke to me in the past
and I said that's God's voice right now and I chose to hang on to that to say I
listened to that voice and I silence those other voices
so did God encourage me for three and a half years and tell me that you're a good preacher you're doing a good job
yes he did but it came through Chantal
but it was a hundred percent God it wasn't like 50 her I know it was a hundred percent God
amen we have to learn see if I didn't learn how to hear God's Voice through people I would not be preaching here
today I would not be I don't know what I would do if she
didn't encourage me all those times because the devil's voices were real and Loud every week for about three and a
half years and the church was getting smaller from 20 to 15 to 10 to 5 to 2 over 4 years each year
and hardly anyone would tell me they were encouraged by the word other times it was Vivian
and her mother and her father chantal's father but it was most every week Chantal so if
I didn't have her voice constantly I really I don't I mean that's how God chose to encourage me I'm here because
of God's encouragement and because he's given me everything I needed but without God's encouragement without
his voice I wouldn't be here today amen so you have to learn how to hear God's
voice stop being like it's so quiet no God is just speaking through people more than you realize because you're not
learning to hear spiritually I'm teaching you how to hear spiritually now
every time someone's kind love generous compassionate merciful forgiving to you
that's God's love that's God speaking to you he's speaking to you every day through
people amen but be wise to make sure you're only
grabbing what's of him amen don't be grabbing directional words from just anybody that's a bad idea and
that's a voice of the devil many times so be very wise to take the love the
edifying the encouragement take those words they could be from strangers that's fine
but they can't be directional words from just anybody you have to use that discernment and say I thank you Lord I
receive that amen hallelujah
so God speaks through everyday Christians when you use wisdom and discernment is this really God speaking
this love to me and number two God speaks through
his five-fold prophetic ministers today
amen it says in Ephesians 4 11 that God that
Jesus when he ascended to Heaven he poured out his spirit and he released gifts to the church
Ephesians 4 11 Amplified version it says and his gifts to the church were varied and he himself appointed some as
Apostles special Messengers special Messengers Representatives
so Apostles are special Messengers bringing a message from God
representing God in his kingdom amen this is what the Amplified word of God
describes as apostles some as Prophets who speak a new message from God to the
people this is the Amplified version in our new testament
it's right there that God uses Prophets to speak a new message
because God speaks Rhema words today logos means Bible written words that's
our Bible and he also speaks Rhema new present
tense words of God you look at Moses
Moses was sent to the Israelites to declare a new word of God
your time for deliverance is now God has heard your prayers your time for deliverance is now this is how it's
going to happen follow me God's chosen it to be this way follow me millions of
us are going to go out United okay that's how it happened amen
but you see how God chose to speak through a prophet 100 it was God's
speaking through a prophet God did not choose to give the millions
of people all the same dream why because the whole body of Christ is not mature
enough to be able to discern God's voice correctly there are some people who God sends a
dream and they miss it there's some people who the devil the devil sends them a dream and they
say God sent me this dream so they didn't all have the same dream because this is why God uses true anointed
prophets also Apostles special Messengers to speak a true word of God
for a group of the for the body of Christ or for a group of the body of Christ this is what God's saying because
we are not all mature enough to be able to discern God's voice correctly
we have to learn how to hear God's voice we have to grow in this and so if God
tried to speak to all of us at the same time like without through people like we
all have the same dream someone say it's from the devil someone say it's from God someone would say ah it's a funny dream
and then then Moses would say this is what God said you guys all had the dream
right half the people would not follow him you see what I'm saying
so this is why God had this is how he God has order in the body of Christ where he's still today speaking I know
we don't see it a lot but this is what God's restoring the five-fold ministry this is why God gave us the name faithful church God is restoring the
apostles and the prophets to the fivefold ministry now there won't be so much confusion and
Division in the body of Christ when we have the faithful Ministry in place God will speak this word it can be a
correcting word it can be a directional word but we can know this is a true prophet of God this is a true Apostle of
God speaking right now so this is God's word whether I like it whether I don't
whether it's uncomfortable or not I know this is God's this is God's word
because it's spoken through a true prophet of God a true Apostle of God
you know we say Revival is now and that all came from a prophet it was my spiritual father Prophet Jordan he
prophesied that God has heard America's prayers and cries for Revival
that we've been praying for so many generations for so many years and he has answered them and the time for Revival
is now for America Hallelujah Hallelujah
and he prophesied he says God sent me all the way from East Africa he sent me just to speak this message just like
Moses I mean in the meantime we're all praying for Revival some of us are distracted
some of us are not ready to bring in the Harvest we're just going about our own church lives lukewarm Church lives right
but then this word came Revival is now it's no long he said it's no longer the time to pray for Revival
this teaches us if if the whole body of Christ could learn how to hear prophets we wouldn't waste time
spending tons of money effort and energy doing a stadium-filled prayer for Revival conference but we'd actually be
being equipped receiving the anointing walking in the anointing and Healing The
Sick casting out demons and raising the Dead
seriously we are pioneering this right now it's a new thing that God's doing restoring the faithful Ministry But as
time goes on the whole body of Christ will be quicker to come along with the move of God
you know how many people God could use right now to cast up demons heal the sick but they're still praying for
Revival or they're still trying to do uh Revival in their own way or not God's
way it's true we have to learn how to hear God's voice
speaking through true anointed vessels because this is how God speaks and he
doesn't he doesn't waver in this people Miss God's will for their lives
because they won't listen to advice through anointed vessels of God
they want to hear God in their own way God speak to me
how I like to hear it so I can feel good in my room speak to me but God says I
already spoke through you spoke to you I spoke to you through that vessel
I'm speaking one time I want you to Value it and receive and walk in it
the prophecy for my life was to be an apostle and as I told you I did not want to be an apostle I wanted to be a singer
I did not want to be a minister I did not want to be an apostle I didn't want to preach I didn't want to pray for people I wanted to see people receive
God's power more than anything in my life but I had no dream of like praying for people I wanted to be on the
sidelines and cheer because I'd only seen one person praying for people so it didn't even come in my mind like I'd
only see one person casting out demons is what I meant so it didn't even come in my mind like I want God to use me
like that too it didn't even go in my mind so I hear this word from a prophet you're called to be an apostle
God wants to do many miracles through you you're called to start a church and I don't want to do any of these things
but I knew it was a true prophet of speaking by the way how do we how do we know when a true Prophet Apostle true
faithful Minister anointed vessel is speaking we look at the fruits the Bible says you shall know them by their fruits
you look at the fruits not with Pharisee eyes or you'll never see the fruits you call the fruits the devil
you'll call the fruits the work of the devil that's what the Pharisees did
but you come like a child humble without skepticism and criticism
you come with pure hearts the pure in heart shall see God it says
so it doesn't matter what you've heard Pharisees speak about Jesus you come and you watch Jesus Minister for the first
time with a pure heart not with preconceived notions and ideas
not with skepticism these Pharisees are saying something hmm I wonder if there's something to this let me look for the
bad you'll never see the fruits when you come like that because the Bible says it says that when
the demons were cast out by the apostles for the first time the the the apostles came back to Jesus
and they were like the disciples they were like we cast out demons the demons obeyed us and Jesus then says father I praise you
for hiding these things these spiritual things from those who
are prideful and you've only revealed it to those who are teachable childlike pure
humble you've only revealed it so to see spiritual things to see spiritual fruit
to see true anointed vessels of God whom God is speaking through you will not be
able to see them if you have pride you will not be able to see them if you have skepticism the only way you can see the fruit see
what's really of God is with the pure childlike humble heart and when you come
with a pure childlike heart God will speak to you very clearly
he will speak in your spirit this is real fruit this is a person of God
that's what happened to me with my spiritual father I didn't see him for long but I knew I I came with child
likeness and I saw the fruit immediately before my eyes as I missed as he ministered he prophesied to me and I knew this is a
true prophet of God so I received that word and I didn't let
any naysayers divert me from what God had spoken to me
I used wisdom remember we have to use wisdom I used wisdom to not go and take
a tally from all of my friends family acquaintances should I listen to this prophet of God even though none of you
have your spiritual eyes opened up to know that prophets are still speaking today and you don't even know about the
power of God in the baptismal Holy Spirit and you know that's not wisdom
but there's many people not walking in wisdom there's many people who are not walking
in humility and seeing people as people seeing people as people because they want their own will maybe and not God's
will instead of seeing people as a voice of God who whom God is speaking through
we have to have that kind of humility when God has showed us who a true spokesperson of God is a true vessel of
God we have not had this perception in the church very well we've we've treated and
part of that's because we haven't had a lot of like real anointing and real anointed faithful ministers it
hasn't been like tons so we've we've we've seen church for so long it's just this place like a bible
school like to get our knowledge and uh yeah I don't agree with quite everything that pastor says but uh
which is okay sometimes you know when it's maybe it's not an anointed Minister but like can you imagine people
saying that about Paul isn't that Pride sometimes you know like Apostle Paul
I don't really agree with anything that Apostle Paul says but he's okay he walks in Miracles and I like I re there's some
cool things he says we gotta humble ourselves more amen
because when when we get that I don't agree with everything it's probably that you haven't humbled yourself in an area for God to speak to you something you
haven't known in the spiritual realm yet
amen Hallelujah Hallelujah
so man we need to really change our way of thinking and REM and and know now
that God's speaking through people God's speaking through vessels when there are anointed vessels in your life when there
are if you have spiritual mothers spiritual father mentor if you
if you have questions ask them and and don't be too prideful to think I
I got it all I can hear God completely on my own there's certain things God is withholding from you in the secret place
in your prayer time where he actually wants to speak to you through a vessel but he wants you to humble yourself and
ask them advice amen there's so much so much secrets of how
I've got to where I am today where God's been able to pour anointing and use me for his glory so many of these secrets
is is this that I'm sharing with you right now is that humility I mean God is doing a new thing
but the new thing didn't come from just me sitting and Jesus appear to me and tell me all these new things like this
so much of these new Revelations of how to walk in the authority of Christ how
the demons can go from people and not take forever to leave but go fast so much of that Revelation has come from my
spiritual father teaching me God speaking through him
so much that I've learned has been me humbly in myself
and become teachable Lord teach me there's so much I don't know and you can teach me however you
want to teach me I humble myself amen
Hallelujah Hallelujah praise God praise God
thank you Jesus God wants you to hear his voice always and never miss it amen
but we have to open our eyes to really how where he's speaking not limit him
and we need to be humble that's a big thing to hear God's voice you gotta humble yourself you gotta humble yourself you got to
humble yourself to ask questions you got to humble yourself to hear something new through a vessel he's speaking
you gotta humble yourself to when you don't understand something you don't immediately discount it but you humble yourself and you're like
maybe maybe there's something I don't know in the spiritual realm that God wanted to teach me something new through this vessel
that's what happened with Jesus Jesus was speaking eat my blood or drink my
blood eat my body you're gonna need to do this he was speaking about communion of course but he just speaks these strong words
to thousands of his disciples and it says that most of them left him after that because they were offended by what
he spoke they were like this sounds weird
this doesn't sound like God I'm weirded out by this I think maybe I should go leave him
I don't know if I can trust him anymore all those voices prideful voices were going on in their head when instead they
should have humbled themselves and been like I've seen the fruits of Jesus
I've seen the fruits in my life I don't get what he is saying at all it
sounds so strange and weird but he is a true
voice of God who am I
maybe there's some things I need to learn still I think maybe I'll ask him what did you
mean by that I want to understand better you see that difference of humility
and then those disciples could have stayed they could have had their spiritual eyes open they could have learned they could have stayed
with him amen instead of left and one away from their calling
amen Hallelujah so now you shall hear God's voice you
shall hear his voice very well amen Hallelujah
Hallelujah you shall hear his voice more than ever in Jesus name you shall hear
his voice of love you shall hear his perfect voice of Direction you shall hear his beautiful kind voice of
Correction you shall hear his voice of encouragement and mercy in Jesus name
