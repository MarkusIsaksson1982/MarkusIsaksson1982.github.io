today um we're going to go deeper in how we how to pray the Jesus way
amen uh so last week I taught about how
to pray when you have an need for miracles because there's different types
of prayer prayer means a lot of different things and that's what we're covering what you're learning but last
week I specifically taught on praying how to pray when you need a
miracle amen and so to recap that the new wine way Jesus way by the way to
give a little recap for those of you don't don't know what I mean by the Jesus way um the Pharisees worship the
same God as Jesus same exact God and same exact word
of God it was just the Old Testament or Torah at that time but were worshiping
the same God believing in the same Bible word of God but yet their
theology was like the was like almost opposite was so different right I mean
not just did they were they unable to recognize Jesus as the Messiah they were believing for praying for uh praying for
uh after receiving all these prophecies about the Messiah they missed Jesus not only did they miss him they called him a
false prophet they called him they accused him of using demonic powers to cast out demons They Crucified him so
not only did they get it wrong with in that area well first of all if they're going to get that wrong there's a lot
more they're going to get wrong right because Jesus is the foundation right so um their
interpretation of the word of God was off it it you know they they they read
the word of God and they interpreted it a wrong way in many times and this is
what we call old wine but then Jesus came bringing
Revelation the the true Revelation from God this is the theology Doctrine we
believe in today this is what this is the the the the meaning of new
wine but what Jesus preached things like these signs shall
follow those who believe they shall cast out demons they shall heal the sick like he preached things like this
he preached things like um I anoint you as as an apostle and he and and you will
do the same things I did and greater you will do it he
says and and he he also says I'm giving I'm pouring out my spirit and I'm giving you gifts church and these gifts are the
apostles the prophets the Evangelist pastors and teachers and to summarize these gifts are to equip you
to build you up into maturity so you can be a powerful vessel of God and do the works that I'm calling you to Believers
and this will continue this equipping will continue until you come to the fullness of Christ which means when
Jesus returns so these types of things these are just examples that Jesus preached these things yet today in the
church people aren't believing these things really I mean they're they're
they're not really having that same doct and theology that Jesus did that that he
preached they aren't having the doctrine that Apostles and Prophets are part of
the they are the foundation according to Ephesians 2:20 that's New Testament with
Christ Jesus as the Chief Cornerstone they're not having the doctrine that the equipping that comes from the fivefold
ministry including the apostles and Prophets must continue meaning a Apostles Aren't Dead prophets aren't
dead so but the church by and large is not believing this is not having this
Doctrine so if they're not having that Doctrine it means they're missing new wine it means instead they are having
old wine same with these signs shall follow those who believe so why aren't people
embracing Deliverance in the church when it's supposed to be all who believe not like 1% of Believers not just like one
ministry here or there that likes Deliverance right all who right so
there's just a couple of examples to show you so you can really understand new wine the Jesus way Doctrine theology
is missing in the body of Christ by and large today that's why we needed Revival
that's why God brought Revival that's why we declare Revival is now
Hallelujah so so at 5f church a lot of the
teachings here are teachings maybe you haven't heard of before it seems like a new Theology and
Doctrine it probably is it's new wine not old wine it's not common new wine is
not common today and so when we say when I'm doing this series praying the Jesus
way I'm teaching you how to pray in the new wine
way what is pleasing to God how prayer is actually supposed to look like how
it's and and how prayer can be effective
amen praise God so last week I taught on um how to pray when you need Miracles
and to give you a little summary recap the way to pray to receive Miracles is
this first of all God chooses to use vessels to heal
and deliver deliver as his main way of releasing healing and freedom of doing
Miracles there are exceptions where he doesn't use a vessel but this is his main way his main
principle and he uses Servants of God leaders in the church like the five-fold
ministry to release that healing and deliverance like we see in the book of Acts where it says that the Believers
were continually in awe of the signs and wonders performed by the
apostles so that scripture shows us that the the the bulk of the signs and
wonders and miracles were happening at the church through the Servants of God leaders fivefold ministers Apostles
prophets because they have been given a Grace from God of a high level anointing
and a high level Authority amen so people to people today tend to
they pray they need a miracle they need healing they need freedom and their praying praying crying out to God in
their room or wherever but they're ignoring God's ways and principles which
is the new wine which many people don't know about right now or they do but they're they're prideful and they don't
want to do it God's way they don't want to receive from another vessel maybe or
maybe they don't like that vessel maybe they're jealous of that vessel or maybe
they'll get persecution if they come and receive through that vessel so
but but but the problem is is that God doesn't go against his word and his ways so usually when people are crying out
for miracles for healing for deliverance and they don't do it God's way which is coming
to the present day shadow of anointing like through Apostle Peter positioning
themselves where anointing is flowing through a servant of God usually when PE when people don't do that they don't see
the miracle they don't see healing they don't see Deliverance that's why we simply have to
do it God's way but when we do it God's way it becomes so easy to receive
Miracles it BEC becomes so simple like in the times of Peter they came under his shadow and the Bible says all were
healed the reason why number one he had such a high level anointing and Authority that even principalities had
to obey that's why all were healed why the miracle were happened with happening with so much ease and number two this is
God's way very simple this is how God chooses to heal
and deliver so if you'll just simply humble yourself and submit to God's ways
you'll see the Miracles take place in your life very simple Hallelujah but a
lot of people miss it because they hold on to the old wine or they hold on to Pride and they miss it but it's easy
it's simple God's love is so great that he wants to release these miracles to you with
ease amen hallelujah praise
God so uh the right way to pray to receive
Miracles is you can you can s for example if you if this is your church or
if you're coming for the first time you understand this is God's way of healing and
delivering so you you pray with understanding understanding this is
God's way so you you're praying understanding that it's not about performative
prayers it's not about ritual type words prayers that I'm saying but
it's simply about believing and submitting adhering to God's ways and
then I'll receive so you can simply pray Lord Lord I am going to your church your
true anointed church and I'm going today to be under the shadow of the anointing
I'm going to the your anointing is going to pour upon me like a waterfall through your servant through your servant of God
through your servant your Apostle for example I believe and I'm coming to receive God I thank you in advance for
healing me today those kinds of prayers God likes because pleasing God to please
God we need to have faith so you're showing faith and you're showing simple
obedience to his ways amen and so you see that was that's
the simple way to pray and then you come and you receive you don't have to be praying for
hours and hours in a loud voice dramatically that's not going to affect
you know like okay God's like okay now I'll release the healing it doesn't work that way' you don't have to add on
fasting to try to move God's heart now there are some cases with extreme
demonic oppression where fasting is important because when you fast with the leading of the Holy Spirit it makes the
flesh to die more and the spirit to rise so sometimes in preparation but it's not
always it's not like a rule like if you need Deliverance you need to fast before you come to the church that's not a rule
no but if if you have severe demonic oppression and or God is leading
you holy spirit is leading you to fast before coming do that in preparation but
it's you're not fasting to get something you're not fasting Lord let me show you with
performance that that that you should heal me you know that's what many people
think their they think their performance of rituals um moves the heart of God but
it's faith and obedience that move the heart of God and God already wants to heal you so you don't really have to
like move your his heart to get healing and deliverance you just got to go according to his ways
amen hallelujah so um so yeah your fasting
isn't to try to get God to do something it's having to do with making your flesh diminish so the demons have less of a
hold amen Hallelujah
so now I want to I want to teach on
um I want to teach On th this th this um
fact right here that there are different different kinds of prayers in the
Kingdom there's a Prayer by the servant of God like servant of God like five-fold
Minister I mean and then there's prayers of the citizens those who are not five-fold
ministers but are citizens in the kingdom and those prayers are
different um and by that I mean um when you look at the children of
Israel they were crying out and praying for
deliverance and God heard their prayers but the but but their prayers didn't
like directly lead to their Deliverance happening like we prayed and then boom
there the Deliverance came but their prayers LED God to do things his kingdom
way of bringing Deliverance God heard their prayers and
he loved them and he saw that they wanted
him they they you know they their hearts were towards him through their prayers
so God because he loves them and saw their hearts were towards towards him he
then finds Moses and anoints
him and sends him to deliver the
Israelites that's God's way of bringing healing and
deliverance but many people don't realize this they think it's their prayers directly bring the
Deliverance when God hears my prayers enough when he sees me fasting enough that will bring the Deliverance no your
prayers for deliverance needing Deliverance needing healing shows God that you want
him opens the door for him to come in power and touch you but he does it
by WR raising up a servant anointing them and sending them to deliver
you hallelujah praise God and so that's why
it's so important that people receive the move of God receive Revival receive
the servants that God has raised up because he has already answered so many
people people's prayers but they're not going to the place to receive them where
they will receive them it's like if people were to not accept
Moses the Deliverance is easily there all of the mighty power of God is in
Moses to to turn the heart of pharaoh to open the Waters of the Red
Sea to provide food in the wilderness
but you have to accept God's ways you have to accept his servant to receive
that Deliverance provision the Miracles the
protection the promised land
amen it's amazing how I'm teaching on this series and this amazing miracle
happened this week that's a great testimony and picture picture of what God is teaching
in this series last month in October I went to a
Sight and Sound show for the first time Sight and Sound is a theater that puts
on I think only biblical musicals stories from the Bible I went in
Pennsylvania and in Lancaster in October and I saw Daniel the show Daniel
and um when I was there as as soon as I got there throughout the show and
especially after I felt the heart of God so
strongly the heart of God to touch his people in power that were there that day
I felt that so many people there because I was among probably a couple thousand or so if I had to guess and I and and I
believe most of them were believers and I felt that so many of them had not experienced the god of power of Miracles
that we were hearing about and watching in this show of Daniel do these signs
and wonders in the fiery furnace and the Lion's Den in the king's
hearts and I felt this burning in my heart from God for these people
thousands of Believers here their eyes to open up and for them to be set free many people I could sense needed
deliverance and I felt this um when the show ended I felt such a passion to minister to the people now the people
were leaving they they were leaving you know but I just felt this this passion so much and it was from the Holy Spirit
and I just said a simple prayer as I was sitting in my seat I just remained seated for a few minutes I just said a
simple prayer I don't remember exactly the words but something like Lord let Revival come to this theater to the
people in this to the people that were here today and let them be set free and let their eyes open May their eyes open
up something like that very simple and um then I got up to leave and
they had people in The Prayer Ministry like if anyone needed prayer after they had people standing in the front and so
the one young man as I'm leaving he he says God bless you you all I was with my
parents in John tall I say God bless you it's was amazing and he says
Apostle Catherine he recognized me and glory to God he shared that he saw a
video years ago that popped up of of mine of 5f on his social media page and
that opened up his eyes to God's power and the reality of Deliverance and it
led to him being set free glory to God and so anyways um turns out I found
out on Thanksgiving day that he that young man and told
the the main um he told the actor who was playing Daniel that night that I was
there and so I received this email that I didn't see until Thanksgiving and this is the email this
is this is from the actor who played Daniel he says I have a praise report to share with you and your ministry my wife
and I work at Sight and Sound Theaters and we have been praying for breakthrough Miracles and for Revival to
take place in the company and Ministry and for the audiences to receive of more than a show but to experience God in a
tangible way my friend was doing after show Ministry and told us afterwards
that you attended the performance I happened to go in that night play Daniel
because my parents were in town and I am one of the four men who cover this role it has been a blessing but hard season
navigating this role and I have been crying out to God for more to see him show up and do what he longs to do and
last week I had never experienced that level of focus determination emotion
creativity and presence I feel that I have been battling a stronghold in my
mind and soul regarding my identity in Christ and feeling like I am not enough to do this but last week those shackles
fell off praise
God I don't know if you brought a spirit of breakthrough into that theater or you
simply prayed for us before the show started and through that simple prayer power was released because Deliverance
took place and for that I am grateful so grateful my heart is at peace and so is
my mind Katherine kman had a gift of faith and that is what I believe you have maybe it was that gift that opened
the heavens in that theater and it was because you showed up and brought the power with you God bless you and your
ministry glory to God glory to God
hallelujah and I had made a post um on Thanksgiving just that I sharing that I
that I went to the theater just of pictures from the theater and stuff and that led his mother-in-law to comment
and she shared this he said um that the the actor who played Daniel he says she
says that that was her son-in-law he heard you were there but he didn't know this information during the show he said
it made sense after he found out because he said the spirit of the Lord was the strongest it it had ever been during a
performance he said the presence of God was tangible that
day um you must you must have she says mantled I think she means like released
impartation to him that day because he has been seeing signs and wonders since that day people are getting delivered
people are getting delivered and God even restored his the
actor who played Daniel his sight to 2020 Miracles are
happening praise God and he shared more than he shared I
wish I could tell the details of that night and what took place during that performance I remember not being able to
talk while walking off stage after act one because of the presence of
God there was a burning within me that took place that night and there was something different about that show
thank you for all that you do for your ministry I believe Faith made a difference being in the
audience glory to God [Applause]
hallelujah glory to God and um you know he he actually had
follows 5f he follows this ministry and so he was he loves this
ministry and he was open you know and so in the spiritual Realm
he was already you know doing things God's way of receiving I mean of of of um going of
accepting God's servants you know you know not just
praying God deliver me and that's it but also accepting God's
servants you see and so most times
it most times the the bulk of the Miracles that will take place are going to happen as people come to 5f church as
they for example five church as an example but it anywhere where God's anointing is a church where God's
anointing is or they you come online or you come to like a flourish conference or a Revival is now
event or you watch a live stream you position yourself there under the shadow most Mo that's going to be most of the
times where these great Miracles are going to take place amen but then there can be other things
that happen sometimes such as this example you know where he didn't come
like to the church in person but he had accepted in his heart me as a servant of
God this anointing and so the Miracles could easily happen when the shadow came over
him when the shadow of anointing came over him you
see Hallelujah but this is such a powerful
miracle for God to do this week as I'm teaching this you know because imagine
he had been struggling for a while praying for a while to to have
this breakthrough and deliverance but it happened when the shadow of anointing extended over him
you see glory to God glory to God
hallelujah thank you Jesus for what you have done spreading this
revival wow praise God thank you
Lord so um I want to show you some examples of this in the word Mark
11:23 it says I assure you and most solemnly say to you whoever says to this mountain be lifted up now wait let's
slow down don't miss this Jesus says to his disciples I assure you and most
solemnly say to you whoever says to this mountain be lifted up and thrown into
the sea and does not doubt it in in his heart in God's unlimited
power so in other words you have to have that childlike faith of this anointing you carry that
the kingdom of God is backing you when you speak so as you speak and
you believe with faith that the kingdom of God government is backing you up as
you walk in your Dominion but believes that he says it's going to take place it will be done for
him in accordance with God's will for this reason I telling you whatever
things you ask for in prayer in accordance with God's will believe
with confident trust childlike faith that you have received them and they
will be given to you Hallelujah so this we can apply for for
everyone for citizens in the Kingdom but you have to make sure you're going
according to God's ways you're positioning yourself under the anointing to receive what you are praying for and
asked for amen but we also apply this to Servants of God I'm teaching now how
Servants of God pray so this is instruction to the disciples how Servants of God pray speak to the
mountain use the authority that has been given to you God has released God has released anointing two servants of God
he has put high level authority to in these Servants of God so
that when they declare things when they declare demons to go when they declare sickness must go when they declare
Revival must spread when they declare the mountain to move it must take
place because these things are God's will for the small exception of things
that are Mysteries right like there's Mysteries
like some people die younger than we think they should have right but they were they were amazing people good
Hearts right sometimes someone is is very very old but sickness is what leads
to them passing away right they don't just die peacefully in their sleep or
anything there's Mysteries like that that there there's that's just how it is there's Mysteries that's the part that's
according to God's will but we know that it's a main principle that the sick shall be healed that the oppressed shall
be free that God wants this to happen for his people
so so we walk in that faith we we we we command the demons to go we command the
sickness to go and we have faith that it will happen there might be once in a
while it doesn't but that's when it's the God's will part a mystery of God part amen but it's our job to walk in
that Faith like a child trusting that God's going to move and he does every
time when it's according to his will every time he moves amen
Hallelujah so you know um a a lot of this is the old wine this is the old
wine and we're getting out of this in the body of Christ there's different levels
of old wine there's remnants of old wine in some people maybe they're walking in
un Walking In Miracles but they're still remnants of of old wine because it's a process it's
really a process that God does to bring this new wine and beautify the bride
amen and so one of the remnants of this old wine is for Servants of God thinking
that they need to really like pray with so much like effort to
get the anointing to move this is old wine actually
because we we don't see you know listen to the scripture I just read it says nothing about praying like
for hours that the anointing would come the thing is is that when God has
really called you when God has called a servant of God he has put that anointing
there and it is there in them it's not something that the servant of God has to
pray to to come in for every service it is in them it is in them when they go
for leisure to see a musical for example it's just there and it just
keeps on growing Acts 3:6 says but Peter said
silver and gold I do not have but what I do have I give to you in the name
Authority power of Jesus Christ the nazare I love this Amplified Amplified
says after name it says Authority power so that means it's not in the name of
Jesus in a religious way it's not this is the secret password that makes the demon to go the miracle to happen but in
parenthesis this Amplified version did a good job describing giving Revelation
new wine Revelation it really means in the authority and power of Jesus
so that's why that's why like a servant of God doesn't have to always say like
demon go in Jesus name like sometimes if they just say and I do this sometimes demon go be healed they are doing it the
truth is in their heart and in the spiritual realm they are doing it in the authority and in the power of Jesus and
so it doesn't have to be religiously spoken it's the truth it's the heart
it's the faith of what that servant of God is walking in so it
says it says in the name Authority power of Jesus Christ of Nazarene begin now to
walk and go on walking so this was someone who was lame all right and so
Peter sees him and he doesn't say wait a second I'll be back in a half
an hour I have to cry out to God to give me extra anointing to heal you right now
and he goes Lord please heal this man I don't please don't let me down I really
want to see him healed give me anointing give me more anointing I'm going to need
more for this kind of Miracle oh Jesus shik po this
anointing you know we don't see him doing that he says I have
this what I do have I give to
you so what I already have what I have childlike Faith confidence in that I
have in me I give to
you so that's the difference between Lord move this mountain please
Lord put your anointing on this mountain move it Lord that's difference between
that and mountain
move you see hallelujah
hallelujah so yeah like when I come to minister here I don't have to spend
hours in this religious prayer to get God to move in
power this is how it is for Servants of God
we we know that God has sent us he has called us he has put anointing he has put Authority he has given us this
assignment and so when like when I'm standing here when I'm ministering I know that God has sent me to do this God
wants this to happen he sent me to do it he's given me the power to do it the
strength to do it the grace to do it and so therefore it simply must
happen there's not a question to it
when when you're in obedience to God you know I'm in obedience to God I'm surrendered I'm not doing wrong things
you know I God has given me the anointing he's sent me to do this it's going to take place I know Miracles are
going to take place today I know the oppressed will be set free I know the sick will be healed I know God will do
so many miracles I don't even know all the Miracles he's going to do he's going to do a lot though he's going to do a lot of Miracles for people watching
online I I have that Faith before I come to minister and as I'm ministering rather
than before I Minister oh Lord don't let me down oh Lord I want to see people be
healed and delivered today oh Lord anoint me pour more anointing for more
anointing so you can do more miracles through me today God it's up to God when he wants to
release like higher levels but I know that what he's called me to do today he's giving me what I need
already
amen so it's not it's not um religious
prayers of me that makes more anointing come and miracles take
place it's not prayers of you for God or
more anointing on Apostle Katherine today you
know that that's not what makes the the Miracles to take place just the same as me doing that isn't what makes it take
place and it's not it's not the music that might bust some
bubbles that like some parts of the old wine but it's not like if we have the
music right then the anointing will come more
I remember in the park when the demons started manifesting for the first time it was Jean tall and I that was it it
was me trying to play piano with my couple of years of piano lessons from
being a kid so I was very beginner and um I obviously couldn't
play like soaking music chords as I'm praying for people so and we didn't
didn't know how to set up I don't know we didn't know how to set set up a track or anything back then in the beginning
so it was just silent I would preach and then it was silent as I went
up to pray to pray after person person after person and guess when the first
demon manifested it was silent actually it was ironically it was the opposite of
having this soaking beautiful music sound because that day we're in the
public park and there was a socializing party happening 10 ft away
and the people were angry that we were having Church by them and they were blasting heavy metal
music so the first time the demon manifested and was cast out at fivefold
church there was heavy metal music playing and no soaking music
silence on our end I love that God did it he was introducing his new wine he
was introducing teaching his ways immediately with the first demon being cast out so like when you know and then
but it's good to have music the music is like Excellence it's like it's good to
have music it but it's it's like Excellence because it helps people to not be distracted someone coughs baby cries it
doesn't sound so loud and distracting if there's music playing amen and music is
beautiful it's from God what is played with a heart anointed heart amen so it's
music's a good thing we want music it it it brings Excellence but it's not making the anointing to come
more amen hallelujah so really it's not it's not
like um oh maybe if we all worship then God will then decide to come
no we're we're touching his heart when we all worship we're touching his
heart we're we're we're exalting him but in when it comes to God's ways
of releasing Miracles it's simply he anoints a
servant and the servant carries that anointing and they have it and they release it like Peter said I give to you
that's how it happened the only thing the only um uh the only thing that can
affect whether Miracles take place or not when an when there's an anointed servant of God there ministering is
Faith first of all remember the servant of God has to have the childlike Faith you believe in your heart that what you
said will happen so there has to be the childlike faith of the servant of God but also the
faith of the people because remember the only time time Jesus could not do many miracles was because of lack of
faith amen so that's the only Factor faith we don't have to get nervous when
there's a technical difficulty in the piano is not making sounds
yet I don't need to be sweating because I didn't do religious prayers before
coming to minister amen praise
God it says in Acts 125 so Peter was kept in prison but
fervent and persistent prayer for him was being made to God by the
church this is when Peter was in prison he was being persecuted for preaching
Jesus and so the Believers were praying fervently and persistently the very night before Herod
was to bring him forward Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers bound with two chains and
sentries were in front of the door guarding the prison suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared beside him and the
light Shone in the cell the angel struck Peter's side and awakened him saying get up quickly and the chains fell off his
hands praise God the angel said to him prepare yourself and strap on your sandals to
get ready for whatever may happen and he did so then the angel told him put on your robe and follow me and the gates
ended up just opening supernaturally and he was let three the
Angels helped him praise God so we're going to fast forward now to verse 12 it
says when he realized what had happened you know that the Angels set him free um
he he went to the house of Mary the mother of John who was also called Mark where many Believers were gathered
together and were praying continually and had been praying all night when we
knocked at the door of the Gateway a servant girl named Roa came to answer
recognizing Peter's voice in Her Joy she failed to open the gate but ran in and
announced that Peter was standing in front of the Gateway they said to her you are out of your mind but she kept
insisting that it was so they kept saying it is his Angel but meanwhile
Peter continued knocking and when they opened the door and saw him they were completely
amazed praise God so uh I want to teach you now because
we're understanding prayers and what prayers do and how we are to pray all
right and so in the old wine this scripture came can be interpreted a
certain way it can be interpreted like because the Believers were praying
consistently and fervently all night God then decided he would let Peter
free he would open up the prison doors but that's actually not what
happened that's old wine remember what I've been teaching
this whole time okay servant of God when they are obedient to
God the kingdom of of God government is automatically backing them up is
automatically moving on their behalf when they're having issues they
are there to help them when they need things when they need certain things
doors open the kingdom of God government is there to make it happen to open up
doors to release what they need okay so Peter he's in the prison but he he knows
I am in God's assignment for my life I am doing what he has called me to
do and he's given me everything that I need and I am obedient Peter knows this
so Peter knows that the kingdom of God government has to back him up simply
simply because he's a servant of God this is what is needed to happen so
Peter isn't like oh boy I hope the Believers are
praying let me text them all pray pray pray pray pray pray tell
all your friends and family to pray if enough prayers go up maybe God's heart
will be moved to open up the door no Peter knew
simply God's kingdom government will back me up I will get out of here
because God has given me an assignment to do and in order to do that assignment
I got to break out of the prison simply
amen and so um for the Believers to pray that was a good thing that was a good
thing God wants that God wants that but it's more he wants it not because he
needs the prayers for him to then be able to move like his his hands are tied
you understand no rather he wants the people to be in line with God's
heart when their leader is in need he doesn't want the people to be like oh
God's got him I'm gonna go about my life you know God does want them to have the
faith God's Got him that's what I'm teaching you God
does want you to have that Faith so that you're not like full of worry or something or going into old wine
religion mode like I have to pray so much religiously he wants you to have
that faith God has got our leader God is going to do a miracle for our leader God
is going to open up the doors for our leader
but he want and so he wants you to pray but in that way of having com being in
line with God's heart having love for for your leader you know having
compassion um and having that desire in your heart God's
desire so so you pray so you pray thank
you God thank you God for opening up the doors thank you God for doing these Miracles thank you God for being with
your servant our leader for example you know but it's not like oh
God do this for our do this do this please God do this open the doors please
God begging you see and you can do it it's okay to with emotions it's okay to have
emotions it's okay to pray with tears sometimes you know that's okay but what God wants to see is
faith faith an understanding of his ways
amen
hallelujah so um so going back to Moses the Israelites
they're praying to be delivered so what does God do he raises up his servant he
anoints the servant he gives the servant Moses all that he needs to do all of
these things that are needed to get them delivered right but imagine the people are crying and praying for
deliverance um meanwhile Moses is is asking
God lord how can I do this I Stu her you know he appeared to him the
burning bush and he's having this conversation with god at the same time
that people are praying for deliverance so I just share that Insight that for
you to know like when people are praying when you are praying
uh lukewarm churches they're praying for for Freedom the people there they're
praying for Freedom they're praying for healing they're praying for miracles to happen God meanwhile was in the process
of answering their prayers by raising up a servant so he was in that process people are like people are thinking they
need to add things they need to add fasting or or something to try to move God's heart more or something but God is
hearing and he is already moving and it is just a process and it is taking time
and and and and you need to have your eyes open and ready to receive the
Deliverance when God releases it be ready for for God to release it through a
servant amen instead of keep on praying keep on praying keep on
praying Hallelujah so we we find today um in today's
time people had been praying for Revival in America and
Beyond people have been praying and praying for generations and those were good prayers it was like prayers of the
Israelites those were good prayers those were those were spiritual prayers not like religious prayers those were good
prayers that God wanted them to pray and so God heard the prayers actually my
spiritual father Prophet Jord Davy he he prophesied that God sent him from his
home in Tanzania East Africa to Los Angeles in
2016 I was me uh or 2016 I went attended a conference he was ministering at um at
at 2016 is actually when I saw him Minister for the first time he prophesied to me I was called to be an
apostle but then I I hosted him at a conference in La at our church it was
like the launching of our church services on Sundays actually when we we had a different name
we weren't five church at the time we had a different name and when he came that time so this was 2017 he said God
sent me from Tanzania East Africa to Los Angeles California America for this
reason the main reason wasn't actually to minister to the people that day that was part of the reason yes but the main
reason was this to prophesy this word to the people of
America in the world but starting with America and that was this God has heard
your prayers in America for Revival God has heard them and he has
answered them now now God is pouring Apostles and
Prophets starting here in America that will be
anointed and be be spearheading leading this revival that God has
brought that will spread from LA to Across the US and across the whole world
and nothing I repeat nothing can stop this move of God it's a new thing that
is coming these were his words I think pretty much were almost word for word
this and he he and he is a true prophet of God you know them by their fruits so
if you don't know who he is if you don't want to take my word for it you can look at fruits you can the Bible says you
know that that that the fruit has to come from a good tree a good fruit has to come from a good tree so for for
example me as a spiritual daughter if you see me as good fruit you have to know that it's come from a good tree
then therefore a true tree therefore a true prop ET so anyways this is a true
prophet of God who spoke those words these words were not just for our
church these words were not just for the city of of La these words were not just
for the charismatic Christians those who are open to Deliverance Ministry and the
apostolic and prophetic this prophecy was for for the entire body of Christ in
America and Beyond the whole
world true prophecy True Word of
God I'm telling you God I I I know this with all of my heart God wanted and
still wants all of his Believers in America all of his all of his leaders in
America and the world to accept this
prophecy it it's like Moses coming and saying God has sent me to you to deliver
you God sent this prophecy through the servant of God like that true words of
God that was meant for a group of people for all of God's people because that's
God's ways that many choose to ignore and everybody wants to hear God their own way but God has a way of speaking
corporately to the whole body of Christ and that's through true prophets specifically General
prophets amen so that word
was like like he truly even said so now Revival is
here okay now at that that time like from that word I kept
declaring Revival is now that's where that started from that prophecy every week um and it would be three and a half
years from that Prophecy Before the first demon manifested and then we saw
Revival breakout but Revival truly began you know just like the Israelites the
Israelites were stuck in Egypt for a little bit but Revival was there they
deliverer was there God was in the process he was doing signs and wonders sure they hadn't
seen their Deliverance yet but the signs and wonders had begun the signs and wonders that
happened in Egypt Hallelujah and so God was doing wonders
before we saw what we considered Revival to be when Revival broke out in 2021
amen and and he he continues to show himself prove himself that this prophecy
is true that Revival is now and this and Prophet Jordy he said it's no longer the
time to pray for [Music]
Revival because Revival is now here it's like Moses comes and you're like Lord
Deliver us it's like you know you're you're passing through out of Egypt and
you're saying God deliver me send me to the promis land it's happening why why
what do you you're praying without understanding and you're wasting
time and so um what and and and and this
subject is a really long one so I'm going to go more in depth even next week
amen so we'll we'll learn more on this next week but just to about what I'm about to share but I'm going to share
next week you know how to pray intercessor prayers how to pray you know
not just for yourself but for others for your children um how to pray for Revival
for your church you know how to pray outside of yourself for things for God
to move in people's lives and in Revival I'm going to be teaching on that next week but um to start out with to start
out with I want to share that you know people praying this people people
they were praying for Revival for America and it started out in a good way in a holy spirit good way but
honestly God has answered those prayers and so it is not spiritual to
pray for Revival anymore it's now time to accept the Revival that God brought accept the
Servants of God leading the Revival accept all things that are a part of
this Revival the prophetic the apostolic the Deliverance Ministry the persecution that comes with
it it's now time to accept it not just accept it not just watch from afar but
dive into it to catch the wave of Revival and be a part of the Revival so
God can raise you up to be a powerful anointed vessel of God Revival
Warrior so that the revival can keep growing and reach the ends of the
Earth but people they were praying for Revival they're they were praying for Revival praying Revival praying for
Revival and they find they' they have big conferences they have many people coming praying for Revival so they in
they end up institutionalizing it and they keep making prayer
conferences praying for Revival and other types of organizations
or things praying for Revival but God has answered and so this is why it's so
important to really grab hold of the new wine and let go the old wine this is why
it's so important to pray the Jesus way because you could be doing something so
religious that's institutionalized that's not led by the
spirit wasting time waste delaying your purpose missing
out on receiving from God missing out on diving into the Revival and receiving all of the mer Les that come with the
Revival and being a powerful vessel of God fulfilling your purpose
amen hallelujah so it's time
now it's time now to fully dive in see the seriousness of being all the way in
the new wine of praying the Jesus
way of of of Discerning this is Old Line This is religious I'm no longer going to
do this I might have been doing this for a long time I might a lot of my friends
are doing this still and believe in this still but I choose to surrender to Jesus
I choose to do things the Jesus way not the old wine way the Jesus way
hallelujah amen praise God
hallelujah thank you Jesus so get excited get ready for next
week where I'm going to be sharing more about how to pray the Jesus way and I encourage you to meditate on
this word this week get it in you this new wine is not going to come
immediately you got to get it in you amen meditate on it renew your mind with
it Hallelujah
