50:30
of the worship team has just gotten back yesterday from Minneapolis, Minnesota, where God moved so powerfully at Revival
50:38
is now Minneapolis. Wow. We I'm in awe. I'm speechless of
50:44
what he did. The devil was is angry at what God is doing.
50:50
But nothing could stop nothing could stop God's plans for his people to touch
50:56
his people, to deliver his people, to heal his people. And so we saw the victory of Jesus amidst opposition. We
51:02
saw victory. And we saw God move so powerfully at this event. Wow. Um, we
51:10
have a video we're going to show right now uh to show some of what God did.
51:18
Receive this anointing now. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
51:24
Receive this anointing now. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
51:33
Receive this freedom now. Total freedom now. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Receive
51:40
this anointing.
51:47
[Music]
51:55
Complete healing and freedom in Jesus name. And I release right now this
52:01
anointing upon you all. The anointing to spread revival.
52:07
May this anointing fill you now. May miracles take place through you now.
52:15
I declare every spirit that has held you back like this demonic weight upon you,
52:21
I declare must go from you now. You are not the same. You are changed forever by
52:27
this anointing that has just been poured upon your life. This is real.
52:33
Hallelujah. Glory to God. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
52:40
Jesus moved so powerfully. He delivered and healed so many. He released impartation. People were set on fire all
52:48
around as you can see all around the building, the theater. Praise Jesus. And
52:53
Christine is going to share a little testimony of what she witnessed.
53:03
Yes. So the power of God was so mighty. Like we were I was in the back so I
53:09
didn't hear like the protesters that were out and I could not hear anything they were saying but I could feel the
53:16
power of God, the fire of God come upon me so strong. And then when I went out I
53:21
just could like you could feel his his love, his power and that he was like
53:26
greater than all the opposition that was happening. Nothing can stop this work of God. Nothing can ever change what God is
53:34
doing. And so I was like so consumed by his love and just seeing the people all
53:40
over the place being delivered, baptized when you release the anointing. They were baptized in the Holy Spirit and
53:46
like tangibly just like shaking by the power of God. It was so beautiful to see
53:51
and witness and it's just amazing. And yeah, praise God. Praise God.
53:59
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And Steve.
54:12
Yeah. So, the devil lost real a lot. Yeah. He lost bad.
54:18
Um, yeah. Despite the persecution and despite people yelling against, you
54:25
know, against Apostle Katherine and trying to stop what was going on, people remained hungry for Jesus
54:32
and they just praised louder and that was really incredible. Um,
54:40
there was one gentleman in particular that really really touched my heart as he was getting touched by Jesus. He was
54:46
in the middle of the just right in the middle and uh he was just yelling almost
54:52
like the whole time during ministry like thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus. And he
54:57
was like he was like you know apostles talked about you know putting your hands up and receiving the ball catching it.
55:04
And this man was catching like everything.
55:11
And um he uh there was one particular time where uh Apostle was ministering
55:17
and commanding like the the words that have been spoken against you, saying that you're like not good enough, uh
55:24
that you weren't wanted, these word curses. And this man was just visibly getting touched. And he was just is like
55:31
he was going down to the ground practically and you could see him just being touched by Jesus and he's like,
55:37
"Thank you. I receive it." Or he's like, "Thank you, Jesus." And it it really
55:42
touched my heart so much to see him cuz it it looked like he might have had a
55:47
hard life and been through a lot of things uh where the devil just had a lot of chains around him and those chains
55:53
were just getting broken off. [Applause] [Music]
56:00
That's my testimony. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
56:07
What the enemy intended for harm, God uses for our good. Always, always, always, always, always.
56:15
Um, I remember like this this past spring when there was persecution.
56:21
What the joke is on the devil because really it put a a greater fire in this
56:29
revival army and all of you here and across the world. And I saw this this
56:34
army rise up like if there was any kind of like slouching or sitting down before
56:42
maybe alertly sitting down There was a rising up
56:47
and a getting into position, standing strong and tall, taking a stand
56:55
with Jesus. And it's like the the army. I saw the revival army here in LA and
57:00
across the world rise up, level up, and because and get serious about the
57:07
father's business. Because whenever you see persecution, what you're doing is you're what's happening is you're seeing
57:13
the devil getting serious about his business. I mean, he's always serious about his business, but sometimes we're
57:20
not aware of how serious he is about his business. Like, until you are anointed and now
57:28
you're a threat. And so then you get to see the seriousness of the devil towards
57:34
the devil's business because you're such a threat. He starts to get real serious about trying to stop you. You know what
57:39
I'm saying? And so that that that can be a blessing to go it can is a great
57:47
blessing to go through that fire to go to have your eyes open up to see how the devil means serious about his business
57:53
because we love our Jesus so much and we want to be about his business. We want
57:59
his will to be done. Amen. And so sometimes it can be like a wakeup call
58:04
like, "Oh, I need to do more for God. If the devil's this serious about his business, I better get more serious
58:11
about the father's business." Amen. Hallelujah.
58:16
So, and and so like it was a similar thing that took place um this at this
58:22
event where like I saw the people there rise up. I saw I mean when I first came
58:30
I there was there was protesters who came in and um I didn't even know that
58:35
they were there as I came out because and they might have been yelling. I don't know. But the people in the
58:42
congregation, they were so on fire. They were all standing up. They were so on fire. They were so hungry.
58:49
It's like instantly when they saw that there was like the an attack of the
58:54
enemy trying to stop them from receiving, they were like, "Uh-uh. Nothing can stop what God has planned
59:01
for me. Nothing can stop God's work from going forth. Nothing can stop all of the
59:08
people here, the people I've brought from receiving." I could see that fire
59:13
come come in them. And when I first came out and I said and I just welcomed everyone I was it was the most I mean it
59:21
was just so much fire so much hunger I was in awe like hallelujah these people
59:27
are ready to receive and it overpowered I didn't even know at that point it
59:32
overpowered the the devil's voice hallelujah
59:38
so what the enemy intended for harm God turned for good and then we saw God move so powerfully
59:44
Hallelujah. Delivering so many people. Praise God. We thank you Jesus for the victory for victory upon victory. Amen.
59:53
Hallelujah. Um we I want to invite to this up here
1:00:00
right now one of our visitors that's here today from Japan.
1:00:06
Yes. Can you come? [Applause]
1:00:22
Hi, welcome. Come. Come here. Would you like to share
1:00:27

1:00:53
then I didn't know how to plant that to this church and then that this year in

1:01:19
a Pentecost church and then they usually that cast out the demons who who is a

1:01:41

1:01:50
try it and then I and then she asked me to cast out and then I I did what you
1:01:57

1:02:04
announc denounced and then I denounced what she
1:02:10
said. I said and then I I what you say I get out from her and then immediately
1:02:18

1:02:24

1:02:59

1:03:31
your heart. It doesn't come to anybody but because of your heart. That impartation came
1:03:39
mightily through the screen from across the world. And God wants to use you in
1:03:45
even greater ways. And he's brought you here today to receive more of this
1:03:50
impartation of anointing so you can set the captives free in Japan. And God is
1:03:56
going to use you to spread this revival in Japan. Hallelujah.
1:04:03
I release more of this anointing upon you now. May this anointing increase in
1:04:08
you and may the captives be set free through you. May Jesus use you
1:04:13
powerfully to spread this revival and spread this good news in Jesus' name.
1:04:20
Amen. Hallelujah. And I speak now I I I speak I detach all
1:04:27
of them from all these things. I break every generational curse and I declare every spirit attached to what you've
1:04:34
renounced for these people. I declare your family. I declare all must go from them. And I speak total freedom upon
1:04:42
them now in Jesus name. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. God is proud of you.
1:04:50
I am proud of you. God is so proud of you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:04:57
Praise God. Praise God. Wow. Jesus. This impartation of anointing is real.
1:05:04
And she received that by watching online. This is real. Isn't that powerful?
1:05:12
That that you can be a vessel of the anointing. It It is not just for me. It
1:05:18
is not just for me. It is for me to pass to you, to release to you.
1:05:24
God wants to use you like this. If you haven't seen my message from a few weeks ago, what was the title? Anyone
1:05:30
remember? It was for pastors and ministers. a prophetic message for pastors and ministers who need
1:05:37
anointing. It was something like that. I I don't know the title off the top of my head. Anyone remember it? You're all
1:05:43
looking. It's some I just want you to be able to search it if you haven't seen it
1:05:48
already. I teach you how to receive this impartation because it doesn't happen any old way, but God wants this for you
1:05:56
to receive this. Amen. Hallelujah. Yes. Thank you, Shane. for those called to
1:06:02
ministry. That's the title of it. For those called to ministry.
1:06:08
Prophetic word for those called to ministry. Yes. From a few weeks ago. I have a message. Um and I just heard this
1:06:15
powerful testimony as well from one of our 5F church family uh from Sweden.
1:06:20
He's planted at 5F Church and he's received impartation of anointing. And I he he he testified in Swedish and I and
1:06:27
I and I believe he will hopefully testify in English too. So you can hear, we'll play it here, but um he testified
1:06:33
recently about how uh he there was these people who were in such bondage. This
1:06:39
one guy just this supernaturally demonic thing happened to him where it felt like there
1:06:46
was cigarette smoke coming in his face constantly, but it wasn't. But it was completely demonic. But he was so
1:06:52
tormented by it that it was starting to mess with his mind so much and bring depression. And so many people prayed
1:06:58
for him and nothing happened. Actually, people prayed for him one time in a church and actually got worse because it's the anointing that destroys the
1:07:05
yoke. It's not just prayer. It's prayer with anointing with true anointing. It's
1:07:10
the anointing that destroys the yoke, not simply any kind of prayer. Amen. And
1:07:15
so he prayed for him and he was set free completely. Completely.
1:07:21
So and and and I can't remember off the top of my head. This is just spontaneously I'm sharing this with you.
1:07:27
So I don't remember all the details of the testimony. I just watched it last night but there was even other bondage I don't remember now. So I just shared it
1:07:33
on my story yesterday. Um but I just shared this with you to know that like this is real.
1:07:40
Like this is not just for you to come and see me who carries anointing and receive it um for miracles in your life
1:07:48
but it's for you to receive impartation of anointing. you. This is God's plan for you to receive impartation of this
1:07:55
anointing to be an anointed vessel of God. Amen.
1:08:01
This is your calling. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. This revival is spreading.
1:08:08
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Um, there's also
1:08:14
another testimony. Uh Jessica from San Francisco, can you come up?
1:08:21
And Daenerys, if he if you can come next, if you can come to the stage,
1:08:28
Daenera from the Bay Area. Hi. Hi.
1:08:35
Face to face. Face to face. Praise God. Would you like to share your testimony? Yes. Um
1:08:43
wow. Okay. So, I've uh been a Christian for almost 10
1:08:49
years now. And a little over five years ago, uh my daughter was removed from my
1:08:56
custody. She was abused and had broken bones. Uh it's the hardest thing I've
1:09:02
ever gone through in my entire life. And the only thing that got me through was
1:09:07
Jesus, for sure. Um, and from that point forward, I was
1:09:14
seeking God. Like I I knew I wanted more. I w I every day it was like, God,
1:09:20
I want to know more of who you are. I want to see more of who you are. I want to be used by you. And I didn't know
1:09:27
what that was going to look like or how that was how my prayer was going to be answered until about eight months ago
1:09:33
when Dinara actually shared with me about 5F Church and you and um I ended
1:09:41
up coming to my first service in November and then I went to Flourish Dallas in December and I went there with
1:09:50
um hesitation with doubt and Right after the impartation session, I was touched
1:09:57
by God in a way that I've never been touched before and such power. And immediately I testified
1:10:04
about just how God had freed me from um like doubt and judgment. And I you
1:10:12
shared with shared that testimony on your um social media, but I want to
1:10:18
share what God did after that because it was just so much more. So um
1:10:24
in the in the deliverance session you were ask encouraging us to renounce more
1:10:30
and I was talking to God and I was like God I renounced everything I don't know what else to renounce and then out of
1:10:36
nowhere he's like you need to renounce this sultai and I didn't know what a sultai was but I just was obedient was
1:10:43
like okay everything to do with you know what happened with my daughter that relationship I I I renounced that and
1:10:52
immed immediately felt God touched me again in such great power and um went
1:10:58
home and about two weeks later I got about 50 text messages nonstop just like
1:11:05
you're ter terrible like it's all your fault um if you die I don't care and
1:11:11
just from watching your teachings um I knew that was the enemy attacking
1:11:16
and trying to to make me doubt what I had received and I renounced that and
1:11:23
about two weeks after that I got an apology text message from this person. I was completely shocked. Um, and then 2
1:11:30
weeks after that, I was watching a service in the Bay Area from home, so through the screen. And you were you
1:11:37
were praying for someone over there, another mo single mother with two children, and you were praying for them
1:11:44
to just to have courage that that God was protecting them and that the enemy
1:11:51
was never going to get to them again. And I'm sitting on the couch and just out of nowhere just broke down into huge
1:11:59
sobs. Like heartfelt sobs. I felt so much heat. And I just knew it was God
1:12:05
continuing to deliver me from this fear of this um attachment that I had in this
1:12:11
relationship. And um he opened up my eyes to see that like to have compassion for this person
1:12:18
who has been treating me and my daughter like this that he's in bondage himself and and to pray for him and um and so I
1:12:28
have been but I just I so since everything that has happened with my daughter and how I'm living now, it's
1:12:35
like I'm I'm not striving anymore. I'm not trying to make things happen on my
1:12:41
own. like I trust God and who he says he is and I can just rest that he's taking
1:12:47
care of me and my family and it's it feels so good to be in that place.
1:12:55
Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Thank you for sharing. Praise God.
1:13:04
And Daener from the Bay Area. So, so you're the one that told her
1:13:10
about Amazing. You want to share your testimony? Uh, yeah. Um, hi. Hi. I'm from Bay Area.
1:13:18
Um, I'm a friend of Jessica's. Um, so I got planted at Five Church a year ago,
1:13:23
last June. And, um, I came to Flourish Conference and, um, Dallas conference.
1:13:30
Jesus freed me from loneliness that I had since I remember I was 14 years old
1:13:36
and I was just feeling so lonely. I didn't know what it was at 14 years old. I was just like numb myself watching TV,
1:13:43
listening to music. And I remember this pain in my heart. Pain would go away as
1:13:49
I watch TV and listen to music. But I knew it was there. And when I came to
1:13:54
flourish conference um like that voice said I'm going to
1:14:00
stay. This is not leaving leaving you. This is yours. You're going to keep it. But then Jesus came in power. Uh I think
1:14:07
it was last impartation session and he just came and he um asked for my hand. I
1:14:13
gave my hand and we started walking together and he like he removed that loneliness and he showed me how that was
1:14:20
a pattern in my life that led me to um different relationships like bad relationships and I would stay in this
1:14:27
relationship because I just I had this like great fear of being alone and just
1:14:32
Jesus just took it away and I felt so free and I realized at that moment that that what it mean what that's what it
1:14:39
feels like to be in God's will. Amen. And um my son was freed from
1:14:46
healed from ADHD. It took few weeks but um he had like a hyperactive um ADHD. it
1:14:55
was hard for him to sit still and focus and um since then I think we came last
1:15:01
July and that's when um we were in the crowd when you prayed for people that I know that's that God touched him and
1:15:08
when we went home I noticed slight differences and over the weeks it was like complete change especially in
1:15:15
school he's able to sit and focus his grades improved and his teacher was just
1:15:21
so amazed like what happened to Mason Yes. And like
1:15:28
praise God. And then um she even told me teacher that he helps other children at
1:15:34
school to kind of you know when they feel like nervous or like upset he helps
1:15:40
them to like get back to like normal and feeling themselves. I was like wow. It's
1:15:45
like it's Jesus you know. I wouldn't I would never like expect my son to be able to do that without God's love, the
1:15:53
power. And then um yes, there was a lot of things that God freed me from stagnancy, barrenness. I had this like
1:16:00
procrastination um spirit. I would like now myself with TV like it was an addiction and Jesus
1:16:08
freed me from it. Like I have no desire to watch TV. Like I watch sometimes but like I don't care. I was just like wow.
1:16:16
I was in bondage and I didn't even know it. Um, yes. And I we came to Arise and
1:16:21
Shine with my son, too. And God gave me like more of his anointing. I was just
1:16:27
so on fire. And I I've been talking um I I'm a nurse and I was sharing with
1:16:33
people at work and my patients and um you know, just like I know God wants to
1:16:39
use me there at my workplace. Um yeah, and just I've been praying. God was
1:16:44
giving me more and more boldness as I watch your teachings. Like I never miss
1:16:50
um Sunday service. Every live stream I'm there if I'm able to. And God is just so
1:16:55
faithful. He's so good. Um yeah, praise God. Hallelujah.
1:17:03
Thank you for sharing. Wow. Praise God. Hallelujah.
1:17:10
Wow. Jesus, revival is truly now. Amen.
1:17:15
Praise God. Thank you, Jesus. Well, I want to
1:17:20

1:17:40
[Music] It's an island country in Polynia, part of Ocean Oceania.
1:17:47
The country has 171 islands of which 45 are inhabited. That's some information
1:17:52
about Tonga. So, welcome to our 5F Church family in Tonga and from 38
1:17:59
nations. All of these nations and states. These are all of our new 5F church family from the past week. That's
1:18:04
where they're from. Praise God. Praise God. So now we have 5F church family in
1:18:11
162 nations. Glory to God. Welcome everyone who has joined us this past
1:18:16
week and come into the family. We are excited for what God is going to do in your life now that you are planted and
1:18:23
you will receive abundant life, a covering of protection and go glory to glory. Amen.
1:18:30
Hallelujah. And if you would like to be planted at 5Furch, you can go to the link in my bio or 5fchurch.org/planted
1:18:35
org/planted for those of you watching online. Praise God. Hallelujah.
1:18:41
Revival's growing. Amen.
1:18:48
Praise God. Well, we're going to get into the message right now. Are you ready for the word of God?
1:18:54
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
1:18:59
Proverbs 29:18 it says, "Where there is no vision, the
1:19:04
people perish." Where there is no vision, the people perish.
1:19:10
There's something God is going to do today. He is directing you into your calling.
1:19:17
Hallelujah. Today, your eyes will open up, will begin to open up to see your divine
1:19:25
assignment on this earth. Praise God. Hallelujah.
1:19:31
And without a vision, without knowing your assignment, without knowing the
1:19:36
direction of where you're supposed to go, of what you are supposed to be doing each day, each week, you'll perish.
1:19:44
Without vision, the people perish. Perish meaning you will you can perish spiritually. You you perish meaning you
1:19:51
will not be walking in abundant life. you will not be having peace and joy and contentment because part of the
1:19:58
contentment that Jesus brings is when we are in his will and obeying him.
1:20:04
That's a big part of the contentment that Jesus brings. Part of the contentment that Jesus brings, the peace
1:20:10
that surpasses all understanding is being in relationship with him.
1:20:16
Knowing that he's always with you and loves you, and having a true relationship with him every day.
1:20:22
Amen. Amen. Knowing that he's protecting you and that his plans for you are good. That is part of what brings that
1:20:28
contentment that you can't get anywhere else in the world. That's part of what brings that peace that surpasses all
1:20:34
understanding that never leaves in any circumstance. But that's part that's just part of
1:20:41
where the contentment comes. The other part of the the contentment how to have full contentment is when you are walking
1:20:49
in God's will. That full contentment will not come just
1:20:54
by prayer and reading the word but not being obedient to God in every area of
1:21:01
your life. You have to walk in obedience. You have to be fulfilling your purpose. That is
1:21:08
where this contentment and peace and joy, full contentment and peace and joy comes. Amen.
1:21:14
Hallelujah. Every one of you has a purpose on this earth. And if you are here, if you are
1:21:21
here in this place, I'm telling you that God's calling for your life is to be a
1:21:27
warrior in his end time revival army. It is his will for your life to be a
1:21:35
messenger of this good news of Jesus Christ and this prophetic good news.
1:21:41
this good news that revival is now. Not a a gospel of religiousness, a
1:21:49
gospel that carries no power. Gospel means good news, by the way, but true
1:21:55
good news, the full gospel, the full gospel of Jesus Christ that he has come
1:22:01
in power to save and heal and deliver. And he can take away every yoke of the
1:22:08
devil and bring you into abundant life and peace and joy. Hallelujah. This good
1:22:14
news. This is the good this is this is your calling to carry this good news to the
1:22:21
world. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:22:27
But every one of you has a specific assignment in this revival.
1:22:36
You each have a specific assignment. Some of you haven't discovered what that
1:22:42
is yet. It is time now to discover what your assignment is.
1:22:47
Amen. Hallelujah. So today you're going to learn how to
1:22:53
dis how to discover what your personal divine assignment is from God.
1:22:59
Hallelujah. God has a vision over this church in
1:23:04
this revival. And this vision is that everything that has been lost that we
1:23:10
see in the book of Acts, the way that God wanted church to be and how a
1:23:15
believer's life should look like for all that was lost to be restored.
1:23:22
for God's power to be restored, for it to be not optional or rare or or obscure
1:23:27
to find a church where God's power is, but that it would be a must because the
1:23:33
kingdom of God is not a matter of talk, but of power. Amen.
1:23:39
This is what God is doing in his revival now. He's restoring his anointing. He's also restoring the other aspects that
1:23:46
have been lost in the book of Acts like the five-fold ministry. The apostles and prophets by and large have been lost. He
1:23:51
is restoring them. He is restoring these ministries that are so vital to have the
1:23:57
power of God in the church that are so vital to have the equipping
1:24:03
that's needed for all believers to be truly victorious over the devil, have
1:24:08
their spiritual eyes open up to know the devil's schemes and to receive impartation and know how to walk in the
1:24:15
anointing effectively. to have that kind of equipping, we need
1:24:20
the foundation, the apostles and the prophets. Ephesians 2:20, the the the
1:24:25
the foundation is the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus as the chief cornerstone.
1:24:31
Amen. So God is restoring the five-fold the power of God. He is restoring the
1:24:36
five-fold ministry. And with with this he is restoring the ministry of
1:24:41
deliverance and healing [Applause]
1:24:47
so that all who would come to the church and all believers who go out in the world
1:24:53
would be able to deliver the people who are oppressed. Everyone who comes to the church, the
1:24:59
demons can't stay. The yolks must be destroyed. This is what God is restoring. This is his vision. I'm
1:25:06
sharing with you God's vision for this revival, for this church.
1:25:13
His vision that this good news, the full gospel would go out to the ends of the earth, to every corner of the earth, to
1:25:19
every nation, tribe, and tongue. That people's eyes would open up to see
1:25:25
who he really is. That he comes in power to save, heal, and deliver.
1:25:30
Hallelujah. And that his power would be demonstrated. and his power would be
1:25:36
released. Eyes would open up as the power of God was demonstrated. Like Paul
1:25:41
said, I came to you not with wise and persuasive words, but I came to you demonstrating the power of God so that
1:25:48
your faith would no longer rest on wise words, man's words for it. You should believe in Jesus, but no power, but that
1:25:55
your your faith would rest on God's power. You would see yourself. You would
1:26:00
taste yourself. You would experience yourself. You would encounter Jesus yourself. And that's how the faith would
1:26:06
come and the faith would be real. The faith would be standing strong. It would last
1:26:12
because you've seen, tasted, experienced truly encounter Jesus rather than just hearing about Jesus.
1:26:20
Hallelujah. Praise God. This is God's vision that
1:26:26
that that that that that the church would be transformed, reformed,
1:26:32
drastically, radically to look like the book of Acts.
1:26:40
This is God's vision. It's God's vision that every believer would be equipped
1:26:46
and mature like how it speaks of in Ephesians 4:1-16. that God gave the five-fold ministry, apostles, prophets,
1:26:52
evangelists, pastors, and teachers for this purpose, to equip the believers so that they would no longer be immature.
1:26:58
They would no longer be tossed to and fro by the devil, by doctrines of the devil, by religion, but rather they
1:27:05
would be equipped and mature to have victory over the enemy and to do the works of God themselves, to do the works
1:27:12
of ministry themselves, to be powerful vessels of God themselves to help other people. This is God's vision that
1:27:18
believers would no longer be lukewarm baby Christians beaten up by the devil
1:27:23
having no clue about the spiritual principles and the secrets of the kingdom which is in the scripture.
1:27:29
There's script a scripture I read in Minneapolis that that where where Jesus it's right in the time when Jesus is
1:27:34
saying uh blessed are you who see that because there are people there are
1:27:39
Pharisees there are people who have eyes but they do not see they have ears but they do not hear but blessed are you who
1:27:44
who see the secrets of the kingdom have not been revealed to them but they've been revealed to you this is in
1:27:50
scripture is that it literally says the secrets of the kingdom and so it's God's vision
1:27:56
that all believers their eyes would open up to know the secrets of the kingdom
1:28:02
that deeper things, the the principles of the spiritual realm. There are principles in the kingdom of God.
1:28:09
There's a way that God does things, not just any old way. How we feel, what tradition does, what your your mom did,
1:28:15
what your dad did, what your grandfather did, what their church did. God has his ways. God has order.
1:28:24
And so the revival we're seeing here, these these testimonies of impartation,
1:28:29
it's because the secrets of the kingdom of God have been have been revealed here.
1:28:36
Hallelujah. That's the reason why demons go quickly here because the secrets of the kingdom have have been revealed
1:28:42
here. It's God's will that the secrets of the kingdom would be revealed to the whole body of Christ.
1:28:48
But it's up to the people to humble themselves, to be pure in heart, so their eyes can open up to see the
1:28:54
secrets that they're missing. Hallelujah. But this is what God is doing now. And it is growing. It is
1:29:00
grow. It is is coming. It's not all at one time. It's not immediate. It's not as fast as we would want it to be. But
1:29:07
he is moving every day to open up eye after eye after eye
1:29:12
to see these secrets of the kingdom. To see this good news that revival is now and that it's not for you to just watch
1:29:19
online and say, "Praise God, someone set free." But you too can come be set free.
1:29:24
You too can receive anointing and cast a demon out of somebody too. Hallelujah.
1:29:31
Hallelujah. This is God's vision for revival. And this is God's vision for this church.
1:29:38
It's God's vision that this transformation would happen in the whole body of Christ. It's God's vision that
1:29:43
what five of church looks like would be in every church in the world.
1:29:49
By that I mean God's power is moving. By that I mean demons are being cast out. People are being set free. People
1:29:55
are being healed. People are receiving impartation of anointing. People are being baptized in the Holy Spirit.
1:30:00
People are People are actually surrendering their lives to Jesus. actually surrendering, not just saying a
1:30:07
repeat after me prayer and living lukewarm and a double life, but they're actually giving their lives, laying down
1:30:13
their lives for Jesus. They're actually being transformed into the image of Jesus. They're actually becoming
1:30:19
selfless, having servant hearts, becoming pure in heart and humble and truly Christlike. That's what's
1:30:26
happening at 5F Church. Glory to God. I don't just speak this. I'm speaking
1:30:31
the testimonies that have been shared over years now. You, many of you here, you've been
1:30:37
transformed to be like Jesus, to be more like Jesus. You still have ways to go. Some of you, yes, but you've become more
1:30:44
like Jesus. You've become more selfless, more servant-hearted, more pure, more humble.
1:30:49
Is that anybody here? Hallelujah. Praise God.
1:30:55
That's what I mean when I say what's happening at Five Church, God wants to do in every church. I I I say this
1:31:01
humbly. I'm just I'm celebrating what God is doing here.
1:31:07
The miracles, the transformation that's happening here. Glory to God. Oh,
1:31:12
glory to God. He wants this to be in every church. People have free will. It's not a
1:31:19
forceful thing. But as we carry this good news and shine our lights and be
1:31:24
the example, one by one by one, people are drawn to that light. One by one by
1:31:31
one, believers are transformed, pastors are transformed,
1:31:37
churches are transformed, new churches begin and become more examples.
1:31:45
Hallelujah. Praise God. God's vision in this revival
1:31:51
and for 5F church is that there would be a great expansion, a greater expansion,
1:31:57
a much greater expansion. His vision for 5F church is that we would grow so big
1:32:03
that we would have to move out of this place and go to a bigger venue and in
1:32:08
time grow to a bigger venue than that. His vision is for people to flock all
1:32:15
around the world. Even more people are traveling every single week. Glory to God. Like today we have I think four at
1:32:21
least four or maybe five nations people have traveled to come here today. In Minneapolis people traveled from eight
1:32:27
different nations. This is happening every week. But this is small compared to what God has in store.
1:32:35
God's vision, God's vision is for so many more to flock all around the world
1:32:40
to receive here so that they can receive this impartation and go out to their
1:32:46
cities and nations and churches and their ministries if they have a ministry and carry this fire
1:32:53
to come and receive here like a well to be equipped and to receive more impartation so that they can be
1:33:01
stronger, their fire can be stronger. revival can grow more in their city and their nation. It's God's vision for the
1:33:09
millions of the people that live in LA for for many more of them than currently
1:33:15
to be here with us every Sunday to be saved to come into the kingdom to
1:33:22
be healed and set free and walk in their purpose. This is God's vision for LA
1:33:29
that we would grow and grow and grow and grow. It's God's vision that many more people
1:33:36
must hear this good news and see our light and come into the
1:33:43
kingdom. Amen. Hallelujah. Here in LA and all over the world, this
1:33:50
is God's vision. It's God's vision that many more apostles and prophets would rise up. He
1:33:57
would call and he would anoint so that more equipping can take place
1:34:03
all over the world and in different churches. For 5F Church, it's God's
1:34:08
vision that we would have many branches all over the world. And these small groups that have begun, there's about 40
1:34:14
now. It's God's vision that that that they would become branches
1:34:20
in his perfect timing. Hallelujah. His vision is so massive.
1:34:29
This vision he has is so bright, so exciting, so beautiful, so glorious.
1:34:38
So much more even of heaven coming to this earth. So much more even of God's
1:34:43
kingdom at hand. So many more people coming into the
1:34:48
kingdom. So many more miracles. So more many many more testimonies. So many more miracles that we haven't even heard of
1:34:54
yet. So many more people being risen from the dead. Hallelujah. So many more
1:34:59
signs and wonders. And it's God's vision that the work of
1:35:05
God would go forth with excellence. people in the world, people who have successful businesses,
1:35:12
they are successful because they are people of excellence. They have chosen to work hard. They have chosen to do
1:35:20
things with seriousness and excellence with no compromise.
1:35:25
They have chosen to sacrifice a lot. If you see any successful people,
1:35:30
successful businesses and such, if you think about like Apple and Amazon and
1:35:36
all these big companies, they didn't get there by being lazy. They didn't get there by doing things halfway.
1:35:45
They didn't do get there by being uh uh by by by not giving their all and making
1:35:52
such a sacrifice. How much more should it be for the work
1:35:58
of God? People they they put they pour their heart and soul blood blood, sweat and
1:36:05
tears to these companies to these products to these to this vision and idea that they have such as the iPhone
1:36:12
or something where it comes with so much success. And now most people have an
1:36:17
iPhone, you know, but they're they're pouring their whole lives into it.
1:36:22
They're pouring their heart into it. They believe in that vision. They care about that vision. But they're doing it
1:36:28
so that they can have their own personal success. So that they can have fame, they can
1:36:34
have riches, they can be notable, they can have a sense of purpose.
1:36:42
How much more should it be for the kingdom? How much more should we should we devote
1:36:50
ourselves to God's work? Our
1:36:56
love for God should be greater than like these people's love for themselves and love for success.
1:37:04
Our love should be greater and stronger. And if you will make the choice to surrender your life to Jesus, God will
1:37:11
transform your heart and make your heart more
1:37:16
your your love for Jesus more powerful and stronger than people's love for
1:37:22
success and money and fame. That leads to that truly leads to such great success.
1:37:31
So what I'm saying is if we would devote ourselves more, surrender ourselves more to God and pour our heart, pour our
1:37:39
soul, blood, sweat, and tears, pour our lives into the work of God
1:37:46
into being servants of our master to fulfill his vision. How successful could
1:37:52
the kingdom of God be? How excellent
1:37:58
could the work of God be on this earth? How massive could revival grow
1:38:11
with God helping us.
1:38:16
People in the world have this kind of success bring this kind of excellence
1:38:24
and they they need luck. They need connections. They need giftings. They need money. But
1:38:31
God's power trumps all those things. God's favor trumps all those things.
1:38:38
We don't even need all the things that successful people in the world need.
1:38:43
What I'm trying to say is God is calling all of you, all of us to devote
1:38:50
ourselves to fulfill God's vision. And it's big. It's massive.
1:38:56
But it's bigger than an iPhone. It's bigger than Amazon.
1:39:03
It's bigger. But it it it takes something to get to
1:39:09
get to see that big vision accomplished. But with God, all we need is to lay down
1:39:15
our lives, devote ourselves to God and God's anointing
1:39:23
and God's hand upon our lives and that's it.
1:39:28
You we don't need anything else. God will do the rest.
1:39:37
So it's not even it's actually much more simpler, much more restful,
1:39:43
much easier than the success in the world.
1:39:48
We don't need luck. We don't need connections. We don't need a resume. We
1:39:54
don't need to be a genius. We don't need tons of money.
1:40:03
When we serve God, when we give our all to God, God will provide all of those things. But it'll be God that's doing
1:40:09
it. Hallelujah.
1:40:15
Hallelujah. Praise God. So, this is a it's a prophetic message here today that that
1:40:21
that there is a massive vision that God has for you, for us, for this church,
1:40:27
for this revival. But we can't just sit back and wait for
1:40:33
the wait for it to be fulfilled. We have to do our part. We are the servants. He's the master. He has the vision. He
1:40:40
has the plan. But we are the ones that bring it forth with his help, with his power. It doesn't happen without us doing our
1:40:46
part, without us devoting ourselves to fulfill God's vision. Amen.
1:40:53
Hallelujah. [Applause]
1:41:05
So God God has created you for a purpose and you don't have to wait. Some of you
1:41:12
are even young here. Some of you are going to you're you're finding out you're finding out your purpose right now. You're finding out your purpose
1:41:17
right now. You don't have to wait. There there may be other things revealed later
1:41:22
on that that that that brings you into like the fullness of your calling, the
1:41:27
fullness of walking in your purpose of why you were created. But the majority of it, the bulk of it, you can know
1:41:34
right now. It's what I've just shared with you right now. It's spreading the good news of the full gospel of Jesus
1:41:40
Christ, the true gospel. Spreading it. spreading it
1:41:47
and healing the sick and casting out demons. But it doesn't necessarily have to mean
1:41:52
that you personally every day need to heal the sick personally and casting out demons. But it means that you need to
1:41:58
devote yourself to the work of God where people are being set free from demons and being healed and being risen from
1:42:06
the dead. You know, it's not it's not the kind of
1:42:11
thing like like this is all of our calling to preach to preach the good news to preach that the kingdom of God is at hand. The kingdom of heaven is at
1:42:17
hand. It is here. Heaven has come. You can live heaven on earth life. You don't
1:42:24
have to be in shackles by the devil anymore. Hallelujah. And to heal the sick and to cast out
1:42:30
demons and to raise the dead. That's all of our callings. But it's not like every single one of us just goes out and says, "Oh, okay. Hey, I need to find people to
1:42:36
cast demons out today. It the the revelation really of this is that every
1:42:43
single one of you, every single one of us must devote our lives to seeing this
1:42:48
vision of God accomplished, to see the work of God, of the preaching of the gospel, of the healing of the sick, of
1:42:54
the casting out of demons, of the raising of the dead, of the equipping of the believers. To see that happen,
1:43:00
devote ourselves to make that work of God go forth. to devote ourselves to make sure the work of God is going forth
1:43:06
with excellence. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. So, this is all of your
1:43:13
callings and you can you can start right now. You you don't necessarily need you
1:43:19
don't need like this prophecy of like your part to play in this. But what I'm telling you today is you have a specific
1:43:26
part to play, a unique individual assignment in this revival. If you are
1:43:33
here at 5 Church, if you're planted here at 5F Church, you have an you have an an assignment from God to help accomplish
1:43:41
this vision. You have an individual divine assignment. You do. you you you
1:43:48
have your own and it's time to step into that.
1:43:56
My people perish because of lack. My people perish when when there is no vision. When there's no vision, my the pe when there is no vision, the people
1:44:02
will perish. So now it's time to have the vision. First I shared with you this
1:44:08
is God's vision. But you also need to have the vision that God has for you
1:44:13
within God's vision. You you need to know what your
1:44:19
assignment unique assignment from God is. So how will you know that?
1:44:28
Psalms 37:23, the Lord directs the steps of the godly.
1:44:36
He delights in every detail of their lives. Though they stumble, they will never
1:44:43
fall. For the Lord holds them by the hand. Once I was young and now I am old.
1:44:49
Yet I have never seen the godly abandoned or their children begging for
1:44:55
bread. Hallelujah. This says, "The Lord directs the steps
1:45:02
of the godly. He delights in every detail of their lives." Hallelujah.
1:45:12
The Lord directs your steps. What is If you if you love Jesus and you have given
1:45:19
your life to him and you are doing your best to walk in obedience each day, I
1:45:24
say to you now, the Lord directs your steps.
1:45:32
The Lord directs your steps.
1:45:38
He is directing your steps. The Lord delights in every detail of your life.
1:45:46
He knows about every detail of your life. He delights in it. He delights in
1:45:53
in guiding your steps. He delights in in in you walking in his will. He delights
1:45:58
in seeing you be used as a vessel of him to bring forth his to help bring forth
1:46:05
his vision. Hallelujah.
1:46:11
So first first of all you need to have some godly confidence right now
1:46:19
that God is and is going to be directing your steps to reveal to show you to make
1:46:29
it known your individual assignment
1:46:34
your part to play when it comes to knowing what your
1:46:40
assignment is. Sometimes it can come through a prophecy and it comes like what? I never would
1:46:48
have guessed that. That was me. If I had to guess my divine assignment, it was to
1:46:54
be a Christian singer. But that wasn't it at all. I never had
1:46:59
any kind of uh feeling that I was going to be a minister.
1:47:05
But a prophecy came forth from my life that I was called to be an apostle.
1:47:10
So sometimes the assignment, the individual assignment can come through a prophecy,
1:47:16
but not always. If not the prophecy, it is coming by the
1:47:22
Holy Spirit who lives in you, directing your steps and revealing to
1:47:29
you moment by moment, day by day, revealing to you more. I want you to do
1:47:35
this now. I want you to do this now. I now want to use you in this way. The
1:47:41
Holy Spirit will speak to you. You will feel if you feel this pull to
1:47:50
do something for God and it aligns with the new wine. It
1:47:55
aligns with order. It has to align with order. Like for example, God has order.
1:48:01
So right now, for example, it's time for you to hear the word of God right now. It's time for all the people to hear the
1:48:08
word of God. Nothing else right now in this exact moment.
1:48:15
So if someone all of a sudden sitting here feels this urge to prophesy
1:48:22
something all of a sudden in the middle right now in the middle of the message that's not God.
1:48:31
Oh but I feel I need to prophesy that something good. It can be even something
1:48:36
good like Jesus loves you. There's someone here that needs to know that Jesus hasn't forgotten about you. It can
1:48:42
be something truly good and beautiful, but it can be the angel of light, the
1:48:48
devil masquerading himself as an angel of light to try to bring disruption and take get
1:48:56
have people distracted from the word of God. So that's what I mean by God has
1:49:02
order. And I'm just giving you a little teaching. And I have many more teachings
1:49:08
of this in a playlist on my YouTube called God's order. I also have a
1:49:14
playlist called uh hearing God's voice or relationship with God is is called
1:49:19
relationship with God and there are going to be teachings on that playlist on my YouTube that share how to hear
1:49:26
God's voice. So, um, there's also a religion, what's
1:49:32
freedom from religion playlist, and there you will learn how to make sure you're not being deceived by the devil
1:49:39
masquerading himself as an angel of light. So, I have these playlists there for a reason. They're very important.
1:49:45
They're having to do with hearing God's voice, being free of religion, and
1:49:50
walking in wisdom and God's order. Amen. So, I definitely encourage you to go
1:49:56
check this out because I'm sharing with you today, what I'm sharing with you today is that you need to hear the Holy
1:50:02
Spirit speaking to you specifically, to you personally. And so, I I I really
1:50:10
advise you to look at those messages to make sure you're that that you're not being confused by any other voices or
1:50:16
your own personal desires. Amen. So, but back to what I was saying, when
1:50:22
you when you feel this pull to do something for God and it's in
1:50:29
align with his vision, the vision I shared and it's in it's in line with
1:50:35
God's order and you know that it's not out of
1:50:40
selfish ambition to do this thing. It's not like you feel this pull to do
1:50:46
something because you want people to see you as spiritually important
1:50:53
or you feel this pull to do something because it'll be it's like a performative religion performance.
1:50:58
Performative is performative a word? Performative. Performative religion.
1:51:04
Religious action. Amen. So, as long as you know it is not
1:51:10
in a selfish motive and it's in God's order, when you feel a pull to do something for God, aligning with his
1:51:17
vision, that's an indicator God is revealing to you your assignment. He's
1:51:22
revealing to you more of what he's wanting you specifically to do in this
1:51:27
revival. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:51:35
Proverbs uh 12:15 it says, "The way of the arrogant fool who rejects God's
1:51:42
wisdom is right in his own eyes, but a wise and prudent man is he who listens
1:51:48
to counsel. The way of the arrogant fool who rejects
1:51:55
God's wisdom is right in his own eyes, but a wise and prudent man is he who listens to counsel." So when it comes to
1:52:02
discovering what your part to play in this revival is your individual assignment,
1:52:09
God is going to be speaking to you. The Holy Spirit is going to be speaking to you. But how you hear the Holy Spirit's voice
1:52:16
comes with having wisdom. How does wisdom come? This verse says by
1:52:22
listening to counsel. In other words, by being planted where
1:52:27
God has called you to be planted. and listening to the counsel, listening to the teachings, being a disciple of
1:52:34
the teachings. These teachings equip you, give you wisdom, impart wisdom to
1:52:40
you, open up your spiritual eyes. This is really who God is. This is these
1:52:45
are his ways. This is his character. These are the ways of the kingdom. Oh, this was religion, but this is new wine.
1:52:52
The understanding of the new wine. So as you hear the teachings and be and
1:52:59
meditate on the teachings and apply the teachings and be a true disciple, you literally are having your spiritual
1:53:06
eyes open up each day. You literally are being cleaned from all the wrong
1:53:12
doctrine, from religious old wine doctrine, from the wrong doctrines of
1:53:18
how to hear God's voice and you actually were being deceived by the angel of light.
1:53:24
Through these teachings, there's a cleaning of the wrong things that got you deceived and confused.
1:53:31
And there's a pouring in of anointed true spiritual food.
1:53:38
There's a pouring in of wisdom that opens your spiritual eyes, opens up your
1:53:44
spiritual ears. So now you can really be hearing the Holy Spirit.
1:53:51
If the devil ever tries to come as the angel of light, you know it and you reject it and you won't be
1:53:58
confused or deceived because you positioned yourself to receive wisdom.
1:54:07
That's how you'll be able to know this aligns with God's vision. This is truly the Holy Spirit because
1:54:13
it's not out of religion I'm doing this and it's not having to do the motive isn't for my like selfish gain.
1:54:21
By being a disciple of the teachings, that's how this wisdom will come to you where you can really be hearing the Holy
1:54:28
Spirit's voice every day and he can guide you. You will you will be confident. This is my assignment. This
1:54:35
is my assignment here. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:54:45
So your assignment has to be doing with spreading this good news. And this is a
1:54:53
big part of your assignment like more than ever right now in this year of acceptance. I've been sharing
1:55:00
recently how the harvest is ripe, how God has been preparing hearts and it is
1:55:06
time for laborers to go out there and bring the harvest. Amen. It's prophetic timing. There was a
1:55:13
hunger for flyers. We had so many flyers made. We have flyers every week now and
1:55:18
they're being all used up. I heard 800 were distributed by some of our 5F church family here. Um yesterday, was it
1:55:26
just yesterday? Just yesterday. Yesterday alone 800
1:55:33
were spread out individually passing to people putting places to Oh, you're
1:55:38
here. I remember see you from the video. Amazing. Hallelujah. Welcome.
1:55:45
Today is going to be a life-changing day for you. God brought you here. He sent them. He sent them to bring you here
1:55:52
and touch you and change your life forever and deliver you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:55:59
But there's people out there who are just waiting to hear the good news. There are people out there that are just waiting to be invited. They don't know.
1:56:06
They have not heard. They do not know it's a couple blocks away, ready for them to receive,
1:56:14
ready for them there. How will they know if people don't go out and spread the good news as the
1:56:22
verse says, if people don't tell them? So, this is the time now more than ever.
1:56:29
And I'm I'm so overjoyed. I've been seeing testimonies online as well from our online 5F church family. Flyers are
1:56:36
being spread out all over the world. I hear test there's one there's a there
1:56:41
Pat and Kelly our 5F church family from Pennsylvania on their car they wrote with a marker revival is now on their
1:56:48
window. 5fchurch.org people are seeing it. They're having conversations. People are hungry and and
1:56:55
and coming hungry to receive now because of how they are how they are hearing
1:57:01
from God doing their individual assignment to spread this good news and be creative. Amen.
1:57:06
Hallelujah. And so many of you I'm so blessed. Thank you. Keep sharing your testimonies. I'm so blessed. I'm so
1:57:12
blessed to see this good news get out there through your words, through your flyers,
1:57:18
through there's another testimony that Marissa shared yesterday. She put she she had a bumper sticker made. Revival
1:57:25
is now fivechurch.org. Somebody saw it. Started a conversation with them. Turns out he's looking for a church.
1:57:32
So, as I shared last week, all of your seeds are leading to a harvest.
1:57:38
All of your seeds God is moving upon. So, spreading this good news with
1:57:45
excellence, with passion, with devotion, with creativity,
1:57:53
Not just going through the motions, but putting your heart and mind into it.
1:57:58
H how can my light shine brighter? How can this How can people's eyes see
1:58:05
better? How can people want to listen more? You know, be creative.
1:58:12
This is a big part of your individual assignment in this revival.
1:58:17
laborers in this harvest that are so needed. Amen. Especially right now. I
1:58:24
mean, it will come a time where it's not like as urgent to do the grassroots
1:58:31
like spreading. I mean, it will always be, but like there will be a time when there's like more media showing,
1:58:40
you know, and that's even how social media is now. But we can't rely only on social media right now. We have to do
1:58:47
more because these videos are going everywhere, but they're not going on every single people's pages. But at the
1:58:53
same time, you can't stop short of doing grass like just word of mouth. You have to don't neglect your social media
1:58:59
because God's using that so powerfully. We got to go to the highways and byways everywhere and put our devotion into
1:59:06
spreading this good news. So part of your individual assignment is spreading this good news and it's going to look
1:59:12
specific for you. like God will like fel uh uh like uh Kelly and Pat were led the
1:59:19
they were led to write that on their car. Marissa was led to put the bumper sticker on like this is part of your
1:59:24
individual assignment. God is going to be speaking to you. Do this. Do this to shine your light to get the good news.
1:59:31
Do this creative thing to get the good news out there to spread the good news.
1:59:36
Amen. Amen. And the second part of your individual assignment
1:59:42
is to use your gifts and your ability abilities and what God has put in your
1:59:50
hands to advance the kingdom because all of us this is all of our I
1:59:57
mean the great commission is to preach the good news. So the good news has to get out there, has to be spoken,
2:00:05
but there's also equipping of the believers that has to take place. There's also a healing of the sick, a
2:00:11
casting out of demons. So you can't only just spread the good news.
2:00:18
You need to be a part of the actual work, too. So it's like inviting people to the
2:00:24
wedding, but serving at the wedding banquet as well. both is your calling. It's all of our
2:00:30
callings. Amen. So, you have to figure out what your
2:00:36
part I mean God Holy Spirit is going to be revealing to you what your part is to play in
2:00:43
the work of God. So, take a look at the gifts God's given
2:00:50
you. God wants to use those gifts for the kingdom.
2:00:58
all of the gifts. Don't overlook some of the gifts.
2:01:05
Like for me, I thought singing was how God wanted to
2:01:11
use me. That's my gift. Let me offer my gift to God and that was good. I did that. But like at the same time, public
2:01:16
speaking was my fear and weakness. But public speaking was like a gift. I just had to get over my fears.
2:01:25
You see what I mean? But I didn't consider it a gift. But I was an actress. I was a singer.
2:01:31
What I mean is like I can be in front of people and I can open up my mouth. You
2:01:37
see what I mean? But I didn't like to use that gift that
2:01:42
I didn't know was a gift or I should say ability. I didn't like to use the ability of public speaking.
2:01:51
I was good with a script. I could memorize. can just go out there, do what I memorized. I don't have to use that
2:01:57
part of the brain of speaking off the cuff or speaking from the heart. You
2:02:02
know what I mean? Same with singing. I didn't have nerves to do that. So, like you you you got to
2:02:10
make sure you're not being just only focusing on your favorite gift or where
2:02:15
you think your best gift is or where um you know, you know, you think that's
2:02:21
really where God wants to use me because maybe you have a great gift of music, but it's not God's timing yet for you to
2:02:28
be on the worship team. Or in my case, it's not God's plan for me to be on the worship team, even though I want I would
2:02:34
want that would that would have been my original desire. Amen. So you have to s
2:02:40
you you have to surrender everything and and look at all of your abilities, all of your gifts, not just the things you
2:02:47
see as gifts, but you what can you do to offer to God? Because maybe God wants to
2:02:53
anoint it like he did for me. Maybe God wants to anoint your ability that you
2:02:58
don't see as a gifting and turn it into a great gift to bless others.
2:03:07
So many of you have abilities. Many of you, there may be some of you where you say, "I don't have any gifts." Maybe that's true. But you all have abilities
2:03:16
that God is planning to anoint and turn into a gift.
2:03:22
I never in a million years would say that public speaking or preaching was a gift I had. Absolutely not.
2:03:28
So if you here are thinking, "I don't have a gift." You're like me in that way.
2:03:34
these abilities that you have, God wants to pour his anointing on and transform into a gift.
2:03:40
So when you when I'm teaching you how to hear the Holy Spirit guiding you of your
2:03:46
individual assignment, what are your gifts and abilities?
2:03:51
And where is the need? Where is there a need
2:03:59
that you could fill that you could help bring more excellence? that you could help take a
2:04:05
burden away as you open your heart to be used by God
2:04:12
in any way and you understand it means this the need where the need is my
2:04:18
abilities giftings you'll hear Holy Spirit guiding you
2:04:24
amen so your your your assignment is having to do with using what God's giving you.
2:04:30
So that's your ability, your abilities, your giftings, your time,
2:04:38
your efforts, and also your finances.
2:04:44
Like the se what he's putting in your hand. There's some people where God has really
2:04:50
blessed them and a big part of their assignment is to pour so much into the kingdom
2:04:56
financially. That's their individual assignment because that's a big gift
2:05:02
that God has personally put to them for the kingdom. Like there's some people,
2:05:08
there's some of you that God gave you
2:05:13
such intelligence more than others. Intelligence in the mind. There's some
2:05:20
of you he's given great gifting. There's some of you he's given this
2:05:27
spirit of hustling, like the spirit of like readiness, the
2:05:35
spirit of working hard, the spirit of urgency and like you
2:05:43
you're a goalgetter. He's given you that spirit. Like it's
2:05:48
like you were born with that or maybe even it had to do with your upbringing. But all of these things, that kind of
2:05:55
spirit, a hard work ethic like that, go-getter, ability to talk to people,
2:06:03
your gifts and or finances. He's given you these things for the
2:06:10
kingdom. He for some of you, he's given you your
2:06:17
intelligence for the kingdom, for the purpose of the kingdom. has nothing to
2:06:22
do with your personal success and your dreams. Same for money. Some of you, you
2:06:28
are so intelligent, you are so gifted and that has brought you so much financial success.
2:06:34
But it the reason God gifted specifically you that is having to do
2:06:40
with your individual assignment to bless the kingdom to advance the kingdom of God.
2:06:48
That's your individual assignment. It's not everybody's. Everybody is called to
2:06:53
tithe. Everybody is called to be generous and allow God to have have his way with their finances.
2:07:00
He's calling everyone for that. But not everyone is at God's will to be blessed.
2:07:05
So financially, but it's yours for those of you that it's you. It's your you have that for
2:07:12
the kingdom. That's your individual assignment to give more than others
2:07:17
because God's blessed you with more. Freely you have been given this freely.
2:07:24
You were given this gift in your mother's womb.
2:07:31
Others were given that gift in their mother's womb. Freely you were given this gift in your mother's womb
2:07:38
to freely give to the kingdom of God. to give back to God.
2:07:47
What is your individual assignment? What has God given you for his kingdom?
2:07:54
You all have more than enough. Not one of you should be thinking that you don't have enough gifts. You don't
2:08:00
have enough ability. You have enough. You have to, some of you need to reject
2:08:06
the lies of the devil bringing insecurity because it's clouding your vision to
2:08:12
see. It's clouding your ability to hear the Holy Spirit voice saying, "I want to use you in this area. This is an ability
2:08:20
I've given you. I want to use you in this."
2:08:25
So to hear the Holy Spirit's voice guiding you about your assignment, you have to make sure you are rejecting the
2:08:31
devil's voice of insecurity and fear and doubt.
2:08:41
Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
2:08:54
And when you start when you start coming to God and praying and coming with this
2:08:59
heart of surrender that I'm talking about, you'll be amazed at how Holy Spirit
2:09:06
starts speaking to you, how he starts guiding you, how he starts revealing to you. I want you to do this. And then you
2:09:13
start doing this. You start being obedient to serve him. And you'll be amazed. He'll reveal something else.
2:09:21
I want you to do this. It's going to keep growing your
2:09:27
assignment. How God reveals how he wants to use you. When you're faithful with little, you
2:09:33
will be faithful with more. So, he's going to start revealing other things. I want you to now do this. And he's going
2:09:39
to give you an ability. And you'll be shocked even the ability that you now have, the gifting you now have.
2:09:46
He's pouring his anointing upon you and he can use you in different ways you
2:09:52
never would have imagined and it will keep increasing.
2:09:58
You will you will do more and more for God. He will entrust you with more and more and you will bring so many more
2:10:04
into the kingdom. You will be more effective for the kingdom. God will use you mightily
2:10:09
in this anointing, in this revival. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
2:10:17
Matthew Matthew 16:24. Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wishes to
2:10:22
follow me as my disciple, he must deny himself, set aside selfish interests,
2:10:29
and take up his cross, expressing a willingness to endure whatever may come,
2:10:35
and follow me, believing in me, conforming to my example in living and
2:10:40
if need be, suffering or perhaps dying because of faith in me."
2:10:48
God is asking for more from all of you. He is asking that you would be more
2:10:54
committed and devoted to your individual assignment to fulfill
2:11:00
God's vision. This is the prophetic word God is
2:11:05
speaking now. He is asking for more. He is asking you to raise the standard higher.
2:11:13
It is prophetic this season we are in the message even from last week. God is
2:11:20
calling you higher to a higher standard. Calling you for more because there's a
2:11:26
great harvest out there that God is ready to bring in. But you need we need to be ready.
2:11:36
We need to be more devoted,
2:11:41
more serious. Amen. Hallelujah.
2:11:50
God is asking for for sacrifice and surrender, total surrender for him.
2:11:57
It's a life of this. It's a life of laying down our lives. It's a life of picking up our cross to serve him. It's
2:12:04
not just one time. It's not just one season of of
2:12:10
sacrifice. And it's so important that we remember
2:12:16
that it's a life that we lay down. It's not a year or four
2:12:24
that we lay down for him. And then we just get to enjoy his blessings.
2:12:31
We just get to enjoy the reward from us sacrificing.
2:12:38
It's a life of surrender. It's a life of sacrifice.
2:12:44
It's a life of devotion to God. It's a life of putting God first. It's a life
2:12:50
of denying ourselves. It's a life of serving others before ourselves. It's a
2:12:56
life of loving others more than ourselves. It's a life of being after
2:13:02
God's heart.
2:13:11
And and it's so important if you've been following Jesus for years, it's if you if you've been following him for a
2:13:16
while, it's so important that you renew your mind to this truth, that you renew your mind to this scripture. Amen.
2:13:23
That in order to be a disciple, to truly be pleasing the father's heart, to truly
2:13:30
be effective in the kingdom of God, to truly be able to walk in the anointing
2:13:35
and increase in the anointing, we have to lay down our lives continually.
2:13:43
We have to continually humble ourselves and see and know that Jesus comes first.
2:13:50
His work is priority. Seek first the kingdom of God and all of
2:13:56
these things will be added. Your life will be so blessed.
2:14:05
But as he blesses you, you need to keep on seeking first the kingdom. And then
2:14:11
he adds more and more blessings. But you need to keep on seeking first
2:14:16
the kingdom. It doesn't stop. You have to keep on making Jesus
2:14:22
priority.
2:14:28
You have to keep on humbling yourself to remember that you are not entitled to
2:14:33
anything. You have to keep renewing your mind to know that Jesus is worthy of my all.
2:14:42
Jesus is worthy of my surrender.
2:14:48
Amen. So, in coming up to a higher standard
2:14:53
that God is calling you to, it's a new level of surrender.
2:15:01
Cuz as God is calling you to be more devoted, that means a sacrifice.
2:15:07
It means putting aside your selfish interests, some of them that you haven't yet,
2:15:14
and put Jesus first. put his work first.
2:15:20
Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
2:15:25
Praise God. Are you ready to go higher for Jesus?
2:15:31
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It's time to see God's vision fulfilled.
2:15:39
It's a big vision. And we won't see it overnight, but it's time to see more of it fulfilled
2:15:45
as we go out and do our part to accomplish it. It's time for this
2:15:51
revival to expand. It's time for more eyes to open up.
2:15:57
It's time for more people to hear this good news and be set free and be healed and be set on fire.
2:16:03
Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
2:16:10
Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
2:16:16

now. Honey, I want to give my testimony. Um, I'm
2:45:37
responding to that call to God to be a servant of God. I am so thankful,
2:45:44
grateful he healed me of lupus and other disorders. I I asked you to
2:45:52
pray for me like almost a year ago that we started coming to the church and um I
2:45:59
have been going through many many doctors and the result has been coming
2:46:05
normal normal even though I got two two
2:46:11
months ago I got removed a very big uh tumor of result of those uh disorders
2:46:20
And um I I just want to serve God. I I am so grateful because it's not easy to
2:46:29
be dealing with so many things and and the doctors, so many drugs and all of that. And and I I want to go I will make
2:46:37
a trip in two weeks to go to I'm from Honduras and I want to to go and pray
2:46:43
for my family that they they can receive healing as well. And I have been
2:46:48
forwarding the the services for them to listen and they are following. My sister
2:46:54
is following you and but I want to bring this revival to them in Honduras. Amen.
2:47:01
Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Praise God for this healing in your life. Thank you Jesus for healing her from lupus.
2:47:08
Thank you Jesus. God is going to use you now in his power to spread this revival and touch the people in Honduras and

beyond. I release this anointing upon you now. May your testimony carry the
2:47:21
power of God so mightily. And may people encounter Jesus through you as you

2:47:36
Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah.
2:47:45
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
2:47:50
Thank you, Jesus. It's time for freedom and healing for every single person here. If you need freedom or healing, it
2:47:57
is Jesus who brings healing and freedom. It is not me. It is not a one-on-one prayer. It is Jesus. So, if you were
2:48:05
healed by a one-on-one prayer, it wasn't the one-on-one prayer. It was Jesus.
2:48:10
If I prayed for you and you were healed, it was not Apostle Catherine that healed you. It was Jesus. It's just that Jesus
2:48:18
has a way of moving in power through vessels. And you have to be a vessel. He
2:48:23
can pour anointing in. You have to be surrendered. So that's why it's not every person that prays things happen.
2:48:30
The anointing must be there. But still, it is only Jesus. It is still only Jesus
2:48:38
that does these miracles. And so it is Jesus doing the miracle in
2:48:44
a one-on-one prayer, but it's also Jesus doing a miracle when a word is declared over all of you.
2:48:50
He is just as powerful. Do not limit God. And do not put your
2:48:57
eyes on man or woman, me. Put your eyes on Jesus. His power is here. Get ready
2:49:05
to receive right now. Lift your hands to Jesus to receive from Jesus. If you need to renounce anything because you have
2:49:11
demonic oppression, renounce it right now. Renounce the specific oppression. Renounce renounce the the open doors
2:49:18
that led to the oppression. This is a key that unlocks your total freedom. If you don't know what this means, it's
2:49:23
important. You you need to renounce specifically the oppression and specifically the open doors of sin, for
2:49:30
example, that led to that oppression. So speak that aloud right now. say, "I renounce
2:49:36
[Music] engaging in this sin," for example, whatever the specific sin was. I I renounce doing witchcraft. I renounce
2:49:43
going to a psychic. Speak it aloud. Renounce it. Thank you, Jesus.
2:49:51
Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Holy Spirit, for what you're about to do right now. Thank you, Holy Spirit, for
2:49:59

2:50:17
