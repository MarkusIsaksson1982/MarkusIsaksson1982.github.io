40:06
way that this revival broke out, how it began was through a 59 second video that

Hi. Wow. C can you share your testimony of
42:38
what happened as you read Secret of the Anointing? Yeah. Um I've struggled with addiction
42:44
and homelessness for the last 14 years. Um I I was um clean. I was a good girl.
42:51
and I was uh working as a nurse and um I was pregnant with identical twins and I
42:57
lost one and um at 6 months and so the identical the surviving twin was born um
43:04
with a lot of medical falities and she's here with me today and disabilities um
43:09
when she was about a year old um her father introduced me to drugs and I
43:15
thought that was like going to like make everything okay and I struggled um on
43:20
and off with very heavy three very heavy drugs. Um and I was homeless. I was
43:26
living underground in Las Vegas in the tunnels. And um I I was clean for like
43:33
two years out of the 14 years. And it was by the grace of God. And my daughter and I we got baptized
43:39
and um and I didn't know what I was doing wrong. I was reading the Bible and
43:45
I was praying, but I was still struggling in a lot of ways. And when I was in jail, I just like completely
43:51
broke down and surrendered to Jesus. And I asked him to um to change my life,
43:57
that I couldn't do this any longer and needed to be with my family and I needed to be with my daughter. And I knew that
44:04
he could do it for me. Um and I told him, I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but please, please bring me an answer.
44:10
and I prayed and I reached out to the chaplain at our jail at um uh it's
44:16
called um Clark County Detention Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. And he and I told
44:22
him I needed like freedom from demonic oppression and things that I was going through. I was going through some very
44:27
heavy things um from people that I was hanging out around um and I was I was
44:33
practicing like astrology and like witchcraft and stuff. And um I've always
44:38
kind of struggled with mental illness. And so I was struggling with like anxiety, depression, um schizophrenia,
44:45
hearing voices. And so um I prayed and the chaplain said, "This is the only
44:51
copy I have, but I'm going to give it to you." And it was your book, The Secret of the Anointing.
44:57
Yeah. Yeah. And it's um it helped me so much. it um
45:05
it opened up my my spiritual eyes to things that I wasn't doing that I needed
45:11
to be doing. And um such as like speaking um uh Jesus's word um the the
45:18
word of God over my life. Um when I would read the word of God, I would pray
45:24
it over myself and my family and it made such an impact. It's made such a difference. I have nine months clean and
45:30
sober. Yeah.
45:35
Yeah. Um there's still things that I do struggle with. Um to be completely honest, I struggle with vaping and like
45:42
alcohol still and um here and there. And so I came today to get completely freed and to also get healing for my daughter.
45:49
Yeah. Amen. And um I watch your videos. Um I also
45:56
like I knew that God was with us all the time, but I didn't really like know it the way that you put it. There's things
46:02
that you um that you explain and it's like like he's with you at all times and
46:08
you need to be aware of his presence with you at all times. No matter what you're at, no matter what you're doing,
46:13
even no matter if you're doing good, bad, whatever, you need to know that he's with you. And that has made a lot of difference for me. Yeah. Thank you,
46:21
Jesus. Amen. Praise God. Wow.
46:27
Hallelujah. I'm looking at you. I knew that God was going to make this happen. Like he had
46:33
um he had let me know that things were going to happen. He he does want me to work in ministry with people um who
46:39
struggle the way that I've struggled. And I've even thought of like names like Rebel Revival for like street ministry
46:46
and stuff. Um uh me and God have talked about a lot of things, but I'm I'm so happy that the day is finally here. I'm
46:52
looking you in the eye. Praise God.

49:45
Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
49:51
Sarah, is it Hi. So, you have come from Guatemala today, have you? Hallelujah. And you
49:58
have come here before. You want to share? Yes, please. Hi. Thank you so much. Uh, it's
50:03
a huge privilege to be here. This is the third time that I've come to 5F Church. I came the first time when you guys were
50:09
still in the park. Um, and I was I was set free of religiosity and then the
50:15
Lord said, "Come back." So then, uh, about six or seven weeks later, I came back. Uh, and then I was imparted to by
50:22
you, apostle, and you, um, stuck out your hand and my head got stuck to your
50:29
hand and we went in a circle. Remember that? Yeah. Glory to God. And so from there, my life was totally changed. Totally
50:36
changed. Um the Lord is so faithful, so good. I'm just in awe and wonder and so
50:42
thankful for you and your ministry, Apostle. And so after receiving that impartation, I had to prove faithful for
50:48
a little while. Uh and then the Lord brought this this amazing thing. I had
50:55
always moved in prophecy, but then after getting imparted to by you, it was just like really expanded. And the Lord
51:01
started to give like prophetic words where I'd walk in the circle just as you imparted to me in a circle and I would
51:07
receive those prophetic words and they were like they're about reforming of the church end times of revival and I'm just
51:14
in a on wonder of Jesus and so thankful and um so we actually came today I'm
51:19
here with my apostolic leaders from the ministry that I'm a part of and I uh and
51:25
we're here today. I just want to share on that too because that's another testimony because of what you said uh when you made the call for all of the
51:32
all the pastors and leaders and you said you know like we need this revival to expand. We need to get out to the you
51:38
know I know you guys are already going to the nations and meeting like meeting millions and millions of people already
51:43
but that but that there's more. Jesus has more and he's calling all the all the pastors. And so, um, my apostolic
51:51
leaders came to Guatemala and they said, um, it was, it was really incredible
51:56
because Suzanne had prophesied that the Lord wants to give us a land. And then you had, um, I had missed one Sunday
52:04
because I'm always listening online and being equipped. I follow you online and I'm seating sometimes into the ministry,
52:10
too, because I've been so blessed by this ministry and I'm so blessed by it. Um, and so Suzanne said, "The Lord says
52:17
he wants to give us the land." And then I tune into 5F and you are speaking about the land and if you humble
52:22
yourself and come and receive from the Lord, he will give you the land, you know, the land, heal the land. And I was
52:28
like, "Oh my goodness, we have to come. We have to come." So I told uh my leaders and they're here today as well.
52:36
And and I'm so thankful to God and I'm so blessed by God and there's a lot that we have to do. There's, you know, the
52:43
Lord is on the move. And since I received the impartation from this church, um, literally the Bible came
52:50
alive in ways I have never ever experienced before. And it's just amazing. And there's more. We need more.
52:57
We need more anointing, more power of God flowing through us. And also just like there's been a lot of a lot of
53:03
witchcraft and and and and warfare and just kind of like more authority so that we can meet the people and people can be
53:09
free. And um and also um if my prayer is
53:14
also if the anointing could be sent to my house so the perfect will of the Lord could be done there. And our um our team
53:20
is all here to receive from you. Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
53:27
Hallelujah. There's going to be a powerful impartation that will take place today.
53:32
I know. Hallelujah. Praise God. Thank you for sharing.
53:38
Praise God. Wow. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Anyone remember her that
53:44
that moment she's talking about? Raise your hand if you remember. That was like a couple years ago, maybe three
53:50
years ago. Wow. I remember it so vividly. And to hear what God did after that from that. Wow. Thank you for
53:58
testifying. Wow. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Wow. Jesus.
54:06
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Revival is surely now. Amen.

55:32
Hallelujah. Um, so I want to welcome everyone who's joined the FFold Church family. We have
55:41
164 new 5F church family members from 25 different states and 45 different nations from around the world. Welcome.
55:49
We are so blessed to have you be part of our fivefold church family. And we are so excited for you because you've
55:56
stepped into revival. You've stepped into a life of abundance and the glory of God. His power is going to be flowing
56:03
over you. And there will be a covering, an anointing of protection as you were planted in his house, in the church.
56:10
Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. Praise God. Well, I'm going
56:16
to get into the word right now. I've titled this message the urgency to spread the good news.
56:30
So in Matthew 22:1 it says,
56:35
"Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables and said, "The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who
56:42
arranged a marriage for his son and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding and they were not
56:49
willing to come." Again he sent out other servants saying,
56:55
"Tell those who are invited, see, I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and fatted
57:01
cattle are killed, and all things are ready. They're ready for you. Come to
57:07
the wedding." But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to
57:14
his business, and the rest seized his servants,
57:19
treating them spitefully, and killed them. So the servants that were just simply
57:25
inviting these people to the wedding got killed
57:32
by the ones invited. Doesn't make sense, does it?
57:40
But when the king heard about it, he was furious and he sent out his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. Then he said to his
57:46
servants, "The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. Therefore, go into the highways, and as
57:54
many as you find, invite to the wedding. So those servants went out into the
58:00
highways and gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good. And the
58:07
wedding hall was filled with guests. So this is a parable that Jesus is
58:13
speaking. He's giving this example to try to teach about what the kingdom of heaven looks like. So what does this
58:21
mean? Well, when Jesus announced that revival had come, when he had when he
58:28
had announced this great news, Luke 4:18, in a synagogue before Jewish
58:35
leaders, he said, "The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to
58:42
proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the
58:48
blind to set the oppressed free to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.
58:55
So as he spoke this, he was announcing this good news. He was announcing that
59:03
you were all invited to the wedding. You are all invited to revival. You are all invited to salvation, to be saved,
59:10
to to be healed, to be free, to have abundant life, to be in relationship with me. Jesus was speaking this when
59:17
he's announcing this. He's announcing this to everyone who is hearing. He's
59:22
inviting them to a wedding in a way because a wedding is an example of joy,
59:31
celebration, heaven on earth, abundant life, right? So Jesus is inviting these people to
59:38
this beautiful life of joy and abundance
59:44
and peace as he spoke this. He's inviting all these people. But you know
59:50
what happens right after Jesus simply invites the people to come and receive,
59:55
announces that revival is now. Come into revival. You know what happens right after that
1:00:01
is that the Jewish leaders that were invited to the wedding, invited to come
1:00:07
into revival and receive, receive healing, freedom, abundant life, and impartation of anointing to be
1:00:13
disciples. They tried to run Jesus off a cliff.
1:00:18
They tried to kill him. Doesn't make sense, does it?
1:00:24
Jesus is simply saying, "The Lord has anointed me to help you, to save you, to
1:00:29
free you, to heal you, to lead you into abundant life, to give you peace, to give you joy, to lead you into a
1:00:36
relationship with me, with God." He's giving the most amazing news in the
1:00:42
world. He's giving it. He's inviting these people to come receive this. And
1:00:48
these people instead of wanting to come and receive, wanting to receive what Jesus was offering them, they instead
1:00:56
want to kill him. This is what Jesus is meaning by the
1:01:01
parable. The Jewish leaders were the first ones invited.
1:01:07
They were they were servants of God. They were doing the work of God. They were invited to the wedding. They
1:01:14
were the wedding guests that were invited. They were supposed to become disciples. They were supposed to receive impartation of anointing and be like all
1:01:21
of the 12 disciples that went out into the world and spread the good news and
1:01:28
began the church, began the spreading of the good news that has lasted thousands
1:01:33
of years later to where we are now. They were supposed to be a part of that. They were supposed to be the first ones up to
1:01:39
do that. I mean, they knew the word of God. They were already servants of God. They just had to step in a different way
1:01:46
that God was doing. Just come this way. That's all they had to do.
1:01:52
They already believed in God. They didn't have to go through um they were already believing.
1:01:58
They were already worshiping God. They were already coming to church. They were already reading the word of God. They were perfect candidates
1:02:05
to come first. They're and actually they are praying for the Messiah. They are they are they
1:02:12
are expectant for this the messiah. They are hungering for the Messiah to come. They are reme reminding people of the
1:02:19
words of the prophets proclaiming the Messiah. So they are the wedding guests
1:02:24
that were supposed to enjoy the wedding.
1:02:29
But not only did they reject that invitation, they tried to kill Jesus right then and there and then even later
1:02:35
they they did. they those Jewish leaders are the ones responsible of Jesus being
1:02:41
crucified. So this is the example of the the parable of the wedding here.
1:02:55
So all of those like leaders or not just leaders but those who were close
1:03:03
followers of the leaders the Jewish leaders none of them attended the wedding meaning none of them joined
1:03:10
Jesus. None of none of them became disciples of Jesus.
1:03:17
Jesus the the first ones to come and receive from Jesus the ones that Jesus could use could say come follow me. They
1:03:23
were the ones that were not that learned of the scriptures.
1:03:28
They were not the ones close to the leaders, Jewish leaders at the time. You
1:03:33
see, so it was the ones who were so
1:03:38
knowledgeable about the word of God who became prideful know-it-alls.
1:03:44
They are the ones that rejected the invitation to be disciples of Jesus, to step into
1:03:51
revival. So that's what the kingdom of heaven is like. That's what the kingdom of heaven
1:03:57
is like today, too. And so in this parable,
1:04:04
the the you know, and the father is doing this for the son, by the way, this is the son's wedding, like Jesus's wedding.
1:04:14
And so the father then says to his servants,
1:04:21
"The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. Therefore, go into the highways and as many as you
1:04:27
find, invite to the wedding." So the father would not accept that this
1:04:35
wedding hall be empty. He would not accept that
1:04:40
the wedding hall must be filled. They had the the father had prepared the
1:04:46
most beautiful wedding, the most delicious food
1:04:51
and anyone who would come there would experience such joy, such abundant life.
1:04:58
And so the father who had a heart for people said, "Bring anybody.
1:05:05
This can't go to waste. Invite anybody. Go into the highways,
1:05:11
the byways. Go anywhere and everywhere to fill this
1:05:17
place. This place must be filled and these people must enjoy what I have prepared.
1:05:31
So in Jesus's time, we have
1:05:36
the ones who joined him, who became disciples. We have Jewish people, but
1:05:42
the ones who were first to come and receive were not the know-it-all Jewish
1:05:48
Jewish people. They were not the first guests, intended
1:05:55
guests. They were the ones that Jesus went out to find and said, "Follow me."
1:06:04
We also have a Roman centurion who believes in Jesus.
1:06:10
We have Samaritans and many other Gentiles,
1:06:16
non-Jewish people that come and receive from Jesus, become disciples, become
1:06:24
revival carriers. So they were the not the first intended
1:06:30
guests, but they were the few that were chosen. Many were called, but they were the few
1:06:37
that were chosen. They were the ones that would accept the invitation.
1:06:48
And so this is what God is speaking now.
1:06:54
This is what God is speaking now in this revival. He's speaking as the father spoke to the
1:07:01
servants. God is speaking to you as his servants.
1:07:06
The original invited guests did not come.
1:07:11
But I will not accept my house to be empty. I will not accept stadiums I have
1:07:16
prepared for revival to be empty. You, my servants, go out into the world.
1:07:23
Go into the highways. Go into the byways. Go any way you anywhere you can
1:07:30
find people and invite them to the wedding. Invite them to revival. Invite
1:07:36
them to 5F Church. Invite them to come receive what I have prepared for anyone
1:07:43
who would like to come and receive. [Applause]
1:07:53
And in the parable it says it says that when
1:08:07
go as many go. Oh verse 10. So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all whom they found
1:08:14
both bad and good. And the wedding hall was filled with guests. So the service
1:08:20
went to the highways and they found the bad and the good. God's calling you to find the bad and
1:08:25
the good. Fill it. [Applause] Fill it with anybody. Okay. What does
1:08:32
bad and good mean? Okay, th this means like the good would be believers who are
1:08:37
already cleaned, who already have good hearts, good motives, good intentions because God has
1:08:43
purified them, transformed them, but they just haven't encountered the power of God yet.
1:08:48
They just haven't heard the word that revival is now yet. But they're out there.
1:08:55
11 million people in Los Angeles County, 4 million people in the city of Los
1:09:02
Angeles, and there's a lot of believers there that have not heard this good news
1:09:08
in our proximity.
1:09:13
This is your city. Amen. This is it's your job to go out in the
1:09:20
highways and byways and find them and invite them and share
1:09:25
this good news with them excitedly, enthusiastically, with all your heart.
1:09:31
So, the good people represent believers who haven't heard the good news yet.
1:09:37
That God wants them to come into this revival because they're not experiencing abundant life. Some of them have demonic
1:09:42
oppression. And for all of them, he wants to anoint them to be disciples, powerful vessels of God. he can use in his power.
1:09:50
Just like we heard the testimony from the woman from Guatemala, Sarah, how her life changed when she received
1:09:56
impartation. When she started receiving these teachings, this these new wine
1:10:02
teachings. This is what God wants for all believers. He wants them in this revival.
1:10:09
Those are the good, the bad, the bad or the lost.
1:10:15
the lost. They're equally important. We need He wants them all. Get the good and the bad.
1:10:22
Those who are believers who haven't encountered his power yet, who don't know revivals now yet, and the lost.
1:10:29
Those who don't know Jesus, those who
1:10:35
just aren't following him right now. Those who were lukewarm. Those who need to be cleaned up. They are not good in
1:10:41
the heart because they're lost. We all once all were lost. We once all were bad. We are bad before Jesus makes us clean
1:10:48
and good and righteousness. Amen. So the good and the bad.
1:10:54
The believers that have been cleaned and purified and the lost, go out and invite
1:11:00
them all to the wedding. Invite them all to revival. That's what God is speaking right now.
1:11:08
Hallelujah.
1:11:18
John 4:39 it says, "Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in Jesus because of the woman's testimony."
1:11:26
The Samaritan woman at the well, she encountered God. God spoke prophetically over her. Jesus, who is God, she
1:11:32
encountered Jesus at the well, and Jesus spoke prophetically over her life.
1:11:37
spoke things about her personal life that she never told him. So that opened up her eyes, that encounter with his
1:11:44
power, the prophetic anointing, that opened up her eyes to God's love for her, to Jesus's love for her, and opened
1:11:51
up her eyes to see that he was the Messiah. And so she became saved in that moment
1:12:00
where she was at the well with Jesus and she was set on fire. She was full of
1:12:07
joy. She was full of just excitement for others to receive what she had received.
1:12:14
She was overflowing with God's love that she had to go out in the highways and
1:12:19
byways and tell everybody about Jesus.
1:12:25
So she went, the Bible says that she went and told so many people.
1:12:30
She didn't want to keep it to herself. She wanted them to receive as she had received.
1:12:36
And so then the scripture goes after she goes and tells them these people heard her testimony and
1:12:44
they were compelled to come and hear come and hear what who hear from Jesus
1:12:50
and experience Jesus because there's anointing upon her testimony.
1:12:56
And it says, "Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in Jesus
1:13:02
because of the woman's testimony. He told me everything I ever did." So
1:13:09
when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them. And he stayed two days. And because of his
1:13:15
words, many more became believers. They said to the woman, "We no longer believe just because of what you said. Now we
1:13:21
have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the savior of the world.
1:13:27
So this this verse 39 prophetically is
1:13:34
one of the most important powerful prophetic verses for all of you
1:13:42
in this time that we're living in right now for you to fulfill your purpose. Th this
1:13:48
scripture needs to come alive in your life. The scripture is for you.
1:13:54
I you have to keep the scripture in your heart for you to fulfill your purpose. It says, "Many of the Samaritans from
1:14:01
that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony."
1:14:08
Because of the woman's testimony, they believed because
1:14:15
so she went out and told people, "This is what happened when I encountered Jesus in power. This
1:14:22
is what happened." And there was the power of God moving through her testimony. And it pulled them. It pulled
1:14:31
them supernaturally. Pulled them to come and see for themselves.
1:14:37
Put curiosity in them. Put a hunger in them.
1:14:42
Pulled them to come to the wedding to receive from Jesus. And then they
1:14:48
became believers. They became a part of revival. They became disciples.
1:14:56
Your testimony is so powerful. You are so anointed. You are receiving anointing
1:15:03
all the time here. But you need to know how to be most effective with the anointing and exactly how God wants you
1:15:10
to use that anointing. Your testimony is dripping with anointing.
1:15:16
And not just your testimony, but the testimony of this revival of what Jesus
1:15:24
is doing. And how many testimonies is that? Millions. I don't know.
1:15:30
Uncountable. Yeah. The testimonies are uncountable.
1:15:41
All of those testimonies carry anointing. When you share your own testimony, it's dripping with anointing
1:15:49
that will touch people's spirits and will put hunger in them and will pull them to come and receive. When you share
1:15:57
other people's testimonies, God's doing this, I saw God do this. I saw God do that. I heard today a testimony of a
1:16:04
woman who got freed through reading a book in prison.
1:16:10
It's dripping with anointing. Hallelujah.
1:16:18
It's dripping with anointing. It's powerful. It's just as powerful as if I declare a
1:16:26
demon to go and the demon goes. Just as powerful as when I pray for someone and God moves in his power and the anointing
1:16:32
touches somebody and they fall back. Your testimony is just as powerful.
1:16:38
If you look at this story, it's Jesus plus the Samaritan woman that led to the salvation of these people that led them
1:16:45
to come and receive and be a part of revival. It was Jesus plus the Samaritan
1:16:50
woman.
1:16:55
John 4:39. You need, this is prophetic. You need to meditate on this word. You need to know that this scripture is one
1:17:01
of the most important scriptures that God is speaking prophetically to you. that you are called to be like the
1:17:07
Samaritan woman at the well. Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony.
1:17:19
Shepherds Shepherd's A shepherd's job is to feed the sheep, is to lead them into green
1:17:26
pastures, is to equip them, is to release the
1:17:31
power of God upon them. And I'm talking about like pastoral shepherds, leaders
1:17:37
of churches. A shepherd's job is to care for the sheep. A shepherd cannot birth a
1:17:45
sheep. If you think about actual shepherds and sheep, you see it's a human and then the
1:17:51
sheep. A human cannot birth a sheep, right?
1:17:58
But when sheeps get together, they birth sheeps, right?
1:18:05
But that's how it is in the spiritual realm.
1:18:11
Spiritual shepherds and spiritual sheep. I like me. I don't birth the sheep.
1:18:19
You birth the sheep. Jesus didn't birth the sheep.
1:18:26
Jesus as the shepherd in this in this story, they didn't he didn't birthe those people that came. The Samaritan
1:18:34
woman birthed them. That's why it says because of the woman's testimony, they were able to
1:18:39
come for Jesus to show up. You know, this is
1:18:46
one thing you don't see. You don't see Jesus knocking on door to door and saying, "Hello, I can do miracles for
1:18:52
you. come to my service and I'll do miracles for you. I'll heal you. I'll deliver
1:18:58
you. You don't see that, but you see people doing that. You see people going to door
1:19:04
to door. You see people spreading the word. My life has been changed. I was
1:19:09
once a lost and now I'm saved. I was once bound, but now I'm free. I was once sick, but now I'm healed.
1:19:21
Because people can see what's real. It's the proof. It's the proof. It's the
1:19:27
fruits. If I say to you, I have fruits. Everybody look at my fruits. You're not
1:19:34
going to believe I have fruits as much as if someone says, "She has fruits.
1:19:40
I've been healed. I've been delivered." When I came to 5F church for example, you know,
1:19:47
are you going to believe the person or you going to believe me more? Could believe the person testifying
1:19:53
witness. It's a testimony. It's a witness. It's evidence, not just talk.
1:20:05
And I say this so you can understand the important role you have.
1:20:11
the important role you have to expand this revival.
1:20:19
It is your job to expand revival.
1:20:26
There's a scripture that says 1 Corinthians 3:6,
1:20:31
"I planted the seed in your hearts." That's Paul. Apostle Paul says, "I planted the seed in your hearts." He's
1:20:38
saying to his spiritual children and Apollos watered it. So that was another servant of God. But it was God who made
1:20:44
it grow. So here today, that's Apostle Paul. I planted seeds in your hearts.
1:20:54
I planted I plant seeds online, putting the videos out, preaching, sharing the
1:21:00
videos of what God's doing, going to other cities, state, states,
1:21:06
and nations and ministering and planting seeds. What happens if you plant a seed, but
1:21:13
there's no water? Can it grow? No, it can die. It'll die.
1:21:20
This is how growth is for revival. This is how growth is in the kingdom. It
1:21:26
cannot be the minister doing all the work. This is the beautiful part about the
1:21:31
body of Christ that we all need each other.
1:21:36
It cannot be just the minister doing the work for revival to expand. The minister plants the seed.
1:21:44
You are like Apollos. You have to water it. You have to do your part so then God
1:21:50
can make it grow. So that God can grow the congregation. So that God can grow
1:21:56
revival. It won't grow without you.
1:22:04
And it's only grown to to the point where we are now here in LA physically and globally around the world because
1:22:11
others have watered. Others have done their part. Others have testified.
1:22:18
Others have filled their testimonies. Others have gone and spread the word through their social media and in person
1:22:23
to as many people as they could. And we've grown so big. But God wants us to grow so much more.
1:22:31
Amen. But we can't have 5% 5% of the people watering when there's
1:22:38
so many seeds. Some of those seeds will die. We need 100% to be watering so God
1:22:46
can bring the massive growth that he wants to bring that he has planned to
1:22:51
bring to fill stadiums. Hallelujah.
1:22:57
Hallelujah.
1:23:03
Matthew 7:7 it says, "Ask and it will be given to you. Seek and you will find.
1:23:09
Knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives. The one who seeks finds and to the one who
1:23:16
knocks the door will be opened." So when you ask it will be given. When
1:23:22
you seek you will find. When you knock the door will be opened. So if you don't knock the door doesn't
1:23:28
open. If you don't if you don't seek you will not find. If you do not ask then it
1:23:35
cannot be given. This is the principle in the kingdom of
1:23:40
God. You have to do something
1:23:45
to receive from the kingdom. Faith without works is dead.
1:23:52
It's time now to knock on doors
1:23:59
so that God can open them. It's time to knock on people's doors.
1:24:06
Like, listen to what God is doing.
1:24:11
Listen to what he's done in my life. Listen to what he's doing right now. Revival is now.
1:24:18
If you need healing or freedom, God can heal you and free you. If you're not experiencing abundant
1:24:25
life, you can step right into abundant life, peace, and joy right now.
1:24:31
Knock. That's how you knock.
1:24:36
Have a heart for people. God doesn't want you to be content with
1:24:43
the size we are at. 11 million people in Los Angeles County,
1:24:51
4 million people around 4 million people in the city of LA.
1:24:57
That should bother you
1:25:02
in a good way. I mean that should bother you that it should make you not
1:25:09
comfortable that you are receiving so mightily.
1:25:15
You are receiving freedom, healing, abundant life, peace, and joy, but there's all these chairs at the
1:25:21
wedding hall empty. And so many more people can be
1:25:28
receiving. And this is greater joy for you. This is
1:25:34
greater joy for us. What fun is a small wedding? It's much
1:25:39
more fun when it's bigger, right? It's much more fun. It's much more
1:25:46
exciting. It's much more beautiful. It's much more pleasing to God the bigger we
1:25:51
become. So that more and more people are encountering Jesus and are healed and are freed.
1:25:59
testimonies multiplied, miracles multiplied, salvation's multiplied. This should be in your heart.
1:26:06
We have to grow bigger. This is not good enough.
1:26:13
So that means I have to do my part. I need to be a be be on fire for this
1:26:20
revival. I need to get out of my comfort zone and go to the highways and byways and knock
1:26:26
on many many many many doors. Hallelujah.
1:26:35
Um you you you the Bible says
1:26:41
Galatians 6:9, let us not become weary in doing good. For at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give
1:26:47
up. So this is a principle in the kingdom. You have to sew to reap a harvest.
1:26:52
You have to plant the seeds. We have to water the seeds so God can make it grow. This is how it works.
1:27:01
So I remember when God spoke through my spiritual father, prophet Joe Davi, he
1:27:06
prophesied that revival is now. Before he prophesied that, that happened
1:27:12
actually at a conference in LA that I hosted that I put on. This is the first
1:27:18
conference or any kind of event that I ever put on and I was responsible for it all. And at that time I had started
1:27:25
Five-fold Church which began in the form of worship nights on a mountain. Um I
1:27:30
had started it for just a few months prior to that and that was nine months after receiving
1:27:37
the prophetic word for my life that I was called to be an apostle and I was called to reach the nations.
1:27:43
And so when I started the worship nights on the mountaintop
1:27:49
at that season of my life, I didn't have many friends. I had so many Christian friends before.
1:27:56
So many. But none of none of them pretty much almost maybe just like two of them
1:28:03
had ever encountered God's power. And so when I shared with them, they
1:28:09
didn't want to receive. Those were the first ones invited to the wedding in my life and none of them came. Pretty much
1:28:16
pretty much none of them. It also says in the Bible that a prophet
1:28:23
doesn't receive honor in his hometown. Jesus came to his hometown and he could do hardly any miracles because of lack
1:28:29
of faith. In Jesus's hometown, those would have been the first people invited to the wedding. I mean, these are the
1:28:36
people even in Jesus's heart. like I want my friends and my family, the people I grew up with to be saved.
1:28:42
They were like first invited to the wedding, but they didn't want to receive.
1:28:50
So, I had many friends. I remember like before this, like a year before, I had
1:28:55
like a um music video release party and I, you know, I had so many Christian
1:29:01
friends, probably like 30 at least, like from the church I was going to at the time. I had so many Christian friends.
1:29:08
But here when I share my testimony, when I share about this prophetic word that came through my spiritual father,
1:29:15
no one wanted to receive. No one wanted to believe. None of my friends wanted to believe. So
1:29:23
when I started that worship night on the mountaintop, it was just me and two other people the
1:29:30
first week. But I knew that God was calling me to
1:29:36
plant seeds and to knock because that's the only way that people would hear and
1:29:41
would come. So God led me to be creative. How can I
1:29:46
get the word out about these worship nights? How can I let people be
1:29:53
interested in them? Like show it in a way that it would be interesting to for they'd want to come. So God gave me the
1:30:00
idea to have to to do the worship nights. It was actually the 4th of Jul actually I think it was the 4th of July
1:30:05
I actually around that time I discovered an overlook Nancy Hoover Pole overlook
1:30:11
on Mahalland Drive that was just like an area of like this big the circumference
1:30:18
just a little overlook and I I I got the idea oh well it's a
1:30:24
beautiful view of the valley and if we have it at sunset people may like to
1:30:29
come and worship God at sunset with this beautiful knew I knew that I I should do something
1:30:35
attractive, you know, to be the light of the world, to attract people.
1:30:40
That's what God was putting on my heart to not just go through the motions, but
1:30:46
really try hard for God to get people to come and receive, make the wedding nice.
1:30:54
Amen. So, I that's how it started.
1:31:01
And I got the I I I had seen like Facebook groups before, Facebook Christian groups
1:31:08
before. So I I I I joined I don't know the number. I feel like it was probably
1:31:14
between 30 and 50, but I can't remember the number because it was years ago, but I joined so many of these Facebook
1:31:20
Christian Facebook groups and I would make the graphic myself. um
1:31:27
what did I call I don't even remember the exact name but evening like a worship night um sunset worship night
1:31:34
and post a picture of the view and I I every single week I would put it in
1:31:42
every single Facebook group on my phone
1:31:47
so that people could see and do you know what people came
1:31:54
even though Hallelujah Yeah. Even though at the time my social media
1:32:01
following was like 1,000 and it was just mostly like friends I've had in my life.
1:32:10
People came as they saw this flyer online. People came. One week two people came.
1:32:18
Another week five people came. A different week 10 people came. I think the most amount of people we had was 10
1:32:24
or so. But if I hadn't planted those seeds, if
1:32:30
I hadn't made that effort, no one would have come except for one person. I remember one
1:32:37
time he was running on the hiking trail and he heard us worshiping. But no one would have come.
1:32:45
And that's the beginnings of where we are now. Glory to God. Of revival in 161 nations. It started with planting those
1:32:52
seeds that had an immediate reaping effect and
1:32:57
others for others it was later. For others it's now this is the reaping effect because there's so much that we
1:33:04
need God to do to make it grow. He's the one that makes it grow. So our planting
1:33:10
of seeds, it's like a supernatural thing that God does on the planting of seeds. He sees our obedience and then he opens
1:33:17
up wild doors that are beyond the little seed that we planted.
1:33:23
You know, like it's supernatural what he does upon the seeds. It's not just the direct like
1:33:31
you tell somebody and then they come cuz you told them. It's that, but it's also
1:33:36
you being obedient in planting seeds. God goes above and beyond and opens up a
1:33:42
door where you only told one person or you only told one five people but yet
1:33:48
hundreds now come and receive because God moves supernaturally upon those seeds. So what happens if you tell thousands of
1:33:55
people? How much more can God move supernaturally simply by your obedience
1:34:00
he honors? Amen. Amen.
1:34:06
Like I was putting out videos week after week after week. I there was a prophetic word from my spiritual father. He said,
1:34:11
"The way that this revival is going to break out, how people will hear about this revival is through a one minute
1:34:18
video." He saw it prophetically. And so he said, "You need to be putting
1:34:23
out one minute videos regularly all the time. Keep going." Like the Israelites
1:34:28
went around the walls of Jericho and they didn't stop short like like like when when the when the
1:34:36
prophet Elijah he said strike the ground to the servant and the servant didn't only struck it a couple times I believe
1:34:43
and he says why did you stop short you would have defeated all of the armies if you would just kept going and
1:34:49
didn't stop short my spiritual father gave me that prophetic word so I knew I had to keep going I'm planting seeds I'm
1:34:55
not seeing any reaping but God's going to one They honor those seeds.
1:35:00
And so I'm putting out video after video for years. And these videos aren't increasing views. They're preaching
1:35:06
videos. They aren't even increasing in views. They they have about one to three likes usually for years.
1:35:13
Not increasing in views, not increasing in followers, not increasing in shares, nothing for years. And then one day I
1:35:22
put out a 59 second video showing different examples of God moving in power. that past year and God makes it
1:35:29
to blow up. 1 million views after only a day and a half and thousands of people testifying of
1:35:36
miracles that happened upon that video.
1:35:41
So that's what I mean about it. It's not just the direct seeds that you were planting. It's simply your obedience of
1:35:47
planting seeds. God can then move and make it grow supernaturally.
1:35:53
That's the that's a great really exciting thing about sewing for God. Hallelujah.
1:36:01
So, um I remember there's a woman who comes to
1:36:07
5F Church here. She's planted here. I'm not sure if she's here today, but she
1:36:13
one time I would go different places where believers were going to be. I would go different places where who who would be interested to come into a
1:36:19
worship night? I need to go tell them. I got like these business cards printed out from of worship nights. One time
1:36:25
actually one time I was I was um in the car wash
1:36:31
in Studio City 100 something degree weather sweating sitting there. I looked to my
1:36:38
right Tory Kelly sitting next to me and I realized that as I leave and I saw
1:36:43
that she had made songs about God before. So I I get in my car and I got
1:36:49
really out of my out of my comfort zone. I said I go back. I have to tell her about the worship nice.
1:36:55
Get out of the car. I tell her about the worship nights. I encourage her for making music about God and talking about
1:37:01
God. And I give her my business card which looked hilarious
1:37:07
and like just not not that beautiful. But I give it to her and I say you're
1:37:14
invited to the worship nights. or worship nights that just had two to five people,
1:37:21
but I would get out of my comfort zone and see everyone with compassion. They
1:37:30
need Jesus. They need his power.
1:37:35
So after having the worship nights, just a
1:37:40
couple months into having worship nights, I then was preparing this first conference for my spiritual father. And
1:37:45
this is where he prophesied that revival is now. And I didn't know he was going to prophesy it there. But I I was so
1:37:54
excited for people in LA to encounter God's power because I had never encountered God's power like I had
1:38:00
through my spiritual father, Prophet George Davyy. And my life completely changed drastically. Eyes open up to
1:38:06
God's love like never before upon encountering Jesus through him. And so
1:38:12
and I never had experienced anything close to God's power like I had
1:38:18
experienced through him. I've never experienced it in America in LA. So when he was coming to LA, I was so excited
1:38:24
for the people of LA to receive. And so I did everything possible I could. I
1:38:30
went to the print shop in North Hollywood where I was living and I found out and I was just going to print
1:38:35
flyers, but then I found out that they can do car magnets. So I printed out a
1:38:40
car magnet and I put this big car magnet of the prophetic healing conference on
1:38:45
my Jeep, white Jeep compass. And I drove it around LA for months
1:38:53
and and I went different places and put flyers. I spent hours putting flyers
1:38:59
places. I went to like Pi Hop in Pasadena and put flyers on a table. And then I heard
1:39:05
there was like a big Christian band who was going to be at the Microsoft Theater. So I I was there's going to be
1:39:13
a lot of people who who who who would want to come who need to encounter God's power
1:39:19
at there. So I'm going to go I went down went downtown and I handed out flyers to
1:39:24
so many people that were coming out of the Microsoft theater and out of my comfort zone. It was not
1:39:31
comfortable, but I just handed them for hours. And at the time, you know, I didn't have
1:39:37
hardly any social media following. So the people came to that conference and I
1:39:42
don't know the exact number but maybe 100ish I don't know some of you have seen it
1:39:48
online does that sound right maybe 80 100 120 I don't know the exact number but looking back
1:39:55
praise God I see he moved upon my seeds because that's that's no small thing to
1:40:01
have like hardly any social media following all of your Christian friends don't want to receive
1:40:07
you know and so it's only like strangers you have to get there. And there it was all it was it was 90% like people I
1:40:14
never seen before and they came and it was just me and one other person
1:40:20
helping. That was all of the advertisement. No paid ads. That was it.
1:40:27
So if one person and this is before God did made that video go viral. This is
1:40:32
before that grace of God really moving like never before to bring in people
1:40:38
through social media. This is before that. So as I look back now,
1:40:43
I see God really honored my seeds and moved upon them.
1:40:50
So if I hadn't done that, there would be like five or 10 of us there maybe.
1:40:57
And people encountered God so powerfully. It was one of the best days of my life up to then because I saw so many people be touched by God through
1:41:03
the prophetic word so powerfully. I saw so many people be healed, be delivered before my eyes. It was the most in awe I
1:41:10
have ever been in my life. I was speechless after it. I was so full of joy for the people in LA to encounter
1:41:15
Jesus' power for the first time like I'd ever seen to this level. And then there was one gentleman and he received so
1:41:23
powerfully from God. He my spiritual father prayed for him. And this one gentleman, he told me, he said, "I saw
1:41:29
flyers at Pihop for this." Remember, I had put flyers at Pi Hop.
1:41:34
And then he said, "Oh, oh, but wait, I have to tell you something different." So, I mean, first, when I was handing
1:41:39
out flyers outside the Microsoft Theater downtown, um, he actually grabbed it and that's
1:41:45
when he said to me, "I saw this at Pi Hop. God is really telling me I have to
1:41:51
go." So
1:41:57
like me showing up that second time was that was really like God spoke through that you know and then he came I saw him
1:42:04
there and he got touched so powerfully by God at that conference. Hallelujah. What if I hadn't have gone
1:42:12
out? What if I hadn't have knocked? you know,
1:42:18
and so I actually and another story I want to tell you is that
1:42:24
during the worship night time, worship uh worship sunset worship nights, that was just a period of like a few months
1:42:32
where I did where we where that's where our service was. And at that time I was
1:42:37
going to different I remember one time handing John Tall and I handed out flyers the next year I think at a farmers market for the next conference.
1:42:44
I remember that. But anyways I would go to places where a lot of people were where a lot of believers
1:42:50
that may be interested in coming to a worship night were and I would go with the intention getting out of my comfort zone and started talking to them about
1:42:58
the worship nights and inviting them. And um I learned years later and I don't
1:43:05
know if so I don't know if she's here today but she's planted here at 5F Church but she told me like years after
1:43:12
this like three No no no no no no like I'm sorry it would been like five or six
1:43:18
years after this moment there was she said one time it we didn't have Sunday
1:43:25
services so sometimes I would like go to a church and if I talk to people I would share with them about it. So she said,
1:43:30
"You came to you you were at a church and you to you invited me and my friends to a worship night and I I think she
1:43:38
never went, but like it stayed with her for some reason. Even though I just simply shared with her about the worship
1:43:45
night, it stayed with her." And that's you. Can you come and share?
1:43:53
[Applause]
1:44:02
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise. You want to tell the story now?
1:44:07
Yes. Um, so I was one of the people in a group of three or a group of It was myself and a friend and yourself. So it
1:44:14
was us three. Um, you came to visit one of a church I was attending at that time. um you were
1:44:21
speaking actually one-on-one with my friend and I came over to join my friend and when I came over um she was speaking
1:44:27
with you and she said, "Oh, this is Katherine. She has a worship night that she's leading and she's inviting us to
1:44:34
come." And I said, "Oh, wow. That would be so I would love to come sometime." Well, my friend ended up and her um her
1:44:40
friend ended up going and making it to a worship night one night and I never was able to go. I was working all the time
1:44:47
and but it always stuck with me because it's it's so wild because even before um
1:44:54
I'd gotten the we had gotten the invitation for like maybe a year or so before the Lord had put worship night in
1:45:02
my mind and in my heart and I was like I need to find a um a worship night
1:45:08
somehow. maybe I can find one online. And because I just was always hungry, even after Sunday's service, I was
1:45:14
always hungry for more. And I said, I want to just find the more. Maybe um a
1:45:20
week night I can find like a worship night somehow and I can and I can just
1:45:25
be part of a group and we can just worship the Lord together, you know. And so that was even before I had my friend
1:45:32
and I had met you and you had a worship night. So, so God was literally putting
1:45:38
in that heart, putting that in your heart because he knew I was going to come and speak about this worship night.
1:45:45
So, he knew that I was about to plant the seed. So, he was preparing the seed
1:45:50
to be on good soil. So, Jesus. Yeah. It is all God. It was
1:45:57
all God. And so every year after that, for four years, I would follow up with
1:46:02
my friend. And for whatever reason, I just never could get to the bottom of whether or not the worship night was
1:46:08
still happening. So I had told God like twice before that, Lord, I give up. What
1:46:13
am I thinking? This is so ridiculous. What are the chances it's even still happening? You know, how do I even know?
1:46:19
Every time I ask my friend, I don't I get like a vague answer. I don't get to the bottom of it if it's still even
1:46:25
happening. So be like God just kept reminding you of me sharing about this
1:46:32
worship night for four years. And I and and this is true. Yes. And um
1:46:38
when I when I met you that day, there was something different about you. There
1:46:44
was something different about you. And I could see the Lord in you. And there was so much love and peace radiating from
1:46:50
your eyes. And when you were speaking to us, you were facing like toward the sun and your eyes were just so big and so
1:46:57
bright. And it was with God's love. It was with God's love. And it was that
1:47:02
that I would always remember. It was that what I would always remember. I said, "Wow, she's so nice." There was
1:47:08
like something different and special about just the love radiating from you. And so I never forgot that. And so for
1:47:15
four years, I was like, "Wow, I need to find this worship night." I never did. So finally, the last time I think I
1:47:21
asked my friend, she said, "We'll find her. She's on my friends list, I think, on Facebook." Well, she had like 600 friends on her Facebook. So I said, "How
1:47:27
am I ever going to find?" So I started and I got like two like 300 way through and I'm like, "Cuz you don't know my name at that
1:47:33
point." Didn't know your name. So you were just trying to find the face. I was like I was just like going in
1:47:40
faith. I'm like, "Okay, let me see if I can find her by your Yeah. Let me just see if I But she had so many friends. So
1:47:45
I didn't ever got through the list." So then I said, "Well, I had already told the Lord this I I
1:47:52
give up." So the third time I said, "I give up." Kid you not, like a week later, I'm watching a program um on Sid
1:48:00
Roth show and he says, "Well, my next guest, there's revival breaking out in a park and then it's in Los Angeles." And
1:48:08
I was like, "Revival?" Like when I heard the word revival, I was like, "Oh, I got
1:48:14
to listen to this to this guest." And so I waited and I and and you he brought
1:48:20
you on and I said I saw the curly hair and the big blue eyes and I said wait a
1:48:26
minute she looks like the woman that was having the worship nights and I said
1:48:31
well let me write down her name. So I wrote down your name and I then when it the interview was over I went to my
1:48:38
friend's friend list and I found your name was on her list. I said that's her.
1:48:43
I said that's her. and and come to find out the park where
1:48:49
it was being held was like seven blocks from where I live. And I said, "Well, I'm definitely going. I'm definitely
1:48:56
going um this next Sunday." And I did. So, and and it was just all God.
1:49:02
Praise God. Yes, it was all God. Oh my goodness. I would say the biggest
1:49:09
one is the Lord just broke off the stronghold, the yoke that was around me of alcohol. It was a crutch that I had
1:49:16
leaned on for 20 years of my life. And every time I felt stressed out or
1:49:22
overwhelmed, it was like um it was a crutch for me. But it didn't start off
1:49:28
as a stronghold, like a strong addiction. But as the years went on, it just kept having more and more of a hold
1:49:35
on me to where at one point I thought, well, I need to get help. I need to get
1:49:41
help. Um, so I asked around and they're like, "Oh, it's not that easy to get help and go to rehab and do the whole
1:49:48
process of all that." So I said, "Okay, well maybe I could just do it on my own." So I always just um kind of
1:49:54
brushed it under the rug, so to speak. Um, and then in recent years, I was
1:50:00
sober twice, 10 months, one time, eight months another time. And um and then um
1:50:07
I would I finally after flourish I was able to attend flourish and after that
1:50:13
God did a great work because um it wasn't something instant where I just felt like oh this broke off of me but I
1:50:20
noticed about two months later I didn't even like it was almost as if I had never had a drink or I had never had
1:50:26
that yoke or I'd never had that stronghold. It was like that wasn't even a part of me ever in my entire life. And
1:50:34
I had um I had said I had convinced myself before that that this is just
1:50:39
something a burden I'm always going to have to bear. Even when I was sober, even when I had
1:50:45
the strength to do it on my own, to not um drink, I was like it would I would
1:50:50
just weigh on me like, "Well, how many days has it been? How many months has it been? Oh, wow." Oh, you know, and I was
1:50:55
like, even those thoughts tormented me because I was like, it still has a hold
1:51:02
on me because I'm thinking about it and I'm counting I'm counting the months and I'm counting the time and that was what
1:51:09
was crushing to me that um like I had a yoke a strong yoke around my neck and
1:51:17
after flourish like 2 3 months it just broke off completely
1:51:24
completely. Yes. And also um one thing flourish
1:51:31
conference by the way for those of you that don't know is the is our first annual conference we had last April at
1:51:37
Fivefold Church. Yes. Yes. So it was after that um that you know I got my breakthrough. So um
1:51:45
also to I had opened myself up to like jewelry of false religion like evil eye.
1:51:52
I would wear it. I thought it was trendy fashion jewelry and I thought it was um
1:51:58
harmless. So I would wear this evil eye necklace. I also would wear a hamsa bracelet and all of these things were
1:52:04
meant to like you know quote unquote bring you protection. And so I'd opened a door with that and I had even um
1:52:12
fallen into prayer pressure when I was in my early 20s with my friends who were Buddhist. I thought well they're talking
1:52:17
about peace so maybe I should get a book on Buddhism. And I found one one day I was in at the bookstore and I found one
1:52:24
that said like Buddhism and Taoism or whatnot. And I purchased it and I started um reading it. And
1:52:32
it was really wild because in that belief system, it's like you're supposed to empty out your mind. And my it had
1:52:40
gotten to a point in my life where I I didn't make the correlation, but but now I can make the correlation. But at the
1:52:47
time I had wondered like why couldn't I have any emotions? Why didn't I have any more feelings? Why did my mind literally
1:52:54
felt so empty? And I and I was so confused. I said,
1:53:00
"Why don't I feel anything? Why don't like I can't It was like I couldn't even think because it was just emptiness
1:53:06
inside of my mind. But I had opened that door of emptying myself out." And also
1:53:12
um you know the the jewelry that I said I opened the door with wearing um falling into the belief that this would
1:53:18
protect me somehow even if it was just like harmless fashion jewelry. But now
1:53:24
because I'm been so equipped and I've learned so much at 5F Church I realized those were just all open doors.
1:53:31
Yes. And he freed me. Yeah. Yeah. Oh um sorry. So when I was one night I was um
1:53:37
on a live stream and I renounced it. I renounced false religion, Buddhism,
1:53:43
Taoism, Hamsa, evil eye, and I started shaking uncontrollably. Like my my head
1:53:49
just started going like this and my hands just were flailing and I couldn't stop it. So I knew um I was receiving
1:53:55
freedom. I received freedom from it. Yes. Yes. Yes.
1:54:01
And now Oh, yes. Now I'm just Yes. Now I'm just filled with um the joy of the
1:54:07
Lord, the peace of the Lord, the love of God for other people. Yes. And um the Lord just filled me with
1:54:14
himself. The spirit filled me in place of emptiness. The spirit of God. Yeah.
1:54:20
Praise God. Look at God's love for you. Look at God's love for you that he was pursuing
1:54:27
you, preparing you to receive this invitation.
1:54:33
Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
1:54:38
Praise God. Wow. Jesus. Hallelujah.
1:54:46
Do you Do you see how God honors our seeds? Do you see how none of your seeds
1:54:52
are wasted? Wow. I'm like so in awe right now.
1:54:58
I've heard that story before, but she went more in depth this time. I'm left in awe. Like how God was saying worship night,
1:55:04
worship night, worship night. because he he knew he was going to then send me to go to places where there would be people
1:55:09
who might want to come to worship nights. I would think in my mind where could I go where could I go to talk to people and I would be organic with it. I
1:55:16
wouldn't be forceful but when like there would be an organic conversation we're having I would make that intention to
1:55:21
invite them and to speak with passion and to see them with God's eyes and to just have a heart for them. You know and
1:55:27
so God knew he would send me then one day to say worship night come and
1:55:33
remember what how I said your testimony is anointed. your testimony about what God's doing,
1:55:38
your testimony for your life, it's so anointed. Do you see this was before the way she's describing how she saw the
1:55:45
light of Jesus in me, glory to God, this was before any demon was cast out.
1:55:53
This was two, this was like one month into me preaching for the first time,
1:55:58
10 months after receiving the prophecy for my life. This is before I had seen God manifest in power through me at all.
1:56:08
At this point, I'd not even seen anybody like tear up or seem to be touched by a message or anything. Nothing had I seen
1:56:15
evidence of God's power moving through me.
1:56:20
So, I say that to say, you have the light in you, the light of
1:56:26
Jesus in you. No matter if you've seen demons be cast
1:56:32
out through you or not yet, if you are here receiving impartation of
1:56:38
anointing week after week being planted, the light of Jesus is in you
1:56:44
in that same way that she described how that was a big reason why it stuck with her for four years and she could somehow
1:56:51
remember what I looked like. That's supernatural. I've never I've never been able to remember what someone looks like
1:56:56
by a mat four years ago, one time for like one minute.
1:57:02
But she reme that's supernatural. That's the light of Jesus piercing in somebody's memory.
1:57:11
But I I want you to to see how powerful you are. And I shared those testimonies for you
1:57:18
to for you to see that you can do this, too. and that God wants to use you just
1:57:23
as powerfully, just as powerfully, even more because it's sheep that birth
1:57:29
sheep. So that was me being a shepherd at the
1:57:35
time, even trying to birth sheep, and it still worked somehow.
1:57:40
You see what I'm saying? Like the this is your calling
1:57:45
to be like the Samaritan woman at the well. Hallelujah.
1:57:52
So I want you to see with those stories that I shared that I planted seeds and
1:58:00
God moved upon the seeds sometimes directly in a small way like that
1:58:05
gentleman that came after seeing the flyers twice that I put
1:58:10
like this testimony we heard that's direct seed but also in a very supernatural increase
1:58:17
kind of way of harvest and reaping. And for many of you, it's going to look like a domino effect. You tell one
1:58:25
person about revival. You tell you tell the good news to one person. They come and receive. And now they tell one
1:58:31
person. They tell five people. They tell five people more. They tell five people
1:58:36
more. Keeps repeating like a domino effect. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
1:58:43
This is how revival grows. So, you know, if you think of me at that
1:58:50
time when there was no social media following at all, it was just this random girl with a flyer
1:58:59
that wasn't that trendy looking, I'll tell you even. It really wasn't.
1:59:05
I did not have graphic design skills, especially back then. So, just saying
1:59:11
here, come to this event. So if that led to at least a hundred people coming
1:59:19
that's with they don't even have evidence. They don't even have the evidence like
1:59:24
we have now the fruits. What about now?
1:59:32
If you could put that kind of effort each one of you we would have to get a much bigger venue
1:59:39
for church soon.
1:59:45
It's quiet. Why is it quiet? Isn't that exciting?
1:59:54
We should not be content with the size we are at now
2:00:00
because there's so many more people out there. What if she wouldn't be here
2:00:05
today if that seed wasn't planted? How many people out there
2:00:13
God is waiting for you to go and tell them the good news? God wants you to carry that in your
2:00:18
heart. Carry that in your mind. Have that sense of urgency to spread this good news. Amen.
2:00:27
Hallelujah.
2:00:32
Romans 10:4. But how can they call on him to save
2:00:37
them unless they believe in him? And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him? How can they hear
2:00:44
about him unless someone tells them? How how and how will anyone go and tell them without being sent? That is why the
2:00:50
scriptures say, "How beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news?"
2:00:57
God wants to give you beautiful feet. Beautiful feet. More beautiful than what
2:01:02
they are right now. But it's up to you.
2:01:09
It's up to you to be that messenger.
2:01:16
Hallelujah. God wants you to have this fire in your heart.
2:01:23
May some of you maybe have been here for years. You've been planted for years.
2:01:29
You got to renew your mind, the urgency to spread this good news.
2:01:34
like as if it was your first day, your first week stepping into revival. The
2:01:40
fire you had, it's a choice to have that fire again.
2:01:46
You can have that fire simply simply by making that decision to obey God
2:01:52
and get out there and go to the highways and byways.
2:01:58
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
2:02:03
Praise God. See yourself as a Samaritan woman at the
2:02:10
well. This is your job right now. This is your task God is asking of you. This
2:02:16
is your responsibility. Take it seriously. Do it with excellence. Be creative.
2:02:25
God's going to give you creative ideas of how to reach people, of how to reach more people, and of also of how to shine
2:02:31
your light in a way that attracts them. He's going to give you ideas as you will obey him in this. As you will take the
2:02:38
step to spread this good news. As you start to meditate. As you start to have compassion and think of these people out
2:02:45
there who are lost, who are not in revival. as you start to think on them, as you start to have compassion for
2:02:50
them, as you start to pray for them, as you as you as you start to to to put
2:02:56
