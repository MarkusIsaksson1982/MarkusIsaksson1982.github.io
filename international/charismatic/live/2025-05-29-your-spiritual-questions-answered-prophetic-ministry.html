report Yesterday I had a book signing at the Barnes & Noble at the Grove in Los
28:05
Angeles and many came and many were touched by God and even someone who was
28:11
just in the Barnes & Noble came because someone had invited him someone from 5F
28:18
and um just just spontaneously and he testified of how he felt the power of
28:24
God coming upon him like waves and he was so moved to serve serve and be a
28:31
part of this move of God just by just by coming to the book discussion that part
28:38
of it and we were blown away We were in awe how Jesus moved It was so incredible
28:43
to be able to talk about Jesus and the freedom that he brings in this new kind
28:50
of space in the Barnes & Noble in West Hollywood Los Angeles That was truly
28:56
amazing and something new a new door God opened and I'm so grateful I'm so

30:06
to get into the Q&A right now Some of you had submitted these questions at the subscriber Q&As's that I do on many
30:13
Fridays Um many Fridays I do a subscriber Q&A on Instagram for those who subscribe to me on Instagram and I I
30:22
answer questions live So what you do is you join the live you write your questions in the comments and I'm
30:27
reading the comments live and I immediately answer the questions live So um today what I'm
30:35
doing is going to be kind of a preview of what these subscriber Q&A are like
30:42
And so I absolutely recommend encourage you to be a subscriber and be a part of
30:48
these subscriber Q&A so you can grow more in wisdom And it's really a time of mentorship If you have spiritual
30:53
questions you get them answered and you receive wisdom and direction So um I
30:59
have gone through the questions in the past some of the questions in the past that don't get answered I look through them all and sometimes I save them to
31:07
answer them at a time like today So um I'm going to be answering some of those questions from the past Some of these
31:14
are from a Q&A um from those who have pre-ordered my book Unlock Your Deliverance I did a Q&A um and some of
31:23
these questions are are from a subscriber Q&A that we had recently So um all right I'm going to get right into
31:29
it The first question is when you accept the devil's lies in
31:37
your mind is that opening up a door to the devil can the devil tell even if he
31:46
doesn't know your thoughts so yeah I actually taught on this this
31:52
past Sunday If you didn't watch this past Sunday's message at Fifold Church definitely make sure you check it out
31:57
after this live Um it's you can find it on my YouTube under
32:02
live But there's a scripture that says in Luke 64 6:45 "A good ma man brings
32:08
out a good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart and an evil man brings evil things out of the
32:14
evil stored up in his heart For the mouth speaks what the heart is full
32:20
of So when it comes to keeping the door shut to the enemy one of the big ways
32:29
you must keep the door shut to the enemy is by guarding your heart and guarding your mind Um your words carry so much
32:38
power and what you meditate on what you're thinking about will eventually
32:43
come out of your mouth And that's what this verse says in Luke 6:45 That what is stored up in your heart will come out
32:52
of your mouth Your mouth speaks what the heart is full of So we all deal with the
32:59
spiritual warfare that comes in the mind Every single believer goes through this
33:04
This is the enemy's biggest ways that he brings attack is in the mind is thoughts
33:10
planning thoughts planning feelings that are not yours but have come from the
33:16
enemy Um we have to know how to overcome these attacks And the way to overcome
33:23
these attacks are to resist the devil as it the Bible says submit to God resist
33:28
the devil and he will flee So when a thought comes in your mind when there's a thought in your mind maybe it feels so
33:34
much like yourself your own thought but if that thought doesn't align with the word of God it doesn't align with God's
33:41
will it doesn't align with God's character you can know automatically that it has come from the enemy And it's
33:48
your choice whether you will accept that thought And accepting that thought looks
33:54
like not resisting it and meditating on that thought You have the choice to do
34:00
that or you have the choice to reject the thought You can either accept it or reject it There's only two
34:07
options Accept or reject So if you reject it it means you are recognizing
34:14
this is not truth This has not come from God This is not what I want This is not me This is the enemy And I will reject
34:22
him As the Bible says take every thought captive Make it obedient to Christ So
34:27
I'm going to take the thought captive meaning I'm not going to let it stay in my mind and I'm going to resist the
34:34
devil I'm going to say I reject that thought I I don't want that thought in
34:40
my mind I don't agree with that thought And now and then you renew your mind with the word of God So you need to
34:47
renew your mind What is God's truth i know this is not the word of God What is the word of God saying pertaining to
34:53
this what of the What does the word of God say pertaining to my identity in Christ what does the word of God say
34:58
pertaining to how God sees me what does the word of God say pertaining to my
35:05
future what does the word of God say pertaining to how I should see my
35:10
enemies how I should see other people uh what does the word of God say pertaining
35:16
to worry etc And you find that word of God you renew
35:23
your mind with it you read it you meditate on it you can speak it aloud and you can confess it This is the truth
35:30
God does not condemn me I reject that condemning condemning thought in my mind
35:37
God has mercy and compassion for me God understands me God is helping me He is
35:44
helping me live purely He is helping me resist temptations He has gone through
35:50
everything we have gone through as he became man And so he understands Uh this is the truth God
35:58
loves me God is for me He's cheering me on He's here to help me not push me down He's here to lift me up not push me down
36:06
You renew your mind with this You speak it aloud And you can start thanking God Thank you Jesus that this is who you are
36:12
Thank you Lord that even though I made this mistake you are not condemning me You
36:18
are not punishing me You are not pushing me down But you are picking me up You are cheering me on You are helping me
36:25
You are giving me the strength to repent You're giving me the strength to stay on track next time to stay in your will
36:32
Thank you Lord I couldn't do this without you Thank you Lord I need your help I need your strength Thank you for
36:38
your love that gives me strength That gives me power by seeing your love for
36:44
me by experiencing your love So you meditate on these truths You
36:50
speak these things aloud You can confess them and you can also make it part of your prayer and thanksgiving to God as I
36:56
just as I just um demonstrated You see like med meditating on the truth and
37:05
confessing the truth can look like simply praising God and thanking
37:11
him Putting your mind there putting your mind on praising God and thanking him
37:17
Not just thank you Lord Praise God Praise you Lord But like from the heart thanking him and praising him Thank you
37:23
Lord that I've messed up but you are not condemning me Thank you Lord Thank you for your amazing
37:30
love Thank you Lord that the plans you have for me are so good Thank you Lord that you your life is in my life is in
37:38
your hands and you have everything in control and you are fighting all of my
37:43
battles for me You are defeating every enemy and you are opening up doors and you have this perfect plan You have this
37:50
perfect orchestration You have this detailed
37:56
beautiful and perfect plan for my life where you're going to open up doors in your perfect timing and your will will
38:04
be done My purpose will be fulfilled because you're in control Thank you Lord that you're in control You know you can
38:12
like thank God from the heart like this when you're in the middle of those
38:19
attacks of the enemy trying to speak the opposite It's a great way to renew your
38:29
mind So the question is when you accept the devil's lies in your mind is that opening up a door to the devil so yes
38:36
that's that's opening up a door to the devil So a lot of people feel guilty when they have negative thoughts but
38:45
honestly the devil comes in everyone's mind from time to time bringing a
38:51
thought and that thought can really feel like yours because it's not like it's an audible voice that sounds like the devil
38:57
in your mind No it's it's it's it feels like really your thought but you have to
39:04
know this is the weapons of the enemy uh planning these thoughts planning
39:10
these feelings that are coming directly for him that have nothing to do with your own
39:17
personal mind and heart but it's truly just coming
39:23
intrusively this thought So many people they feel guilty when they have these
39:28
thoughts but you should never feel guilty because you didn't ask for this You didn't do this You're not
39:33
responsible for this this thought that you had This is literally an the enemy
39:39
bringing an attack This is the Bible says no weapon formed against you shall prosper So that thought is a weapon
39:45
formed against you but it doesn't have to prosper So when when you're experiencing that thought it it's
39:51
ridiculous It's silly to think that like to feel condemned that and guilty that that's your thought That's what the
39:57
enemy wants He's a liar Um you need to be think you need to
40:03
realize this is a weapon formed against me and I am not going to let it prosper I'm not going to let it prosper by
40:10
resisting it by rejecting it So to have negative thoughts to have
40:17
sinful thoughts like if they come pop up in your mind that is not that is not you
40:23
That is not you sinning That is not something to feel bad about That's not something you you need to like repent of
40:30
But what many people do when they don't have this spiritual knowledge that I've
40:36
been sharing with you right now about thoughts how they come from the en many thoughts come from the enemy What many
40:42
people do is they they think the thoughts theirs So instead of getting rid of it
40:49
they think instead of rejecting it they think "Oh they they think they think this is truth They think this is their
40:56
original thought They think that this is truth They think that they they once when you think something's your original
41:02
thought it's not your instinct to like reject it But it's the instinct to just
41:08
keep it there and to meditate on it and to not do anything about it really Um
41:14
and that's where we get into the place where you are people are being led by their emotions They are being led by
41:21
their feelings instead of led by the Holy Spirit led by the word of God Uh so there's a
41:31
difference between having thoughts and meditating So meditating is when you you
41:38
choose to think about something again and again and again You choose to
41:44
um you know a thought comes and you choose to just like go down a rabbit hole You choose to like dwell on that
41:51
thought you choose to let that thought continue you know to take you to other
41:58
places You go more in depth with that thought And when you do that that's the
42:04
action of meditating That's the action of actually accepting that thought and
42:12
not rejecting it So that's a sin And the
42:17
Bible says in the s in Psalms let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing to
42:24
you Lord So notice it doesn't say let every
42:29
thought but it says the meditations of my heart You know because you cannot control every thought because sometimes
42:36
literally the enemy will send a thought that is not your own but you can control
42:41
the meditations of your heart So um what one big open door that believers
42:51
open up to the enemy that they do not realize is their meditations and what they speak and they end up allowing the
42:58
enemy to control their lives through what they're meditating on
43:03
and what they're speaking It's come from the enemy and they're just meditating on it and they're accepting it and they're
43:09
speaking it and everything follows The actions follow Your words have so much power and the words come from the
43:17
meditations So your meditations what's stored up in your heart is so important
43:24
It's everything And you can see this sometimes like some people may try to
43:29
hide their true character but then like in maybe stressful situations in a
43:35
situation where um of pressure or something they're they're what they've
43:43
been trying to hide comes out Okay So that's a great example of
43:48
what the scriptures is saying here with Luke 6:45 what's stored up in your heart the mouth
43:54
will speak Yeah So um if you're stewing on
44:01
something in your mind negative thoughts towards somebody or something you may try to hide what you're actually stewing
44:08
on but eventually it will come out of your mouth So
44:15
um meditating on I mean meditating on
44:20
the lies of the enemy is a big open door to the enemy Um and it leads to the the the the
44:28
the greater power which is the words when because the Bible says
44:34
that life and death is in the power of the tongue um what you speak you could speak either
44:41
life or death There's so much power in your tongue So you can either bless
44:49
prophesy partner with God to bring about his will
44:55
heal deliver walk in dominion to bring God's will You can either do that or you
45:02
can do the opposite You can be a vessel of the enemy to curse to bring death to
45:11
um bring darkness with your mouth So um the things that believers
45:19
really need to really take so much attention to to be to keep doors shut to
45:24
the enemy to please God to be spiritually mature is to is to really
45:30
guard their hearts and guards their mouth But it starts with guarding your
45:38
heart
45:44
Amen All right So I'm going to go on to the next question right now How to not have an us and them
45:55
mentality how to have a heart of unity and I think this question is is
46:00
pertaining to the body of Christ Um and and and and we as a body
46:07
are called to be united We are called to be on the same team We are on the same team but we are called to live with that
46:14
heart and mind that we are all on the same team and to cheer each other on and
46:20
um to see that we need each other That's what God wants for us But it's rare to
46:26
see that today So many denominations Unfortunately there's a with with with with leaders with some
46:33
leaders in ministry there's competition there's jealousy there's selfish
46:39
ambition and um impure motives and that leads to the opposite
46:45
of unity Um it leads to division and it can unfortunately lead
46:53
to what happened with the Pharisees and Jesus with the with a an attacking
46:59
attacking your own body Attacking a body part on your own body That's what the
47:06
Pharisees did to Jesus because they were worshiping the same God
47:11
Um
47:17
so to answer this question
47:23
so this is a complex question because
47:29
um it's not straightforward What I mean by that is well I first want to say this
47:36
the first part of this answer to this question is you need to be like a child and have
47:42
humility That's the biggest thing because the opposite of being like a
47:48
child and having humility is pride
47:55
And um on top of being like a child and having humility you need to really have
48:02
a heart to please God And you need to have a heart for God's people for all
48:10
people So the opposite of these things that I'm saying the opposite of that is
48:15
pride and is selfish ambition and jealousy Because with selfish ambition
48:22
and jealousy you are thinking so much about yourself So that's the opposite of
48:28
thinking about others You're thinking what you want You're thinking how somebody has
48:34
something that you want and how dare they You want that not them They
48:40
shouldn't have that Uh and and with
48:45
jealousy come with the jealousy spirit comes the the tearing down The jealousy spirit like deceives people into
48:53
thinking that if you push somebody down that you will get to like have what they
49:01
have like standing on another person to elevate
49:06
yourself but that doesn't work It does not work that way Um pride become pride
49:12
comes before a fall The more prideful you become the
49:18
more actions of jealousy that you do the more falling comes the more God
49:28
sees he needs to humble you The Bible says when you humble
49:33
yourself then you will be lifted But the prideful will be humbled God
49:40
will humble the proud meaning he will bring you down I humble you with uh
49:47
allowing like a fall So um so that's the big thing because the
49:53
big thing that brings division is that selfish ambition and jealousy and pride
50:01
That's what brings division in the body of Christ So that's that's the the core answer
50:08
because once you have that heart of a child and you're humble um and you have
50:15
a heart to please God and you have a heart for other people you love
50:20
people then everything else will follow Um you will automatically have a heart
50:28
of unity and not division you will automatically not be judgmental of other people and think that you're so much
50:35
better or something and look down upon people That will automatically come if you can humble yourself be childlike and
50:42
really be after God's heart and love people So everything will follow from
50:49
there
50:55
Um when you think about the times of Jesus the discip his his his his
51:04
disciples they were dealing with leaders of God the
51:10
Pharisees persecuting Jesus and persecuting Jesus's followers They were
51:16
dealing with that They were dealing with these Pharisees who were full of pride
51:22
and had no interest in uniting but just wanted to tear down Jesus and Jesus's
51:30
ministry Um so in that scenario Jesus was not saying you know
51:37
he wasn't saying well we have to unite with the Pharisees so we're going to
51:43
have to compromise Let's try to incorporate what they
51:51
believe with our doctrine Let's let's mix the doctrines
51:57
together No Jesus did not do that So it's important to have that
52:04
understanding that unity doesn't mean compromise
52:10
compromising what God is calling you to do and what God has revealed to you as
52:16
truth It doesn't mean like okay we got to make this work so we got to all just
52:23
compromise and let's mix all of our doctrines together Doesn't mean that
52:30
So you see the importance of Jesus standing firm in the new wine the new
52:37
wine doctrine and how the father was leading Jesus to minister How the father led him
52:44
to preach teach and cast out demons and heal the
52:50
sick For example doing it on the Sabbath day when
52:56
that was going to ruffle feathers you know he was uncompromising He was doing what the father told him to
53:03
do And um revival had come and God
53:09
wanted everybody all of the people of God all of the Pharisees and the Pharisees ministries
53:16
to join this move of God the Jesus
53:22
way the new wine way That's what God wanted He wanted everyone to to join the
53:30
move of God just like how God wanted all of the Israelites to follow
53:39
Moses So there comes times when God brings a move God brings revival And
53:46
what God is wanting is for all of his people to come in alignment with that
53:52
move to come and receive this new wine
53:58
Um God doesn't want the move of God to be by
54:04
itself and everyone just do their own thing Everyone else keep doing what they're doing
54:10
God doesn't want the new the new move of God to compromise with the other moves
54:17
with the other uh ministries and compromise for the sake
54:23
of unity When God brings a move like when he when he brings revival he
54:29
doesn't bring it as like for no reason and like oh oh let's just bring some
54:37
more miracles here Like he he's bringing it with such purpose He
54:44
I'm this move of God that God is bringing in has that God has brought right now the revival that has
54:52
come He has brought this move of God for the whole body of Christ And when I say
54:58
this move of God when I say revival I'm talking about the anointing the power of
55:03
God the power of God that makes demons to go that heals all kinds of sickness When I'm talking about revival and this
55:10
move of God I'm talking about the new wine doctrine the new wine revelation
55:15
that Jesus shared but has been lost by and large And rather people read the
55:21
word of God with the lens of a Pharisee with the lens of the old wine
55:28
When I'm talking about revival and the move of God I'm talking about res the restoration of the things that have been
55:34
lost in the book of Acts the apostles and the prophets the five-fold
55:39
ministry and everything that the new wine is like how we should represent Jesus
55:48
rightly with love and compassion and mercy and grace and power of
55:57
God rather than judgment and pride and
56:05
um trying to to condemn people into repentance
56:12
instead of coming in the kindness of God that leads to repentance
56:18
When I'm talking about this revival and move of God I'm talking about the
56:23
beautifying the preparation of the body of
56:28
Christ that is happening now to prepare the body of Christ for the return of
56:36
Jesus So like this move of God this revival for
56:41
example this move of God is for the whole body of Christ God wants the whole body of Christ to come in alignment with
56:48
it But the thing is is like you have many different ministries different
56:54
denominations who don't agree that apostles and prophets exist today
57:00
You have others that don't agree with
57:05
um how with the importance of honoring servants of God You have other
57:12
ministries that have been praying for people a certain
57:19
way with so much human effort and
57:24
honestly old wine doctrine that isn't looking like how Peter and Paul prayed
57:30
for the oppressed and the the sick But they think that is the right
57:35
way and they just want to continue in that way And you have other ministries
57:42
who don't want to accept anointing and impartation and the humbling that God
57:50
requires to receive impartation of
57:55
anointing You have other ministries who don't want to accept women being in
58:03
leadership pastoring You have other ministries who think you
58:08
must go to a certain Bible school or be connected with certain ministries to be
58:15
valid to be respectable to be considered a true servant of God
58:24
You have other ministries who think that wise and persuasive words and
58:30
entertainment and preachings is or and or bringing
58:36
condemnation in preachings is the o the right way to preach rather than what
58:43
Paul said that he did not come with a with wise and persuasive words but with a demonstration of God's power so that
58:52
the people's faith would not rest on man's words for it man's wisdom man's
58:58
fancy delivery with entertainment but that people's faith would rest on God's
59:03
power You know so that's what you have like today for example in the body of Christ
59:09
you have all of these different opinions and all those different opin
59:14
opinions I just described they go against the word of God but they are reading the word of God
59:21
with their old wine revelation And they are not humbling themselves
59:28
to be so they aren't humbling themselves so that God can open their eyes so that they can perceive and understand the new
59:35
wine doctrine that God has released So that's that's like that's
59:43
how it is in the body of Christ today Um
59:49
so when God has revealed the truth to you when God has revealed the new wine to you when when you have experience the
59:57
fruits of Jesus like in a ministry for example like where God is moving where
1:00:02
revival is taking place you know maybe you were other places before and you weren't
1:00:09
experiencing fruits you were in bondage you you were not fed the word of God
1:00:16
with power and love And so your relationship with God looked like full
1:00:23
of condemnation and you you were not flourishing in life
1:00:30
and you you know maybe that was your life before but now you've stepped into a ministry where God's power is moving
1:00:36
where revival is taking place and you're experiencing all of these fruits now the fruits of the spirit Your
1:00:45
life is transformed you're delivered You're you're you're receiving the new
1:00:50
wine and it's clicking for you like "Oh this is Jesus This is the food like the
1:00:57
food like the word of God that I've been longing for for so long." The truth that you you know when it's truth like when
1:01:06
um Peter said to Jesus "Where could we go?" When when Jesus asks "Will you leave me too like so many disciples left
1:01:12
me?" He says "Where could we where could we go only you have brought us the words
1:01:18
that have brought us life that have given us life So when you're
1:01:24
receiving that real revelation from God
1:01:30
um that real revelation that that comes through a ministry and then through servant of God and then when you read the Bible now that revelation is a part
1:01:36
of you So you hear God in the word now You don't hear that religion religious
1:01:42
old wine doctrine but you hear God speaking But like when you're receiving that real revelation it's like what
1:01:49
Peter said It's like it's so nourishing It's like there's just a knowing in your
1:01:55
spirit that this is this is truth And it's like everything's clicking now Like
1:02:01
you're understanding God and his ways now and you're able to have relationship
1:02:06
and intimacy with God now and flourish in your life now because you're receiving that food that revelation
1:02:12
that's opened up your eyes to to to lead you into abundant life
1:02:18
So you know if you have if imagine like the disciples of Jesus they are
1:02:25
like this is the true way not the Pharisee way you know that's that's
1:02:30
going to be today too I mean you're going to you're going to see other ministries
1:02:37
and be like that's not the way like this is the way but what's important so that we can maintain that heart of unity is
1:02:44
to have a heart of compassion and love for others to receive believe what you have It's not prideful to know like you
1:02:52
found truth because you've tasted the fruits and you knew what your life was
1:02:57
before It's not prideful to know what you found and value what you found and
1:03:03
see the difference uh of where you are now versus where you have been in the
1:03:09
past It's not prideful It's just reality you know And so how do we have unity
1:03:15
though how do we have a heart of unity for like other ministries other believers that are in old wine that
1:03:23
are living like maybe how we used to live living in bondage or in
1:03:30
condemnation not experiencing the power of God how do we have unity for them so
1:03:36
it's it's really honestly like we just need to have this heart of compassion and love Like I want this for you I want
1:03:43
you to have this You're my brother and you're my sister in Christ And I desire
1:03:49
for you to receive what I have received And so I I don't just forget you I pray
1:03:55
for you I call you into the kingdom and I plant seeds Um and a big way we can
1:04:03
can have this heart for everybody in the body of Christ is to share our
1:04:10
testimonies share our testimonies with the heart of wanting others to experience what we've
1:04:16
experienced because it's really planting seeds It's really planting
1:04:22
seeds People can't deny the truth The enemy may try to The enemy may try to
1:04:28
lie to people but there will be many people who maybe are resisting of revival at first of
1:04:37
God's new wine at first but as time goes by and they keep seeing testimonies they
1:04:45
keep seeing fruits they will know this is truth and
1:04:51
this is where God is calling me and I can't resist him anymore more it will
1:04:56
happen It's already been happening in this year of acceptance
1:05:02
So yeah that that is how we can have this heart of unity um rather than us
1:05:09
versus them And for those those it's very
1:05:15
important for my prayer is that humility would
1:05:22
come upon all believers in the body of Christ For those
1:05:28
who are not living an abundant life who are not free who are not experiencing
1:05:35
God's power who are living in condemnation and not
1:05:42
having real the real relationship with God that God desires My prayer is that they would be
1:05:50
humble If that's you humble yourself because it means that there's
1:05:56
something missing And if you're seeing fruits testimonies out there that have that
1:06:03
kind of life this abundant life humble yourself and and and and
1:06:09
listen listen to to to hear how this this life can come
1:06:19
There's some new wine doctrine that's missing in so much of the body of Christ
1:06:25
that God wants his people to hear and receive instead of reject instead of
1:06:31
being skeptical towards and reject But the only way that they can
1:06:36
hear and receive is through humility
1:06:41
That's why the the Bible says unless you become like a child like a little child
1:06:47
you will never enter into the kingdom of
1:06:53
heaven
1:07:05
Amen I deal with rejection How can I cope and understand why it's
1:07:16
happening
1:07:21
so if you're finding that you are dealing with rejection there can be a
1:07:26
lot of things involved in this And so I'm going to explain this so you can know what to do First of all
1:07:36
um the devil wants to isolate people He wants people to feel lonely He wants um
1:07:43
people to not feel loved not feel like they matter not feel like they have value And so a big scheme of the enemy
1:07:51
is to make people feel rejected And the way he does this is by finding vessels
1:07:57
who have open doors and causing them to
1:08:02
reject a person causing them to um make them
1:08:08
feel that they aren't lovable and that there's something wrong with them So you
1:08:14
really have to know that scheme of the enemy Okay so you need to know that if
1:08:22
you ever feel rejected it is the enemy at work The truth is that you are loved and
1:08:30
you are accepted by the king of kings the most important person in the world
1:08:35
Imagine if the king of your country or the queen of your country or the
1:08:42
president of your country depending on where you live and what your government's like you know some of you
1:08:47
have kings and queens some of you have presidents or prime ministers Imagine
1:08:54
if the pres the leader of your nation adored you loved you cherished
1:09:02
you wanted to meet with you constantly because you were such an amazing person
1:09:08
to be around and they gave you so many gifts so many expensive gifts You were their
1:09:16
favorite person in the world How would you feel how would that make you feel it
1:09:24
would make you feel the opposite of rejected right it would make you feel so loved so valuable and so
1:09:30
accepted Well guess what there's someone greater than the
1:09:37
leader of your nation who loves you who want who who who who wants to spend
1:09:45
every moment with you who accepts you fully who is lavishing gifts on you already
1:09:52
and has so many gifts in store to pour upon your life because he loves you And that's Jesus He's the King of
1:10:00
Kings And this is really true What I'm saying no matter how you feel no matter
1:10:07
how hard that is to wrap your head around it the fact of the matter is this is truth that I'm saying This is truth
1:10:16
It's literally like as if the leader of your nation wanted to hang out with you
1:10:22
all the time and give you gifts all the time But greater even greater even than
1:10:27
that because Jesus is so much higher than the leader of your nation or the most important person in your nation or
1:10:33
world Wow That's the truth And so if you're ever feeling anything other than
1:10:40
loved and accepted know that's the lie of the devil a lie of the devil
1:10:49
And what's very important for us as believers is
1:10:55
to walk in our true identity in Christ and
1:11:00
to be doing our part to receive the inheritance of Christ of abundant life
1:11:08
That includes peace and joy A big part of how we do that a big part
1:11:14
of how like walking in our identity in Christ and having our inheritance including peace and joy A big part of
1:11:21
that is our part to play of renewing our mind with the truth Renewing your mind with the truth
1:11:28
is what keeps you knowing who you are and seeing yourself rightly and is also
1:11:33
what keeps you full of peace and joy As you walk in your identity in
1:11:39
Christ you will have godly confidence and you will shine You will shine for Jesus To shine for Jesus to shine
1:11:46
brightly for Jesus you have to have godly confidence You have to You can't be like
1:11:52
this and shine You have to put your light on the hill on the lampstand You have
1:12:00
to walk as a daughter or son of the king Just that confidence and not
1:12:06
insecurity that confidence of knowing who you are and that you're protected and loved and accepted and taken care of
1:12:14
and that God has the most amazing plans for your life So
1:12:22
um you got to know how important that is And as you do that that's what keeps
1:12:29
you from that feeling of rejection If you have been rejected by a lot of
1:12:35
people this is a this is definitely a scheme of the enemy to try to make you
1:12:40
to not shine to try to make you to not have peace and joy and to not know God's
1:12:45
love That's a scheme So renounce that Renounce rejection you know because it's
1:12:53
important you renounce it because otherwise you're accepting it You're accepting that pattern You need to
1:12:58
recognize this is an attack of the devil on your life This can even impact you in in jobs You
1:13:05
can be applying for jobs and they reject you It can be an oppression that the enemy brought You have to take action
1:13:10
and renounce it and say "No I will not accept this rejection I will not accept
1:13:16
this pattern of rejection This is the enemy's work It will not be this yoke in my life Mm- I renounce
1:13:23
rejection." You have to do that Now I lastly want to say one other
1:13:28
thing It's like like um sometimes there can be a lot of
1:13:37
rejection because the enemy finds a door The enemy finds a door to bring
1:13:45
that rejection So it's kind of like um if you find that
1:13:54
people people are angry at you and snap at you a lot but you as a person push
1:14:00
buttons and be rude to people you're asking for it You're
1:14:06
opening up a door So it's like easier for the enemy
1:14:12
to bring hurt towards you where if you weren't that way if you
1:14:19
were kind and held your tongue the enemy can't find a door can't easily
1:14:26
um influence a person to be mean towards you You see so when it comes to like
1:14:33
rejection you also need to be humble and look at yourself and see if there's any
1:14:38
thing that you're doing that could make it easier for the enemy to find people
1:14:46
to reject you So this requires humility So for
1:14:53
example like one area of an open door where
1:15:01
people may be rejecting you like because of the door you're opening It could be
1:15:06
that you are being selfish um and it makes people not want to be
1:15:12
around you or hang around you Now this is not something to be like gh I'm not
1:15:18
lovable people don't want to hang out with me You need to humble yourself and
1:15:24
see oh I'm like egging this on you know like it's not a matter of there's
1:15:31
something wrong with you and you're not lovable but it's a matter of I need to
1:15:36
be more selfless and um putting others first and loving towards people and a
1:15:43
better listener Better listener So what you sow you reap So
1:15:49
sometimes rejection can be reaping um how you're treating people So it's
1:15:54
important that you really look at yourself and see if you're doing
1:15:59
anything that's making that's that's egging people on to reject you Once again it doesn't not time for you to get
1:16:07
insecure You can change We we all need to change We all are being transformed
1:16:12
into the image of God And so look at the areas in your life that you you need to
1:16:18
cultivate the fruits of the spirit You need to deny your flesh You need to ask God for help and make the intention to
1:16:25
be more Christlike in these areas
1:16:30
Amen Hallelujah
1:16:42
How do you know who to allow close which people
1:16:49
um I remember once you mentioned to only allow and close people that are truly surrendered How can you know that
1:16:55
someone is truly surrendered you can see through like there can be like red flags Um it's not
1:17:02
that complicated Like if you see a red flag there's a saying when people show you who they are believe them It's true
1:17:08
Like um just you not not in a way of like judging a person and being judgmental
1:17:14
for a person like judgmental to a person Um because people can make mistakes We
1:17:21
shouldn't make it let it define them But just pay attention Um well I want to
1:17:27
rewind first of all because the uh I first want to start off by saying the
1:17:34
Bible says that we should be equally yolked in our relationships and Jesus did not bring many people in very close
1:17:41
He had 12 disciples who were close to him and then there was three disciples James John and Peter that he kept really
1:17:48
close that came with him in intimate moments like the garden of Gethsemane also at the mount of transfiguration And
1:17:54
it was those three but he had thousands of disciples But he wasn't like constantly bringing
1:18:01
other people close to him It was just the 12 And they were the 12 were semi-lose Not even like really close
1:18:08
like the three So that's an example for us that we shouldn't bring everyone in close It's very it's not wise to do that
1:18:14
because when people have open doors to the enemy that's a place where the enemy can use to bring attack on your life
1:18:22
unnecessary attack and or or or influence you Maybe someone from the
1:18:29
world someone being worldly can like bring that temptation to you where if
1:18:34
you just weren't hanging out with them you wouldn't have that temptation at all You you were done with those things of
1:18:42
the world You didn't struggle with that anymore So um
1:18:49
uh so it's very important who you keep in close and you really shouldn't be having too many close friends Uh we
1:18:57
don't have the capacity for that Um and so and by by close I mean just like
1:19:03
those you're bringing into like close parts of your heart and spending a lot
1:19:09
of time with Um and so uh what's wise to
1:19:14
do is to only bring those in really close to your life Um to bring those who
1:19:20
are surrendered to God because if they're not surrendered to God they'll have open doors to the
1:19:26
enemy Um now this person's wondering how to
1:19:31
know if a person is surrendered So what what you should do is just not rush
1:19:38
into making someone a best friend a close friend that you're hanging out
1:19:43
with all the time Don't rush into that Go slower Don't move in haste And
1:19:52
as you go slowly things will be revealed You will see red flags if there are any
1:19:59
And time tells That's a big wisdom that I've learned in judging people's character is
1:20:07
giving time Time tells because the truth cannot be hidden The truth eventually
1:20:14
comes out and so there's pressure that comes upon somebody or something where true colors just show If somebody is
1:20:21
trying to hide something to try to hide something about their character over time eventually it will come out So um
1:20:29
it's it's simple It's not something complex Just give it time Don't rush
1:20:35
into things Um and also I want to say that uh you know it's really important
1:20:46
to when it comes to there there's one thing that people are not really aware of but
1:20:53
um certain things that maybe you've is you struggled with in the past you've
1:21:00
had a great temptation for in the past It was a weakness Um many times it's not usually
1:21:07
it's not wise to become close with someone who has also had the same
1:21:12
weaknesses at least before time much time has passed
1:21:18
especially for like for um if you dealt with
1:21:23
um impure sexual desires and
1:21:29
actions lust towards the same sex if that's
1:21:35
something you dealt with Um it can be pretty dangerous to become close friends with someone who
1:21:43
has had that also in their past because the en it's just it's very the
1:21:49
enemy can come in a very sneaky way and lines can get blurred and you cannot be
1:21:55
meaning to have um a romantic relationship a lustful
1:22:01
relationship with someone but it can very quickly lead into that uh so that's
1:22:08
that's a word of wisdom that a lot of people I don't think are aware of but uh
1:22:13
it's just not wise to bring someone in really close until in that regard until
1:22:19
more at least more time has passed so that um you've become so much stronger
1:22:26
in the spirit and so much more transformed because if
1:22:32
you you know close door to something in your life it doesn't mean that in that
1:22:39
area you've been totally transformed immediately So then if you open a door
1:22:47
again it could be like quickly giving into a temptation when it surprises you and
1:22:54
you're like "What i never even struggled with that." But the moment you opened a
1:23:00
door it you know it's like um it like people who have battled with like
1:23:06
alcohol and drugs they you know being addicted to it in the past like alcohol
1:23:12
for example if they had an alcohol addiction they really should not touch it again
1:23:18
They shouldn't even drink casually you know Um you can have no
1:23:24
taste for it anymore But then a only a little bit of time has passed and you're
1:23:30
like "Oh I'm good." Like "I'm just going to have a little bit and you can be surprised where now
1:23:37
you're really craving it again." And what that is is that it takes time to be
1:23:43
fully transformed So these weaknesses in our past they can still be weaknesses at
1:23:50
first like at first meaning like when you surrendered your life to Jesus and you've closed the doors But you might
1:23:56
not realize it's a weakness anymore because you haven't opened up the door But if you were to open the door
1:24:02
you would see oh this is a weakness still We don't come we don't go from having weaknesses to being strong
1:24:09
spiritually overnight It takes transformation It takes time But when
1:24:14
you keep all doors shut to the enemy even though you're not insanely strong
1:24:20
mature spiritually immediately you will God will lead you in his will perfectly
1:24:25
where you're not giving into tempt temp temptation where you're not sinning where you're not sinning because you're
1:24:31
not opening up the door But what's so important to understand is like it's not you you you can't like live recklessly
1:24:38
You can't think like I'm good now I surrendered everything to Jesus and I don't have these temptations anymore
1:24:45
So I'm strong now Like guard your heart Guard your heart Guard your spiritual
1:24:52
life And know that it takes time Take it seriously Don't take it lightly It takes
1:24:59
time to be so spiritually mature in all these areas of your life
1:25:06
Amen Amen

1:35:32
powerful It's a true miracle The power of God accomplishes what it was sent out

1:37:28
to invite you all to give thanks to God to make a sacrifice of thanksgiving to him by sewing into this work of God I'm
1:37:35
the pastor at Fifold Church You can give to this work of God at Fivefold Church right now And as you give you're
1:37:42
touching God's heart You are contributing to God's work where we have
1:37:49
church services in downtown LA every single Sunday where people are touched from all over the world where people
1:37:54
travel to from all over the world every week People are planted from 158 nations And we also are hosting and have hosted
1:38:02
many Revival is now events We are hosting many revival is now events
1:38:07
coming up We are making them free so that more people can come and nothing
1:38:12
can hold them back That there wouldn't be anything hindering them from coming But we are making it free out of
1:38:20
obedience and faith Believing that God will provide Believing that you will
1:38:25
give believing that you will be moved in your heart to contribute to this work of
1:38:31
God to make this work of God to go forth and so that many people can be touched
1:38:36
Amen As you give this is how you receive too When you sew you reap and when you
1:38:42
sew in anointed ground you are reaping from anointed ground So this is a big way you receive as well This is why we
1:38:49
should all be cheerful to give We should be cheerful to give We should be cheerful givers excited to give because
1:38:55
it's touching God's heart when we give It's pleasing him And we are we are
1:39:01
being vessels of God to advance God's kingdom which leads to more souls being saved healed and delivered and equipped
1:39:08
to be powerful vessels of God Hallelujah And number three we are cheerful to give
1:39:14
because this is how we receive One of the big ways we receive is by sewing
1:39:20
financially As the word says in as the word says many times what you sow you reap As it says God gives seed to the
1:39:28
sewer And it also says if he sees he can trust you with little he'll trust you with more So he will increase seed He
1:39:34
will increase finances He will increase blessings because you stewarded well with the seed he's given you It also
1:39:41
says in Malachi "Test me in this Bring the tithe into the storehouse and see that I won't pour out." so many
1:39:46
blessings that there's not room for all the blessings that I will pour out
1:39:52
because you have contributed financially to the work of God I will then pour out so many blessings So this these are
1:40:00
three reasons why we should be excited to give and cheerful givers and generous
1:40:05
givers Amen So if you'd like to and I also want to thank you all of you who
1:40:10
have given who who give continually because God is providing through you and

1:40:34

1:40:40
keep doing God's work and doing more for the kingdom Amen I want to declare over
1:40:46
every one of you who are giving right now So if you can lift your hands I release this anointing more of

give a heads up to all of you especially new followers here Um there's many
1:50:48
people who use my name and my face a picture of me to pretend to be me online
1:50:53
making social media accounts that are fake that are scammers Um so the way to

know that it's my original social media accounts is that on every social media page besides X I have 200,000
1:51:08
