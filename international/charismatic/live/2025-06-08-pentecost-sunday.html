39:36
called Revival Army Training Playlist and the this playlist is so important
39:43
for everyone who is new to 5F Church because there is so much new wine new
39:49
wine teaching that many have never heard before there's so much old wine and
39:55
religion in the body of Christ by and large and here we have none of that we
40:01
are we we do the Jesus way we preach the Jesus way which is new
40:07
wine and it's honestly rare so that's why I say this is so important that you
40:12
get these foundational teachings you catch up and you grow spiritually and
40:17
you get free of all of that old wine religious junk that's weighing you down
40:23
um so it's on my YouTube called the Revival Army Training Playlist i also want to make an announcement that I have
40:28
a new playlist called New Believer Playlist so this is for anybody who's just become a new believer who's just
40:34
given their life to Jesus if you have any family members or friends who just gave their lives to Jesus you can share this with them on on this playlist
40:41
there's teachings such as how to have a relationship with God how to receive Jesus the full gospel how to experience
40:47
his presence and more amen praise

41:32
through um a replay in Instagram last year in February and I was depressed
41:39

41:46
drinking a lot for the depression so God touched me and that depression left and I'm like I have to tell my sisters and
41:53
because they have like mental health and addictions to drugs brothers and sisters
41:58

42:06
for this whole year and in me too and my children too and even my aunt that she's
42:12
in Mexico she's 86 years old and she doesn't speak any English but I went uh

42:30
to go and this and that and if I have a book I just hand it over even my own books like oh I'm going to keep this one

49:02
also Dossia where's Dsia oh Dsia come here
49:14
oh Deja deja I'm sorry thank you yeah um we've seen God touch you powerfully and
49:20
deliver you layer by layer here and yeah that's what I wanted to mention as well
49:26
that my situation has been very complex um but God has been touching me here and
49:35
I've been seeing things where um some stuff has gone completely where I don't
49:41
have to struggle with that um and then some stuff I'm having to reject the enemy and I'm having to figure out how
49:48
to reject him um in a way that's not compulsive because I have a history of OCD specifically with religious stuff so
49:56
that's been an area where um it's like God's telling me just keep coming to the
50:01
well and so I'm so grateful for that um as I've been touched here I have um been
50:09
delivered from something that affected my ability to come to
50:16
church read the Bible listen to um preaching um and it started way back
50:23
like when I first started going to church um I actually began to sing in church um you began to pursue the Lord
50:32
and a trigger came it was just like all of a sudden I'm listening to the words
50:38
but I couldn't receive it it was like there was this anxiety and there was this heart pain and it was so painful
50:45
that I was going to the people and they were so kind to me they were like you know um we're going to pray for you and
50:51
they would lay hands on me i was at the altar like every Sunday um and then the
50:57
pastor told me "I think you should try therapy." And so I did and it was years
51:05
and years of me going to therapy trying to break down you know everything and
51:10
and trying to figure out why am I triggered you know by God and then it would make sense like the enemy would
51:16
come with these things like "Of course you should be scared of God look what he did in the past and look look at the Old
51:22
Testament and blah blah." It was like all these reasons why I should be afraid of God so I didn't know i didn't know
51:29
Christians could have demons i didn't know um and so as I'm on this journey
51:37
trying to figure out you know I believe you're with me God but I don't know what's going on and I'm just confused
51:42
and I'm I'm I can't receive the messages i left the church me and my husband
51:47
because he started dealing with the same thing so I remember maybe it was about 2021 or
51:55
2022 I encountered you on TikTok and it was just one video where you were
52:00
casting out demons and in that moment I asked God I said "Is this you?" Like "Is
52:08
this for me can I have it?" I felt it immediately i felt it
52:14
immediately oh Jesus i felt it and
52:25
I felt it immediately and he told me what he was starting to deliver me from in my mind and it it was jealousy and so
52:34
he started dealing with me on that and then I felt like he led me to come come to 5F and it's when you were um at the
52:41
church you were before this one so I would come and then I was still triggered i still didn't understand i
52:47
wasn't going and looking at the teachings i like I just felt like I wasn't in a place where I could receive
52:53
or understand so I left again i left your church and I've been going through
52:58
just these layers and layers of torment and then my husband and I finally realized these are demons like it's not
53:06
you know what I thought it was and so I came back about a month ago and that's when you had like you prayed for me and
53:14
even I've received even without you praying for me I was delivered from the
53:20
trigger so I'm here like I was delivered from the trigger
53:26
and I'm able to listen to the the teachings um I'm able to like I feel so
53:32
much peace here like I love being here it's like my favorite day of the week like I love coming to
53:38
church oh it's just like God has done so many things like I know you've called
53:45
out so many things and I'm just waiting on him i'm I'm waiting on him and I'm
53:50
trying to figure things out cuz I still think there's a level of confusion uh of like how to walk this out cuz it's
53:57
so new and I'm really trying um so yeah there's been a lot of
54:03
attacks but I just praise God that the trigger is gone and I'm able to come
54:09
praise God hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus
54:16
god is proud of you for continuing to seek him and be planted
54:22
and I want to speak right now that every kind of confusion that came from the
54:27
trauma in the past from the OCD in the past every kind of confusion everything
54:34
that's holding you back from being totally free in your mind it must leave
54:41
you now in Jesus'
54:47
name thank you Jesus hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God thank
54:55
you Jesus i declare now that there will be peace in your mind there will be
55:01
clarity in your mind and you will reject the devil and you'll reject the devil again if he ever comes back and you will
55:08
have peace walking in your authority in Christ in Jesus' name you won't second
55:13
guessess anything you will confidently walk like a lion bold as a lion in your authority in Jesus' name and I speak
55:22
peace to be over your mind every day and nothing to take you away from God's will
55:28
again in Jesus' name i extend this this prayer to your husband in Jesus name
55:35
this anointing to him in Jesus' name amen praise God
55:41
hallelujah hallelujah ah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus praise
55:48
God so Deja and her husband they've been coming for a month um the Lord led me to
55:54
you know I know that there's so many testimonies every week there's so many miracles that God does every week and so
56:00
this is revival here and we want to give God all the glory the most glory possible to him we don't want just
56:08
people to be receiving miracles but not hear about the miracles that God did amen we we we don't want God to get the
56:14
glory only in the seeing the manifestation but in the hearing of the
56:20
testimony of what was happening in that manifestation of God's power you know
56:25
that it wasn't just falling back or screaming but it was Jesus casting out a
56:30
demon and bringing freedom amen this is so important for God to get all the glory and it's also what leads people to
56:38
Jesus because there's so many naysayers so many people whose eyes are shut so many spirits of religion out there that
56:44
can just say it's just manifestations for example this is important we speak the truth so people can know the truth
56:52
and come and receive amen so the Lord led me to put a sign out front that says
56:58
"Do you have a testimony or have you received a miracle?" Um so this is for those of you that are coming weekly
57:05
maybe you received a miracle last Sunday maybe it was during the midweek service online maybe it was a few weeks ago or
57:12
months ago but you never shared it we would love for you to share it at the front table because we want to share
57:18
these testimonies at church amen but still make sure you're recording their testimonies as well because we can't
57:23
bring everyone up here to share their testimonies there's just so much that God's doing amen so make sure you record
57:29

1:01:05
amen praise God
1:01:12
hallelujah all right we're going to get into the word of God today it is Pentecost
1:01:18
Sunday and today I'm going to talk about the Holy Spirit i'm going to share about
1:01:23
our beautiful powerful Holy Spirit hallelujah
1:01:28
so Jesus when he was with the disciples John 16:7 he says nevertheless I tell
1:01:35
you the truth it is to your advantage that I go away for if I do not go away
1:01:40
the helper will not come to you but if I depart I will send him to you so Jesus
1:01:48
actually says to the disciples to the apostles it's better that I leave you physically even though you're able to
1:01:54
see me and touch me where you're able to see me face to face physically it's better that I go away because when I go
1:02:00
away I will send the Holy Spirit which is one with me god the Father Jesus and
1:02:06
the Holy Spirit are one they are three in one so God is the father God is Jesus
1:02:14
and God is the Holy Spirit our Lord is God our Lord is Jesus our Lord is the
1:02:20
Holy Spirit hallelujah so when we say Jesus we also
1:02:25
mean the Holy Spirit when we say God we mean Jesus when we say God we mean the Holy Spirit too three in one amen and so
1:02:33
you know Jesus it really was better that he went away he could have just stayed
1:02:38
here and we could have just seen him once in a while because there's so many
1:02:44
believers in the world so what we would see him one time in a big crowd maybe and that's it maybe not even have a
1:02:50
one-on-one encounter but with the Holy Spirit we get to have a one- on-one relationship with God 24/7 even when
1:02:58
we're sleeping God is looking at us he is with us he is intimate with us every
1:03:05
single second of every day so that's why Jesus says it is better so when you give
1:03:11
your life to Jesus when you when you give your life to Jesus and he becomes your Lord and Savior when you make that
1:03:17
decision immediately when you make that decision when you speak it with your mouth the Holy Spirit enters your life
1:03:25
comes and lives inside of your temple your body he lives inside of you so if
1:03:30
you've given your life to Jesus God the Holy Spirit lives in you right now
1:03:36
he has become one with you you are one with him he's a part of you he's not just like
1:03:43
that's why he's closer than any person could ever be because no every other person is outside of you they're not in
1:03:51
you every other person even your spouse they got to sleep sometimes their eyes
1:03:56
can't always be on you like God's eyes are always upon you so that's why he says it's better
1:04:03
that that that that that I go and I send the the helper the Holy Spirit is the
1:04:08
helper the Holy Spirit is the one who helps us be more like Jesus be more
1:04:14
Christlike the Holy Spirit is the one who helps us do what God is asking us to
1:04:20
do the Holy Spirit helps us see in the spiritual realm see the enemy's schemes
1:04:28
reject the devil's lies and keep our eyes on Jesus and do
1:04:33
all that God is asking us to do he helps us that's our
1:04:39
helper he comforts us when we need comfort he empowers us to do the things
1:04:47
that God is asking us to do that's hard for us that's our weaknesses
1:04:53
amen now God is so big he is so big that we
1:04:58
can't even comprehend how big he is he created the whole universe he is so
1:05:04
massive and it's important for you to know that
1:05:10
you have not finished in receiving from the Holy Spirit he's so big that there is so much
1:05:18
more of him to receive in your
1:05:25
life there are several different indwellings of the Holy Spirit when you
1:05:32
first give your life to Jesus the Holy Spirit immediately enters you for me that was age four and I remember it it
1:05:39
was my earliest memory in the living room on the couch my mom asking me if I wanted to give my life to Jesus i said
1:05:46
yes and so I know the Holy Spirit entered me in that moment i don't remember any kind of tangible feeling or
1:05:51
touch but I know based on scripture that the Holy Spirit entered me in that moment
1:05:58
and throughout my childhood throughout my teen years I loved God i had this
1:06:03
love for God that I knew was different than many of my friends than many around me i had this just I was just drawn to
1:06:11
God and the things of God um but when I Well first so first of
1:06:17
all that was evidence that the Holy Spirit was working in my life amen but when I entered high
1:06:25
school I put one foot in the world and started to be lukewarm for the first
1:06:31
time in my life and that lukewarmness continued
1:06:36
into college years and once I moved to LA after just
1:06:42
graduating college in 2013 as soon as
1:06:48
I took this the leap of faith and drove across the country by myself where it was just God and me and only having two
1:06:55
acquaintances out in LA and no friends or family I felt this hunger for God i felt
1:07:02
the Lord pursuing me and this hunger building in me that hunger led me to seek God a lot
1:07:10
once I came to LA seek him like never before and the Bible says Jeremiah 29:13 "You will seek me
1:07:18
and find me when you seek me with all your
1:07:24
heart." So if you seek him you will you will for sure find him
1:07:30
hallelujah but if you don't seek him you won't find him when you seek him then you will find him
1:07:40
when you seek him with all your heart so when I started seeking him and seeking him I started finding more of
1:07:46
him and more of him and one day n and a half years ago I started hearing about
1:07:53
the baptism of the Holy Spirit where the Holy Spirit would come in fire like the day of Pentecost i started hearing about
1:08:00
that and I started desiring that i wanted that one day in God's perfect
1:08:07
timing the week of my birthday January it was January 7th I was so hungry for
1:08:13
the Holy Spirit the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit came upon me
1:08:18
in fire and baptized me in fire and in that moment I experienced
1:08:26
the tangible touch of God for the first time i had been a believer in my life
1:08:31
believer my whole life since age four every memory was being a believer in Jesus i had attended church one to two
1:08:38
times every single week of my life but it wasn't until I was baptized in the
1:08:44
Holy Spirit that I had my first tangible touch of God where I felt him i felt him
1:08:51
tangibly and how I felt him first was God himself coming upon my
1:09:01
tongue and I started speaking in tongues and the the joy and excitement I
1:09:08
felt was the most excitement I've ever had in my life so much that I started yelling in
1:09:19
tongues people were around i didn't care what people thought it was just me and
1:09:25
God and it was one of the best days of my life up to that point it was the best day of my life and that tangible touch
1:09:33
that encounter with the power of the Holy Spirit opened my eyes up to the
1:09:39
fact that God has always been with me and knows me so deeply that he loves me
1:09:46
so much that he's for me that his plans for me are good that happened that revelation came upon me when I had the
1:09:54
tangible touch of the Holy Spirit upon my tongue it's like my spiritual eyes
1:09:59
opened up that he is so real and everything I've learned about him and
1:10:04
believed with like head knowledge became this know deep knowing in my heart i knew that I knew that I knew cuz now I
1:10:11
had met Jesus not just heard about him and believed but I had met him and in that moment with my eyes
1:10:20
opening up to God's love that his love is so amazing and that he is so majestic
1:10:29
and all knowing and all powerful and perfect with that came the fear of God
1:10:35
that I was the opposite of those things you know that that I needed him
1:10:40
that I didn't how could I know what was best for my life i had plans at that point i had plans to be a Christian pop
1:10:47
EDM singer songwriter after first coming out to LA to pursue acting i then believed this was God's calling for my
1:10:53
life to be a singer and I I really thought that was God's call and I was really excited about it but with this
1:10:59
fear of God opened up my eyes to the fact that I don't know everything only
1:11:04
God does who am I to think I know what's best for my life so I in that moment I felt this strong
1:11:12
desire that this was the only thing that made sense in the world was to surrender my whole life to Jesus so in that moment
1:11:19
after I was baptized in the Holy Spirit immediately on my own accord without anyone asking me a altar call leading me
1:11:27
to a a sinner's prayer or something nope i just said my own wedding vows to Jesus
1:11:32
right there and I said Jesus I give you everything i give you my plans and I
1:11:37
felt this desperation to say something drastic like I love being around people so I said even if you want to just put
1:11:44
me on an island by myself or something you can do it i felt like this this so
1:11:50
compelled to say something drastic like whatever you want God I give you my whole life because you know best and I
1:11:57
know nothing and praise God nine months later he he
1:12:04
answered that um prayer of you know give me your dreams if they're not my dreams
1:12:11
you can take my dreams i I said you can take my dreams and give me your dreams if my dreams are not your dreams for my
1:12:17
life and plans and so nine months later is when my spiritual father Prophet Dr
1:12:22
dor Davyy um prophesied to me that I was called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ
1:12:28
and because I had encountered God with a baptism of the Holy Spirit and and my
1:12:34
eyes open up that he knows best I was able to then surrender and put aside my
1:12:41
dreams of music and surrender fully and obey God in this calling of being an apostle when I didn't want that because
1:12:47
public speaking was my biggest fear and weakness and I had no desire to preach or minister i just wanted to cheer on
1:12:52
people who were getting prayed for and and bring them to the church that's what I wanted but I was able to obey God and
1:13:00
and and follow this calling for my that he had for my life um because I was
1:13:05
baptized in his spirit and he became the Holy Spirit and fire became the helper that I needed um
1:13:14
to help me surrender everything because for years prior to that I was going to a
1:13:20
church in LA for years i was even serving there they'd have like five services a day sometimes I mean a Sunday
1:13:26
I would serve the entire day i really loved God and I knew it was right to
1:13:34
surrender everything to not be lukewarm but there was something holding me back
1:13:40
from surrendering i didn't know why i didn't know what I thought something was wrong with me but after receiving the
1:13:47
baptism of the Holy Spirit I realized I was simply missing the helper
1:13:54
the helper to help me surrender i was miss you know we receive the helper of the Holy Spirit when we
1:14:01
give our lives to Jesus originally but there's a second indwelling of the Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit comes in
1:14:07
fire and the help of the fire is something different it is something
1:14:12
different because the moment I was baptized in the Holy Spirit instantly I
1:14:17
had such a strong desire for the things of God and I no longer had any appetite
1:14:24
for the things of the world the things that kept me lukewarm it vanished the
1:14:29
moment that the fire came upon my life and since that day I've been surrendered and the surrendered has the surrender
1:14:36
has grown since that day it has not been difficult to live purely and holy and
1:14:42
stay in God's will it has not been this struggle with the enemy pulling me to
1:14:49
sin and into temptation it has not been a struggle because the fire of the Holy Spirit is such a great
1:14:58
help such a great help the fire of the Holy Spirit ignites the passion for
1:15:06
Jesus in you more the fire of the Holy Spirit burns
1:15:12
away the desires of the flesh that you were battling with so much
1:15:20
before the fire of the Holy Spirit makes your spirit man to rise
1:15:28
so with the fire of the Holy Spirit coming in upon your life and continuing to fan into flame what you have
1:15:38
received you constantly can be like Jesus i mean you can const you don't have to have a day where you're so full
1:15:45
of the flesh you can constantly walk by the spirit and live godly
1:15:51
when you are open to receiving the help that comes with the fire of the Holy
1:15:56
Spirit and you value the helper of the fire of the Holy Spirit so you keep
1:16:02
fanning into flame that gift that you received amen
1:16:11
as it says in 2 Timothy 1:6 Paul says "I'm writing to encourage you to fan into flame and rekindle the fire of the
1:16:18
spiritual gift God imparted to you when I laid my hands upon
1:16:24
you." So there's there's two things that are that many Christians are missing
1:16:32
that are keeping them from living a godly life
1:16:39
one they are missing the fire of the Holy Spirit to help them to set them on
1:16:45
fire two many are oppressed with demons for me I wasn't oppressed with the demon
1:16:51
it was just that I needed the helper of the fire of the Holy Spirit but for others they need the helper the fire of
1:16:57
the Holy Spirit but also there's oppression in their life that only can be destroyed by the anointing
1:17:05
isaiah 10:27 says that the yoke shall be destroyed because of the
1:17:11
anointing the anointing is the power of God it's the Holy Spirit but
1:17:16
specifically the Holy Spirit coming in power for the purposes of to heal deliver and do
1:17:22
miracles and speak prophetically it's for ministry
1:17:28
so the helper the fire of the Holy Spirit the baptism of the Holy Spirit is for your spiritual life it's for your
1:17:35
spiritual health personally
1:17:43
you as it says in 1 Corinthians 14:4 anyone who speaks in a tongue in a
1:17:48
tongue which which is which is which uh the tongues come when the fire of the
1:17:54
Holy Spirit comes so it says anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themsself but the one who prophesies edifies the
1:18:01
church so speaking in tonesues comes from the baptism of the Holy Spirit that
1:18:06
second indwelling of the Holy Spirit it's for your personal spiritual
1:18:14
life but there's a third indwelling of the Holy Spirit that God wants every believer to have as well and that's the
1:18:22
anointing but the anointing is not for yourself
1:18:28
it's for others it's for ministry and so it is when we say the
1:18:34
anointing we mean the Holy Spirit but we mean specifically the Holy Spirit moving in power to heal deliver do miracles the
1:18:41
Holy Spirit moving in power in a vessel whom he has anointed who he has trusted he has put in the vessel and as the
1:18:49
vessel walks in their authority in Christ lays hands on the sick commands demons to go commands sicknesses to go speaks prophetically that measure of the
1:18:56
Holy Spirit the anointing moves through the vessel and touches people
1:19:03
hallelujah praise God so a lot of people say everybody has the anointing but it's that they don't
1:19:09
understand the Holy Spirit the measures of the Holy Spirit that there's more
1:19:14
not everyone has all of these indwellings of the Holy Spirit because
1:19:20
in order to find God in his fullness you have to seek him with all your
1:19:29
heart when I was baptized in the Holy Spirit I came to the place where I didn't care what people thought about me
1:19:36
i wanted to speak in tongues i didn't care if I look like a fool i just wanted more of God i wanted more of God than
1:19:44
anything else and when that happened I mean when that was in my heart God saw
1:19:50
that and that's when the fire of the Holy Spirit
1:19:55
came he sees your heart he sees that you're truly seeking him and so then he
1:20:00
will reveal more of himself to you and fill you with more he will always this baptism of the
1:20:08
Holy Spirit is for every one of you the speaking of tongues is for every one of you it's a tool that edifies your spirit
1:20:14
man that God wants for everybody amen and so you shall receive
1:20:20
this today if you've never received it before it's time to receive more of the Holy Spirit today hallelujah
1:20:28
hallelujah [Applause]
1:20:37
acts 8:14 actually before I read that I want
1:20:43
to share Acts 2:14 when the day of Pentecost came they were all together in one place suddenly
1:20:49
a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house while they were sitting they
1:20:55
saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them
1:21:01
all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the spirit enabled them all
1:21:09
of them were filled with the Holy Spirit all of them began to speak in tongues all of those believers those first
1:21:16
believers that became the first church from this day so see this is for every believer
1:21:23
amen hallelujah you have to desire the gifts you have to desire the more of God in
1:21:29
order to receive them you have to believe you have to have faith acts 8:14 it says "When the
1:21:38
apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God they sent Peter and John to Samaria when they
1:21:43
arrived they prayed for the new believers there that they might receive the Holy Spirit." Because the Holy
1:21:48
Spirit had not yet come on any of them they had simply been baptized in the
1:21:55
name of the Lord Jesus then Peter and John placed their hands on them and they received the Holy
1:22:01
Spirit so what this is speaking of is the baptism of the Holy Spirit because these people they had become believers
1:22:08
they had been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus so they did have a measure of the Holy Spirit but the Holy
1:22:15
Spirit had not yet come on them upon them in fire
1:22:24
so this is where it shares how it is a second indwelling many people don't know
1:22:29
about the baptism of the Holy Spirit i didn't know about it until about 10 years ago and I was a Christian my whole
1:22:35
life and I was open i did not know that there was this precious gift of the Holy
1:22:40
Spirit that I desperately needed if I wanted to live in God's will and be surrendered
1:22:48
it's time the eyes open up because Jesus doesn't want people to be bound in a
1:22:53
life of lukewarm and we don't need to be shaming people either for living lukewarm many many people just need the
1:22:59
helper they need the fire like me [Applause]
1:23:09
amen so the baptism of the Holy Spirit comes scripturally mainly in two ways
1:23:16
either by the laying on of hands of anointed servants of God or when an anointed servant of God is preaching is
1:23:22
ministering the Holy Spirit can just start to fall when he wants and people can start to be baptized in the Holy
1:23:27
Spirit right there just like demons go in the middle of service t sometimes
1:23:33
Holy Spirit's in control and he does what he wants amen um now it it says Acts 8:17 "Then Peter
1:23:42
and John placed their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit." Acts 10:44 "Even as Peter was saying these
1:23:48
things the Holy Spirit fell upon all who were listening to the
1:23:53
message." The Jewish believers who came with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles too for they heard them
1:24:00
speaking in other tongues and praising God so here is where where it shows in the
1:24:06
Bible the how the baptism of the Holy Spirit comes now these are our examples
1:24:12
of people being baptized in the Holy Spirit the laying on of hands or during the preaching of a message
1:24:19
um but God isn't confined to a box he can move any way he wants so there are
1:24:25
some people that in their room crying out to God the Holy Spirit just comes upon them you know actually um I we have
1:24:33
a testimony Marissa shared how she was reading my book Unlock Your Deliverance and during I think chapter
1:24:40
10 you were listening to the audio book and you started speaking in tongues yeah
1:24:47
praise God for the first time hallelujah hallelujah
1:24:53
but sometimes it can come without a servant of God praying or uh preaching
1:25:00
but it's more rare when we see in in the Bible these examples like this is how
1:25:05
the Holy Spirit came or this is how miracles happened that's how we can know
1:25:10
this is God's main way of moving these are his principles of how to receive from him like how to receive miracles we
1:25:18
see every example when we read in the gospels and when we read in the book of acts whether it was Jesus ministering or
1:25:24
Jesus the Holy Spirit moving through the apostles and through the five-fold ministers every example of a miracle
1:25:31
taking place of signs wonders of healings of demons being cast out every
1:25:37
time it was when people positioned themselves where the power of God was
1:25:42
moving through an anointed vessel because this is God's main way of
1:25:48
moving putting his anointing in a vessel the vessel walking in their authority in Christ releasing the anointing and and
1:25:54
the anointing coming upon the people doesn't mean that God can't do a miracle outside of the vessel of God
1:26:01
outside of the church outside of the online ministry he does it other ways too but this is his main way and we know
1:26:08
that because in the Bible every example it gives is is through a vessel so that's how we know God's principles
1:26:15
God's main way of releasing his the baptism of the Holy Spirit healing
1:26:20
deliverance amen praise
1:26:27
God when you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit the and you have the gift of
1:26:32
tongues now when you pray you are speaking a holy language you are
1:26:39
speaking a language that God understands you're speaking directly to God devil
1:26:45
can't hear it and God wants you to have this gift so sometimes you pray in the spirit you
1:26:52
pray God's will maybe your feelings are strong they are not they are influenced
1:26:59
by the enemy this is a time God wants you to pray in the spirit because it's going to be God's will where sometimes
1:27:06
we don't know you don't may not know God's will or your feelings are so influenced by the enemy you could pray
1:27:11
something that is not God's will so it it says 1 Corinthians 14:5 I will pray
1:27:18
with the spirit by the Holy Spirit that is within me and I will pray with the mind using words I understand so that's
1:27:24
clearly speaking about I will pray in tongues what I don't understand but I will also pray with understanding with
1:27:31
words i will sing with the spirit you can sing in tongues as well and I will
1:27:37
sing with the mind also using words that I understand
1:27:45
amen so once you have received this as some of you are going to receive the gift of tongues for the first time today
1:27:51
this is a gift and a tool that God has given you to fan into flame your spirit man to help you become more spiritual
1:27:59
less carnal it's a gift he's giving you cherish this gift value this gift don't forget about
1:28:07
it and you can pray you know just as we pray with understanding with discipline
1:28:13
not just when we feel like it you should pray in the spirit with discipline too not just when you feel like it now when
1:28:21
the Holy Spirit first comes upon you in fire it's like God overtakes your tongue
1:28:26
but I know I have a question from one of you i'd heard this question and so I want to answer this now someone had said asked one time the the the fire of the
1:28:33
Holy Spirit came upon me i started speaking in tongues god overtook my tongue but now do I need to wait for him
1:28:39
to overtake my tongue or do I just have it now you have it now it's a language
1:28:44
you have so I can decide right now I'm going to speak in tonesues right [Applause] now i just start speaking and it starts
1:28:50
coming out but you make that intention it's a part of faith it's faith as well
1:28:56
everything we do for God is based on faith not just on the not on the feelings not sitting and waiting to feel
1:29:03
a certain way or for God to just do something this is a gift and tool God's given you to for you to use amen
1:29:11
hallelujah hallelujah praise
1:29:16
God acts 2:5 it says "Now there now they were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing
1:29:22
Jews from every nation under heaven." So this is right after the Holy Spirit came on the day of Pentecost okay when they
1:29:29
heard this sound the fire the wind the wind the rushing wind that came a crowd
1:29:35
came together in bewilderment because each one heard their own language being spoken utterly amazed they asked "Aren't
1:29:42
all those who are speaking Galileans then how is it that each of us hears them in our native language?"
1:29:48
Parththeians Medis Elommites residents of Mesopatomia Judea and Capidosia
1:29:54
Pontis in Asia Fig Fijia and Pamilia Egypt in the parts of Libya near Sirene
1:30:01
visitors from Rome both Jews and converts to Judaism Credence and Arabs we are we hear them declaring the
1:30:07
wonders of God in our own tongues amazed and perplexed they asked
1:30:13
one another "What does this mean so this means that these people it was a
1:30:20
sign for them it was supernatural and it woke them up god was shaking them up
1:30:26
waking them up lifting their eyes to see a wonder to lead them to
1:30:32
him so he used this unique beautiful powerful move of the Holy Spirit through
1:30:38
tongues to lead people to Jesus
1:30:44
but then it says so this was this was a this was most of the people they were amazed and perplexed what does this
1:30:52
mean some however some made fun of them and said they have
1:30:59
had too much
1:31:07
wine there's a message that God has for you today
1:31:13
and that is if you want more of him you have to be unashamed of him he wants to give you so much more
1:31:20
but you have to actually desire him you have to be okay with being
1:31:27
misunderstood mocked and falsely accused
1:31:35
that is what these things took place when the Holy Spirit came in fire and
1:31:40
made the people to speak in tongues and you know it says you can speak in tongues like this or you can be like me when I first
1:31:48
received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and and and I'm thinking
1:31:54
that it was the the the the second way is is how since it says that it they
1:32:00
were being accused of drinking too much wine on the day of Pentecost i'm sure they were laughing
1:32:06
with the joy of the Holy Spirit they could have been rolling on the ground with laughter sometimes the Holy
1:32:14
Spirit does that he He is full of joy
1:32:20
joy not happiness of this world joy and so sometimes the Holy Spirit will come
1:32:25
so powerfully with joy that you cannot contain that joy you
1:32:33
will laugh your head off you will roll on the ground and people would think some
1:32:39
people would think you had too much wine we got to be okay with the Holy
1:32:47
Spirit's manifestations if we want to receive more of him and a lot of people are missing out
1:32:53
on the more of God because they are they were afraid of being misunderstood
1:32:58
mocked and falsely accused it
1:33:04
says in Romans 1:16 "For I am not ashamed of this good news about
1:33:11
Christ." It is the good news of Jesus Christ is the power of God at
1:33:22
work the good news of Jesus Christ is not just the name of Jesus is not just
1:33:28
the speaking about Jesus but the good news of Jesus Christ is actually the
1:33:34
power of God at
1:33:41
work and that the power of God at work is what actually saves
1:33:49
everyone everyone it's what brings the actual salvation i needed the power of God at
1:33:54
work i needed the baptism of the Holy Spirit to bring me out of being lukewarm
1:34:00
and lost and into God's will and on the narrow road i needed the power of God at
1:34:08
work every believer needs the power of God at work there are many people who
1:34:14
love Jesus but don't want and are ashamed of
1:34:21
the Holy Spirit jesus and the Holy Spirit are one
1:34:28
you can't love Jesus and hate the Holy Spirit
1:34:34
if you're hating the Holy Spirit you're also hating Jesus if you're ashamed of the Holy Spirit you're also ashamed of
1:34:39
Jesus and the Holy Spirit moves his the power
1:34:46
of God at work which the scripture says is in so many different
1:34:51
ways not just the speaking in tongues not just the joy of the Lord first
1:34:57
Corinthians 12:4 there are diversities of gifts but the same
1:35:03
spirit there are differences of ministries not all ministries look the
1:35:10
same there are differences of ministries but
1:35:16
the same Lord and there are diversities of activities but it is the same God who
1:35:23
works all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to each one for the profit of all for to one one person
1:35:32
is given the word of wisdom through the spirit to another the word of knowledge through the same spirit to another faith
1:35:38
by the same spirit to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit to another
1:35:44
the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of
1:35:52
spirits to another different kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of
1:35:57
tongues but one and the same spirit works all these things distributing to
1:36:06
each one individually as he
1:36:15
wills so in order to be embracing of the Holy Spirit and being unashamed of the
1:36:21
Holy Spirit we have to accept all of the Holy Spirit all of the different ways that he moves all of the different gifts
1:36:29
all of the new ways that he is moving because God is a God who does a new
1:36:36
thing he's not confined to a box in this revival that he has brought he is moving
1:36:41
in new ways not according to the Bible not according to the book of Acts but according to today's time in the
1:36:48
Christian culture and Christian history of recent decades he's doing a new
1:36:55
thing many people have not seen the Holy Spirit move through apostles and move
1:37:01
through prophets but this is what God is doing it is the Holy Spirit who moved
1:37:08
through Jesus it's the work that it's the spirit of God that moved through Jesus
1:37:14
it was the spirit of God that moved through Samuel to to anoint David to
1:37:21
prophesy this is the anointed servant of God that God has chosen king it was the
1:37:27
spirit of God that spoke through Moses it was the spirit of God that moved and did signs and wonders to deliver God's
1:37:35
people through Moses through a prophet it was the spirit of God that
1:37:42
moved through all of these generals of faith from the Old Testament to the New Testament it was the spirit of God that
1:37:47
moved through all the apostles all of the fivefold ministers in the book of Acts it was the same spirit the same
1:37:54
spirit who is now reviving his church restoring what
1:38:01
has been lost it is the same spirit of God who is raising up apostles and
1:38:06
prophets and is moving by his spirit just as he did through apostles in the
1:38:12
book of acts he is moving through apostles today moving in signs and wonders casting out demons healing the sick releasing impartation of
1:38:19
anointing it is the same spirit of God moving in prophets today he is rais raising up prophets today to prophesy to
1:38:27
speak his word just as he did through the Old Testament prophets just as he did through the New Testament
1:38:35
prophets it is the same spirit of God that is casting demons out of people today that was casting demons out of
1:38:42
people in the book of Acts and through Jesus same spirit but people are saying
1:38:47
it's a demonic spirit and when you do that you're grieving even sometimes blaspheing the
1:38:53
Holy Spirit this is Jesus you can't pick parts of Jesus that
1:39:02
are comfortable parts of Jesus that that people tolerate better parts of Jesus that won't get you in trouble with pe
1:39:09
with Pharisees parts of Jesus that if you just talk about these parts of Jesus or
1:39:15
associate with people who only share these parts of Jesus then no Pharisees
1:39:20
will come and attack you you're being ashamed of the Holy Spirit which is being ashamed of Jesus if you're doing
1:39:27
that God is calling all of his people now to love and embrace and accept every
1:39:34
aspect of him every aspect of his
1:39:41
spirit and just as people misunderstood mocked and falsely accused the the the
1:39:48
the first believers for speaking in tongues and being full of the Holy Spirit the same thing happens today the
1:39:53
same thing will happen today when the Holy Spirit moves through you through prophecy when the Holy Spirit moves through you to cast out a demon when the
1:39:59
Holy Spirit moves through you speaking in tongues full of the joy of the Lord the same thing will happen today we have
1:40:05
to be okay with it we have to accept it we have to love Jesus more than people's opinions
1:40:11
amen
1:40:16
hallelujah there's nothing more precious than having all of the Holy Spirit that
1:40:21
he wants to be in your life all that he wants to give you all the giftings the fullness the peace the
1:40:29
joy his word revelation from him
1:40:35
anointing there's nothing more precious than the Holy Spirit than the the than all of the indwellings the fullness of
1:40:42
the Holy Spirit that he wants to give you there's nothing more precious and so
1:40:47
God is asking you to decide once and for all to choose the Holy Spirit
1:40:55
to be completely unashamed of him so he
1:41:01
can then pour more of himself upon you there's so much more there's so many
1:41:07
more gifts of the Holy Spirit he wants to give you there's there's many of you there's ministers there's leaders that
1:41:13
God wants to use in power to heal and cast out demons but you can't be ashamed of the Holy
1:41:20
Spirit you can't be afraid of what people will think when the Holy Spirit starts to use you god waits until you
1:41:28
really desire him more than desiring approval from people he
1:41:34
waits but you could have the gifts now you could be walking in the power of God now he waits
1:41:41
today on this day of Pentecost it's time to choose the Holy Spirit in his
1:41:47
fullness it's time there's more he wants to release to you
1:41:53
today all of you some of you have never experienced the joy of the Lord where
1:42:00
God overtakes you you're overflowing with just joy and laughter because you cared about what people
1:42:06
think today God wants to touch you with his joy let him allow him desire him invite him
1:42:15
there's some ministers here leaders that God wants to use you in his power to cast out demons to heal the sick
1:42:24
let him pour out this impartation upon you know what it means know that it will
1:42:29
bring persecution but you are blessed when you are persecuted it's worth it it's part of carrying our
1:42:35
cross say "Yes Jesus i'm unashshamed to stand with you i will be persecuted pour
1:42:41
