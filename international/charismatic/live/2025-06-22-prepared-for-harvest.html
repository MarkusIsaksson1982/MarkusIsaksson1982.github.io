Now London event was one of the most powerful moves of God I've ever seen
39:03
ever the way God moved in power was shocking i was taken aback as I was
39:09
ministering i was I was literally in awe while ministering by how powerfully he
39:15
moved people were so hungry they filled the place to about capacity 2500 people
39:22
about and people traveled from 41 42 plus nations
39:29
to come to this event hallelujah this is revival
39:38
yes the people were so hungry there was hung I've ministered in London and London
39:44
area like now we're away from London two times now ever since 2022 and this
39:50
hunger was next level was several levels up i was shocked at this hunger the
39:57
hunger in London and the hunger in Europe and beyond people were I met somebody that traveled from India to be
40:02
there i mean praise God for this hunger praise God hallelujah
40:08
and you know we had originally when we when we got the venue you know based on
40:14
the the the attendees of past London events and even past Europe events we
40:19
plan to have seats because it's an option to remove the seats at that venue so we plan to have seats but we had to
40:25
remove all of the seats on the bottom the the first floor and everyone had to stand in there like sardines
40:33
because the hunger was so great hallelujah hallelujah
40:39
and as I started preaching we've seen this happen many times but
40:45
this was the next level of how God moved in power from beginning to end because
40:50
as I started preaching the Bible came alive like how it talks about in the Bible there's a scripture where it says
40:56
Jesus it's in Luke I believe Luke uh Jesus is in a synagogue preaching teaching and all of a sudden as he's
41:03
teaching a demon starts manifesting out of somebody starts speaking out of somebody and Jesus stops his teaching
41:09
and casts the demon out and the person's set free and we've seen Jesus do this
41:15
many times in revival we've seen him do it here setting people free i'm seeing even one right there who set free in the
41:21
middle of the message hallelujah um but this was like constant it was like I
41:27
would preach something and then demons would start screaming and then I would command the demons to go and Jesus would
41:33
set the person free or multiple person free multiple people free and then continue preaching and then more demons
41:39
start manifesting and then I command the demons to go and Jesus set more people free and then continue preaching this
41:45
happened all throughout like I don't know five six times maybe praise God but
41:50
praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
41:56
hallelujah hallelujah but the move of the Holy Spirit was so beautiful because we we
42:03
follow the move of the Holy Spirit we don't follow our programs and so we so I allow the Holy Spirit to interrupt me as
42:10
I preach i welcome that if that's what he wants to do to free somebody and so the move of the Holy Spirit was so
42:16
precious beautiful and powerful and then when it came to the mass deliverance
42:21
time as I was commanding demons to go Jesus's power came upon people and so
42:27
many demons could be heard leaving people it the sound of freedom was the
42:33
loudest I I believe that I have ever heard i Hallelujah it says in the book
42:38
of Acts that as you know the apostles were ministering it says demons shrieked
42:44
with a loud cry other translations says they scream
42:49
as they left people demons shrieked as they left people
42:55
and so that is what took place so many shrieks at one time which is beautiful
43:03
if you don't have spiritual eyes you can say it's like horrifying or something
43:09
but if you because it's a it's literally a demon we're seeing I mean we're hearing it
43:15
demons are evil they're from the devil you know and so if you don't have spiritual eyes you can think this is
43:22
awful this is horrible this is horrifying but if you have spiritual eyes if you read that Bible and hear
43:27
about what it sounds like when demons leave people you'll recognize that this
43:32
is the sound of freedom which is the most which is the most beautiful sound in the world
43:40
as demons it's like what's happening is that before a person was experiencing
43:46
hell as a demon tormented the person inside now hell comes out of them and we
43:54
hear hell come out of them and now they are free hallelujah
44:00
hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah
44:09
jesus jesus thank you Jesus and I know God touched people all around i can't
44:14
wait to hear more testimonies because of course I was just on the stage seeing so much but people I heard testimonies
44:20
people were being touched all the way back in the balcony praise God and actually at the end
44:27
someone shared a video of some thankfully we had people serving thank you to all who were serving capturing
44:34
video of around the venue because we know God's touching people all over the place not just what the people on the
44:39
stage are filming or by the stage and so there's one video that somebody somebody who was serving captured of a young man
44:46
who was walking who could not walk before this was after the mass deliverance and healing time praise God
44:52
praise God hallelujah all right so now enough of me talking
44:57
about it let's watch a video showing some of what God did amen
45:11
do you hear this this is the sound of demons leaving in the Acts church it says demons left
45:17
the people with a loud shriek this is the sound of freedom
45:25
[Music]
45:32
every spirit of depression and addiction must leave on three in Jesus name
45:40

47:19
um yeah just um as mama mentioned earlier um I noticed when mom started
47:25
preaching demons were screaming immediately um it was the most demons
47:31
I've ever seen cast out in the beginning of service you know during the preaching time even kind of before the preaching
47:37
time um up to 10 you know at least five but just demons after demons apostle
47:43
would say a few words and you hear you know apostle preach more then you hear more people getting delivered so just
47:50
the power of God was so tangible so evident and uh it was so amazing just next level anointing we're going higher
47:56
and it was just such an honor to be there praise God amen and Steve
48:03
yeah so um like she said um the hunger was incredible uh people just came when
48:10
they started coming into the building they were just you know going up to the front and getting ready for the event it was like an hour before and they were
48:16
already chanting Jesus revival and they they were hungry for to be touched by
48:22
God it was and and it was just incredible uh I I remember seeing one lady on the balcony and she this was
48:28
during ministry time and she it she was just you know hands up just Jesus
48:34
just just wanting Jesus to touch her and and it reminded me of revival is now
48:40
Philippines um it was just incredible so many people were manifesting all over
48:46
the place um when mama was casting out a demon of one woman and she'd say you know come out of her there would be like
48:53
five six other people screaming in in in the audience and
49:02
it the yeah people were just manifesting i remember seeing one woman on the
49:07
ground and the this was toward like the mass deliverance time and and mama
49:14
prayed for her earlier in the service but then she was like somehow just got over there and she was on the ground and
49:20
this demon was like the head was just moving really slow and just had this really fixed gaze and I was just blown
49:27
away cuz I'm like wow this is this is a devil that's coming out right now and
49:32
and like I think it was like maybe a minute after that she you know the woman got up and then spit up in a bucket and
49:39
then and then I saw another woman just like right next to her and she did the same thing and it was just all around
49:46
just people getting free it was just incredible just incredible
49:57
and and and just to also talk about uh unlock your deliverance and and the
50:04
revival event kind of tying those two together i was coming back and I got off
50:10
my plane and I was waiting for a piece of luggage and so I was just waiting and I was like "Oh man got to wait here."
50:17
Okay and um and so but God times out everything like our lives are perfectly
50:25
planned out and so I you know walked was walking to customs and another gentleman
50:32
came and he was walking and he said something about Christine's shirt because it had um Matthew 10 I believe
50:38
10:33 on the back of it and he was like hey what what is Matthew 10:33 so you know he was a Christian guy and long
50:45
story short I ended up just briefly talking to him about 5F and told him briefly about my testimony and I said
50:52
"Hey I got a book for you." And um so I had the book in my bag i pulled that
50:58
thing out and I said "This is for you." And I actually had a note like a post-it note in like on the front of the book
51:04
said "This is for you." And and uh and so it was really awesome and
51:10
he actually he he uh he actually serves at a very big ministry here in Southern California so it was like and then he he
51:18
also said that his he left his bag on the plane so he had to go back and he had to wait so like we our both of us
51:26
got you know kind of stalled you know and it was all to give him this book it
51:33
was so awesome
51:38
praise God hallelujah wow thank you for sharing praise God
51:45
hallelujah well there's so much to celebrate and thank God for all that
51:52
he's doing in this revival and this week is the 8-year anniversary of 5F Church
51:58
it was um September 18th 2016 was the first time I
52:05
went and saw my spiritual father minister for the very first time first time I ever saw him in here in LA area
52:11
and he prophesied to me my calling there at that time
52:16
and I didn't and then Holy Spirit led me to start 5F church which we started with
52:22
a different name and we also started in the form of worship nights not Sunday services yet until a few months later
52:28
but he led me to start it in June June 18th and it wasn't until months or maybe
52:34
even more than a year after that that I was led to look to see the exact timing
52:40
of that was like I felt I think this was nine months possibly since receiving the
52:46
prophecy and sure enough it was nine months to the day that 5F Church began
52:52
in the form of worship nights nine months to the day of me receiving this prophecy
52:57
that I was called to be an apostle and called to reach the nations glory to God god's details and timing is so perfect
53:06
and so we started as worship nights eight years ago uh and a few months
53:11
later we started having Sunday services and God has been so faithful through
53:17
these eight years faithful beyond how I could imagine him to be faithful he has
53:23
exceeded every expectation every prayer every dream every hope he's exceeded them all
53:29
my faith in God has grown with every single year as he proves himself
53:35
faithful to me again and again as he reveals more of his goodness as I see
53:40
more of his blessings come upon my life as a reward for surrendering to him and
53:47
serving him amen he has been so faithful over this ministry over 5F Church over this
53:53
revival his move despite everything that the enemy has tried to throw at this
53:59
ministry to try to stop this work of God or at least slow it down the devil has lost every time god has fought every
54:05
battle for us and God has brought us victory after victory after victory after victory year after year month
54:13
after month week after week and he's just getting started he's just getting
54:18
started so we have a video that we're going to share uh just celebrating what

crowds of people Jesus's heart was deeply moved with compassion because they seemed weary and helpless like
1:14:38
wandering sheep without a shepherd he turned to his disciples and said "The
1:14:43
harvest is huge and ripe but there are not enough harvesters to bring it all
1:14:49
in." The bigger the revival gets the more
1:14:55
mature disciples are needed that will turn into leaders
1:15:00
that will have great works to do and in this new phase of revival that is
1:15:07
coming it's requiring more leaders it's requiring more mature disciples to
1:15:13
be ready to no longer be bystanders and sit down but to be active and do the
1:15:20
works that God needs you to do to serve in greater levels and to serve with
1:15:26
excellence and to serve in a way that represents Christ well
1:15:31
amen and so Jesus is seeing a vast crowds of people in this scripture he's moved with
1:15:39
compassion they seem weary and helpless like wandering sheep without a shepherd
1:15:44
in this year of acceptance God has been preparing hearts he's been preparing
1:15:50
hearts to receive him and so this harvest is ripe because of what God has
1:15:55
been doing up to this point because of how God is pursuing pe how he has been
1:16:00
pursuing people for years how he's been how he has been preparing their hearts because of how he has been revealing
1:16:06
himself revealing that this move is really him you know
1:16:13
time is the greatest test is the greatest tell you you can't you can't
1:16:19
argue with things pass things standing through time
1:16:26
as there's a there's a there's a scripture that speaks of a Pharisee uh they're thinking of they're thinking of
1:16:33
what to do with these with disciples of Jesus what do we do with them do we keep them in prison do we let them go what
1:16:40
should we do and this Pharisee who has some wisdom because he's dealt with situations before of people who
1:16:48
had a lot of followers and maybe they were concerned that this move that was happening would
1:16:56
make them come against government you know or make them come against their leadership they would have these kinds
1:17:01
of concerns so this Pharisee had this wisdom and he says you know there was
1:17:07
somebody that rose up before but nothing became of him and the followers
1:17:13
just scattered or one guy like passed away so the followers scattered it didn't amount to anything it wasn't
1:17:19
something that we needed to be concerned with and try to stop because it phased out on its own on its own because God
1:17:25
wasn't with that move so he says "So for these disciples of
1:17:32
Jesus it's better to leave them alone because if God is not with them then it
1:17:40
will just fizzle out it will just fade but if it is from God
1:17:48
nothing you do can stop it and you may find yourself fighting against God you
1:17:54
you could find yourself fighting against God." So this was a wisdom actually is that this is how things work this is
1:18:00
truly how things work and so you know as
1:18:05
we pass eight years now God this is a form of God proving himself and opening up spiritual eyes
1:18:13
as God has revealed the fruits year by year by year as there has been great
1:18:18
growth year by year by year in this revival and this move of God so even
1:18:23
with time passing it's a way that God is opening up eyes and preparing hearts to finally step into the revival and
1:18:30
receive him rather than just watch people have been watching and waiting
1:18:35
for time to pass and using this wisdom of the Pharisee
1:18:41
you know well let's just see it will fade away if God's not in it but if
1:18:47
God's in it it will keep growing nothing can stop it amen so this is part of the
1:18:53
acceptable year of the Lord time has really passed and God has really proven himself in his revival
1:19:00
so we are to expect a great harvest because those who have been on the fence
1:19:05
this year it's a it's going to be a time where they finally dive into the revival
1:19:10
they catch the wave of revival and they no longer stand and watch because now
1:19:15
they are convinced now they know it's really true it's really of God hallelujah
1:19:22
hallelujah so you know God sees these these many
1:19:29
people out there this big harvest out there he sees that these people are ready to dive in but he sees that there
1:19:36
are more laborers that are needed so don't look at where you know we have to
1:19:42
look spiritually we have to go with the seasons we have to go with the prophetic word the acceptable year of God so even
1:19:48
if it looks like things aren't changing that much around you no you have to go by the prophetic word not by the
1:19:55
circumstances and we have to be expectant that any day now it's going to be a suddenly moment there will be a
1:20:01
suddenly moment any day this is me speaking from the past from past experience of the church getting smaller
1:20:09
and smaller with every year from 20 people the first year in 2017 to um down
1:20:15
to two people in 2020 dwindling down with every year and then
1:20:22
one suddenly moment God breathed upon one little Tik Tok video 59 seconds and
1:20:30
a suddenly moment happened everything changed revival broke out from there god did another suddenly moment sending one
1:20:37
person to our church service of 20some people and that person got delivered that was the first demon cast out at 5F
1:20:43
Church and then it was another suddenly moment walls of Jericho coming down where we grew to 300 in just one month
1:20:51
from 20some people to 300 and it became a global revival that day that just kept
1:20:56
growing hallelujah so God is going to keep on doing
1:21:02
suddenly moments that will shock us so we have to be ready we have to be prepared we have to go by the prophetic
1:21:08
word the season of the prophetic word not by our feelings not by the
1:21:13
circumstances we see now we need to be ready for that suddenly moment and so what God is speaking today is he's
1:21:19
saying to you all you got to prepare yourselves and have a readiness for this
1:21:24
new phase of revival you got to prepare yourselves to be equipped more to be
1:21:30
discipled at a greater level so that you can be ready for this work that is ahead because many are called and few are
1:21:37
chosen and you are the chosen you who have called your who you who have stepped fully into the revival and so
1:21:43
you are disciples you are the chosen ones you are ones that will be leaders you are the ones that God will be able
1:21:48
to entrust with anointing and with great responsibilities so you h God is wanting you to take this
1:21:56
seriously to see the seriousness of your calling
1:22:02
that unless unless you see yourself rightly unless you grab this prophetic word and take it to heart God can't
1:22:09
entrust leadership to you he can't entrust more to you you know
1:22:16
I I went from being a a pastor a shepherd of two people to
1:22:23
thousands overnight i mean it was four years of being a
1:22:28
pastor of 20 people to 15 to 10 to 5 to two but then all of a sudden a suddenly
1:22:34
moment happened and it was to uncountable i don't know the number because it wasn't just the 300 in the
1:22:40
physical church but it was online but I had to be prepared in my heart i
1:22:46
had to day by day be a disciple be a be be be equipped you know be expectant be
1:22:53
be take this prophecy seriously and this calling from God seriously instead of
1:22:58
thinking "Oh I don't know if it'll really happen or at this rate it'll be many years from now probably so I can
1:23:04
just sit back and relax." I needed to have this readiness in my heart and know
1:23:09
who I really was in Christ know what really what I was called to the great
1:23:14
calling that I was called to even though my circumstances did not look anything close to that great calling that I was
1:23:20
called to i had to know where I was going and take it seriously
1:23:26
the process be obedient to go with the process and
1:23:33
allow God to transform me each day by continually surrendering continually
1:23:38
being obedient continually humbling myself so because through that is where that transformation comes to be more
1:23:44
Christlike amen so this is what God is calling you
1:23:50
to right now we are entering a new phase of revival so it's a new phase of being
1:23:55
serious disciples and being equipped for the greater works ahead amen
1:24:08
you need to see yourself as a disciple not as a churchgoer not as a member of a congregation not as just a Christian
1:24:15
alone but as a disciple and a disciple is one who learns
1:24:21
a student that's the meaning of a disciple is a student and so you need to see yourself as a
1:24:28
student that's the only way that you'll be able to learn that's the only way that you'll
1:24:35
be able to be equipped and transform now the disciples they were with Jesus
1:24:42
being trained being equipped constantly for three years they were full-time
1:24:48
students and then all of a sudden after three years their roles shifted dramatically
1:24:55
good thing they were serious about being disciples good thing they did what Jesus said when he said "If you want to be my
1:25:00
disciple you need to count the cost you can not ever be my disciple unless you
1:25:07
pick up your cross and leave everything to follow me." He says in his word good
1:25:13
thing the disciples followed that word left everything picked up their cross and became serious about being students
1:25:21
because that is how God could then entrust them three years later with the
1:25:27
anointing with leadership with with five being five-fold ministers
1:25:33
with to be representatives of him it's because they became true disciples
1:25:41
so they could be equipped for this great calling so there's things ahead that will shock
1:25:48
you that will amaze you the plans that God has for your life
1:25:54
the responsibilities he will entrust to you many of you you'll be like "What
1:26:00
god is entrusting me to this god trusts me what i'm going to do this i never could
1:26:07
imagine doing this for God what miracles are happening through me
1:26:14
god's calling me to cast demons out of people and heal the sick god's calling me to preach
1:26:21
to people this is going to happen for many of you where you'll be like "What
1:26:26
th the God needs more leaders he need just like the disciples he needed them to go out into the world and make
1:26:33
disciples of nations as this revival grows more leaders must rise up
1:26:42
so you need to see yourself as a disciple so God can actually entrust you with what he's planned to entrust you
1:26:48
with so you can actually fulfill your purpose on this earth it's serious business time amen
1:26:56
hallelujah
1:27:02
i want to teach I want to teach you now now because this a prophetic word is
1:27:08
that you you all should prepare yourselves to be discipled in a greater level for what's to come i want to teach
1:27:16
you some keys on how to be a good disciple
1:27:22
what that looks like so 1 Peter 5:6 says "Therefore humble
1:27:28
yourselves under the mighty hand of God set this is the amplified version set
1:27:33
aside self-righteous pride so that he may exalt you to a place of honor in his
1:27:40
service at the appropriate time." Other translations say humble yourself
1:27:47
so that God may lift you in the right timing in his timing at his
1:27:53
appointed time so God wants to lift you like he lifted the disciples to a place
1:27:59
of leadership to the place where they were carrying anointing to the place that they were entrusted to represent Jesus to others he wants to entrust you
1:28:06
with these greater responsibilities and it's going to be a lifting that happens in this in this place where you are
1:28:13
really fulfilling your purpose in a greater level than currently this is the
1:28:19
place where you are lifted just by you being a disciple you've begun to fulfill
1:28:24
your purpose but there's a a place where you will be doing so much for the
1:28:29
kingdom you will be so effective in the kingdom and it's like before when you're
1:28:35
planting you're planting seeds now but now the way you're planting seeds is multiplied by so much
1:28:42
when you get to this place of of when God lifts you of what doing what
1:28:48
you were called to do on this earth amen hallelujah so for one you don't need to
1:28:53
wonder what is my purpose you're already fulfilling your purpose and God's
1:28:58
already using you powerfully when you surrender everything to Jesus when you become planted at a church where God has
1:29:04
called you to be planted at and you receive this equipping just like those disciples before they were sent out to
1:29:09
be apostles and anointed to be apostles they were fulfilling their purpose by
1:29:15
following Jesus and being disciples and being equipped that was step one to fulfilling their purpose amen so that's
1:29:21
how it works you can know you're fulfilling your purpose now but there's greater works ahead there's much greater
1:29:27
works ahead where God will use you in much greater ways be so being so
1:29:33
effective to bring victory for God's kingdom and destroying the works of the devil amen hallelujah so you have to
1:29:41
humble yourself under God's mighty hand you need to humble yourself and trust
1:29:47
that God's hand will take care of everything you need to humble yourself and give God
1:29:54
control give his hand control take your hands off of the reinss
1:30:03
and let God have his way
1:30:10
john 18:36 Jesus answered "My kingdom is not an earthly kingdom if it were my
1:30:16
followers would fight to keep me from being handed over to the Jewish leaders but my kingdom is not of this world."
1:30:26
So part of humbling yourself and setting aside self-righteous pride
1:30:33
is humbling yourself to see that God's kingdom ways are different than the
1:30:40
world's ways so different
1:30:47
and in the new wine it is so different than what many have been taught in the
1:30:53
church with the old wine and not the new wine so even though you've been a Christian for a long time it doesn't
1:31:00
mean you're a professional on knowing and understanding God's ways God's
1:31:07
principles many in the body of Christ today are babies in the new wine the new wine by
1:31:14
and large has been missing if you don't know what the new wine I'll summarize it this way it's everything we see in
1:31:21
revival that has been lost because religion had taken over bringing
1:31:26
the old wine way of the Pharisees we can't mix old wine and new wine we
1:31:31
need to step fully into the Jesus way new wine way which is what we see in the book of Acts
1:31:39
which is how ministry look like in the book of Acts which requires
1:31:44
being childlike so that God can open up your spiritual eyes and you may learn the mysteries of the kingdom as Jesus
1:31:51
says I thank you Lord for hiding these things meaning the revelation of the kingdom of God the revelation of the
1:31:58
authority of Christ the mysteries of the kingdom he says I praise you for hiding these things from those who are wise and
1:32:04
proud and for revealing it only to the humble and childlike
1:32:10
hallelujah so that's the new wine he's talking about the new wine so there's a lot of Christians that are are not
1:32:17
humble and they're so they they've been a Christian for a long time but they don't know God's ways at all they don't
1:32:22
know these things that Jesus is referring to only the humble and childlike so by and large most believers
1:32:30
in the body of Christ today and only those who have really accepted God's move and revival only those
1:32:38
most most believers today are babies in the new wine
1:32:44
most believers most of you have a lot to learn about God's true kingdom ways
1:32:52
and so Jesus is saying "My kingdom is not of this world
1:32:58
for if it were my followers would be trying to fight those coming against
1:33:03
me." But they're not my kingdom is different it's not of this world and so
1:33:11
um one of the ways that you need to humble yourself and and and stop being self-righteous is in the area of
1:33:18
thinking you know what's best thinking you know God's ways thinking that
1:33:24
because you're maybe successful on this in the world maybe you have great gifts in the world i mean that you've used in
1:33:31
the world maybe you have money maybe things have really worked out for you um
1:33:38
because of this you think that you can translate it to the kingdom of God
1:33:43
because of this you think that you know how to do things in God's kingdom
1:33:49
but God's kingdom is not of this world so it doesn't matter how much success
1:33:56
you have how much money you have how great your gifting is
1:34:01
that has nothing to do with your knowledge in the spiritual realm your knowledge of God's kingdom ways
1:34:08
it has all of that has nothing to do with bringing success in God's kingdom
1:34:15
your earthly success you cannot just translate that to God's kingdom success
1:34:24
you bring your giftings and you let God breathe upon them and and anoint them
1:34:31
but the way you use your giftings to bring about earthly success is not the
1:34:36
same way you use your giftings to bring about kingdom success kingdom of God's success
1:34:57
hallelujah so by this this is what I mean um
1:35:06
do we have a slide about um world world's way and God's way can we put Oh
1:35:12
perfect so as I was meditating on this God was revealing this to me i want this is me
1:35:19
sharing with you what I mean so if you want to have success in the world like
1:35:24
these are the general principles you work hard
1:35:29
and you work hard over time you be consistent you keep on showing up
1:35:35
working hard and you have a gifting so gifting and
1:35:40
hard work with the gifting and not just one day or one week working hard and
1:35:45
using that gifting but over time as time passes you're going to be guaranteed
1:35:50
success in the world it doesn't mean that it's um something
1:35:57
that God wants for your life it doesn't mean that that's blessed just
1:36:02
because you do those things but I'm just saying like the worldly principles if you actually have a gifting and you
1:36:09
do these things hard work keep persistence of hard work you'll find
1:36:15
success some kind of success you'll find things working out you'll find um financial success you'll find you'll
1:36:23
accomplish your goals and dreams um but so so what so so this is this is
1:36:30
what I mean when if you can have these principles and you can try to apply them to God's kingdom or think you know best
1:36:37
and it can keep you from from really learning about God's ways his kingdom ways which leads to true kingdom of
1:36:44
God's success so God's way of of having kingdom of God
1:36:52
success meaning destroying the works of the devil and advancing truly advancing God's kingdom
1:36:59
this this is the recipe this is the principle hard work
1:37:06
serving God working hard working with excellence in whatever God is calling
1:37:12
you however way God is calling you to serve over time not just one day not just one
1:37:18
week but keep on showing up keep on being obedient and using the giftings God's given you
1:37:24
but allowing him to anoint your giftings by surrendering everything surrendering
1:37:30
your whole life so God can entrust you with anointing so now your gifts will have anointing so now when you use your
1:37:36
gifts in the world's way people were touched people um were were their
1:37:43
emotions perhaps were touched they might have been blessed but no transformation came but now the anointing on your
1:37:49
gifting is going to is going to bring transformation in people's lives the power of God is going to move through you and touch people bringing healing
1:37:54
freedom o eyes eyes open up to God's love and power and they'll be transformed hallelujah
1:38:02
and so even mundane tasks with the anointing breathe upon your mundane gifts your technical gifts there will be
1:38:09
anointing on that work that you do that will lead people to be encountering
1:38:15
God's power so
1:38:20
hard work so using the giftings God's giving you and some of these are actually using new giftings like for me
1:38:25
I never knew I had a preaching gift but I surrendered everything to God and
1:38:31
allowed him to unlock the gift and I and I and and as I used that gift
1:38:39
and didn't leave it dormant I allowed him to continue to breathe upon it and make it to grow and be a strength
1:38:46
amen so all of these things but this is like one of the most important parts
1:38:52
plus God's timing
1:38:59
waiting on him and allowing his hand to be in control
1:39:10
because you know in the world's way you do this plus this plus this equals this
1:39:15
but in God's way you do this plus this plus this
1:39:22
but God's timing is that you receive the blessing of it later
1:39:28
and so if you won't humble yourself you can be frustrated because in the world's way this plus this plus this adds up
1:39:36
equals this equals success but in God's way you're not seeing results
1:39:42
you're not seeing the reward you think you should be getting because it's not God's timing yet
1:39:49
this is a big way that God humbles us and refineses us is by making us wait
1:39:56
by serving him and doing sacrificing for him and doing so much for him and not seeing an immediate reward it humbles
1:40:03
you it humbles you so you can be so focused on doing everything for God and
1:40:09
not for yourself amen so you could be so focused on I'm doing this for you Jesus
1:40:15
and only you and I don't care what I get out of it rather than this double motive
1:40:21
of well I'll get success when this when I do these things
1:40:28
amen hallelujah so God is so perfect with his ways of making us wait most of the time
1:40:37
making his timing the Bible says his ways are not our ways his thoughts are not our ways they're higher his timing
1:40:43
is not ours pretty much ever it's pretty much never our timing
1:40:50
meaning when we want it to be when we think it should be when we feel like we
1:40:55
deserve it the promise the blessing it's usually later
1:41:01
but it's perfect his timing is perfect and the blessings become so much sweeter
1:41:07
because it's God's timing because we've waited for it it carries more value
1:41:12
hallelujah because we're prepared we're prepared to steward this great blessing
1:41:19
rather than the great blessing crushing us when it comes hallelujah hallelujah
1:41:27
praise God so um many times people may be have a
1:41:33
temptation to be self-righteous in the area of success in the area of
1:41:40
giftings so many times people may think they know best
1:41:46
but really you have to be a disciple and let God teach you God's ways how they are different from
1:41:53
the world's ways many times when you have a gifting and
1:41:58
you're not seeing anything happen you're not seeing a success happen with the gifting you have the gifting
1:42:05
um you're not seeing anything happen so many times there could be a temptation to try to take things in your own hands
1:42:12
and try to make things happen when actually it's just not God's timing
1:42:22
so I'm speaking of this temptation so you can be aware so you can know how be aware of that temptation of
1:42:28
self-righteousness and and and what you can how you can know to be a better disciple to humble yourself
1:42:35
to know God's ways are different and that we should not try to make things happen on our own it says Psalms 37:7
1:42:43
"Be still in the presence of the Lord and wait patiently for him to act
1:42:51
don't worry about evil people who prosper or fret about their wicked schemes
1:42:57
i'm going to continue reading this chapter 8 I mean verse 8 now in the Passion translation listen to this this
1:43:04
is this is a really powerful passage stay away from anger and revenge keep
1:43:09
envy far from you for it only leads you into lies for one day the wicked will be
1:43:15
destroyed but those who trust in the Lord will live safe and sound with blessings
1:43:21
overflowing just a little while longer and the ungodly will vanish you will
1:43:28
look for them in vain but the humble of heart will inherit every promise and
1:43:34
enjoy abundant peace let now this is powerful let the wicked
1:43:41
keep plotting against the godly let them it says
1:43:48
that means don't take it into your own hands it means don't fight for justice
1:43:53
but let God the one who cares about justice more than anybody let him bring
1:43:59
justice in his timing
1:44:05
trust him powerful
1:44:10
powerful just a little while longer and the ungodly will vanish she will look for them in vain but the humble of heart will inherit every promise and enjoy
1:44:17
abundant peace let the Let the wicked keep plotting against the godly with all their snears and arrogant jeers
1:44:26
god doesn't lose any sleep over them and he knows their day is coming
1:44:39
now as we are in the new covenant as we are in the new covenant we love our enemies we pray for our enemies and we
1:44:46
want present day Sauls to transform into Paul's so we don't want them to vanish
1:44:53
we don't want them to die nothing like that but there is a new there is a uh a
1:45:00
revelation to be had in this where it what it's saying is God will
1:45:08
God will silence the enemies god will not let their evil works
1:45:15
prevail there will come a time where they won't be allowed to do that anymore
1:45:21
there will come a time where they will reap what they've sowed we don't want that we want them to
1:45:27
instead come to Jesus and transform and all their sins be wiped away but you
1:45:32
actually have to come to Jesus to do that not fight Jesus for your sins to be wiped away
1:45:40
for the reaping to be wiped away from the evil sewing that you did you have to actually
1:45:45
come to Jesus not fight Jesus fight his works fight his servants
1:45:52
amen so we desire for enemies for our enemies
1:45:58
to not reap anything to come to Jesus to transform to be powerful vessels of
1:46:04
God like Paul but what we can be sure of that's up to them if they want to repent and turn to Jesus or not but what we can
1:46:11
be sure of is that God God won't allow them to keep doing what they're doing
1:46:17
just like he wouldn't allow Saul to keep chasing David forever there there came a
1:46:23
time when God says no more no more and he acted david waited
1:46:30
patiently for God to act and he acted with his mighty hand and he brought David to the place of being anointed
1:46:37
king which was his calling and the promise was fulfilled god allowed the brothers of Joseph to
1:46:45
throw him in a pit to die and then sell him to slavery he allowed the wicked to do their evil plots plans and schemes he
1:46:53
allowed it for a time he gave them mercy so that they could repent
1:46:59
and all the while God used what the devil meant for harm for good
1:47:05
through a refining fire preparing Joseph for his calling refining him building
1:47:12
his faith hallelujah but there came a time when these evil
1:47:19
works against Joseph couldn't go on any longer the the brothers couldn't do anything more to him the uh people in
1:47:27
Egypt couldn't keep him in prison anymore there came a time when he acted the
1:47:33
scripture here said the first verse I said verse 7 wait patiently on the Lord wait for him to act there was a time God
1:47:42
acted to bring Joseph into the place of of his position which is the highest
1:47:49
second highest in the land and he fulfilled his promise fulfilled the promise he promised him amen
1:47:57
but you know so often if we are in the place of David or we're in the place of
1:48:02
by the way David waited years for this promise joseph waited years for this promise so they were encountering a lot
1:48:08
of injustice towards them so we you know in the world's way if we
1:48:14
were in their shoes we can tend to think years this is happening this isn't right
1:48:20
i need to take getting justice into my own hands or I need to try something different because this is just not fair
1:48:27
this is just not right this is just not working i'm not getting closer to the promised land actually you are in the
1:48:32
spiritual realm you're being refined god is setting you up to be lifted like
1:48:39
he set up Joseph to be in Egypt through the the the enemy using the
1:48:44
brothers to sell him as a slave it was Egypt where he was lifted to to fulfill his promise so So what you're going
1:48:52
through now that's the catalyst for God to fulfill the promise the attacks on your life the spiritual warfare that God
1:49:00
allows it's a catalyst to bring about the promise in your life hallelujah but
1:49:06
many times there's that there can be that temptation there can be that temptation to take things in your own
1:49:12
hands and do things the world's way rather than waiting on God because it doesn't add up it doesn't make sense
1:49:18
it's not adding up in the world's way um recipe that I just shared
1:49:25
there should be this success by now and you can have a temptation to also have
1:49:30
the self-righteousness of sacrifice i've sacrificed so much for God
1:49:38
i deserve this by now there should be success by now we should be seeing these promises by now there can be that
1:49:44
temptation to have this self-righteousness of thinking you know best of thinking you've done so much for
1:49:51
God you deserve this and that then the temptation can come to take things into your own hands rather than waiting on
1:49:58
God so to be a true disciple is to humble yourself under the mighty hand of God
1:50:04
under his hand recognize that his timing is way different than yours look at all
1:50:10
the stories in the Bible don't take things into your own hands like Sarah sarah Abraham and Sarah they were
1:50:17
promised a child and Sarah was about 65 when she was given this promise and she
1:50:25
waited for about I believe it was like 10 years or so and the promise wasn't
1:50:30
fulfilled yet so she decided to take things in her own hands she told Abraham
1:50:35
"Go sleep with this woman so that you can have a son." But so she gave up on
1:50:41
God's promise because so much time had passed and it wasn't adding up she was forgetting about the mighty hand of God
1:50:48
that God would act and it it would be in a supernatural way yes she was really old and no one has ever given birth at
1:50:54
that age but that's the mighty hand of God that we're called to humble ourselves under and wait on him to act
1:51:03
and so God did end up fulfilling that promise but it was just way later than she thought it was way later than what
1:51:09
logic thought should happen she's probably thinking "10 years i've
1:51:15
already waited a long time time's up." But no it was 90 when she gave birth to
1:51:23
their son to Isaac she was 90 years old and so it
1:51:29
it it was then like 15 years later than when she took it into her own hands
1:51:40
as I meditate on God's ways as I have humbled myself to learn God's ways how
1:51:45
different they are from my ways how different they are from the world's ways it's given me such rest and peace when
1:51:51
attacks come because I've seen every single attack of
1:51:57
the devil every single persecution every way the enemy uses people to try to stop
1:52:02
the work of God to try to stop 5F Church to try to stop me all of them have failed amen
1:52:09
every single one god has brought victory every single time he simply has done what he said he
1:52:16
would do he simply has fulfilled the promises in his word wait patiently on the Lord wait for him
1:52:24
to act he will act in his perfect timing humble yourself under the mighty hand of
1:52:29
God and in his timing he will lift you
1:52:35
hallelujah hallelujah you know God's taught me I never have to
1:52:40
worry again about Pharisees about whatever video anybody wants to make i
1:52:46
don't have to worry amen because I have God acting on my behalf i I have his
1:52:52
hand upon my life and the Bible says "Don't worry about
1:52:58
the wicked schemes don't worry about the the the the what the wicked are doing."
1:53:05
Hallelujah don't worry about evil people who prosper don't worry about evil people who are allowed to keep on doing
1:53:12
the evil with no repercussions saul wasn't shot down immediately as he
1:53:18
was killing Christians joseph's brothers weren't weren't killed
1:53:25
immediately when they tried to kill their brother
1:53:30
saul wasn't killed immediately when he was trying to kill David huh
1:53:37
the ones who crucified Jesus they weren't killed down right away when they did it so it can look like the wicked
1:53:44
are prospering stop it don't fret don't think about what they're doing don't Don't envy that
1:53:52
life they will reap we don't want them to reap but that that cannot keep going
1:53:58
those wicked acts cannot keep going yes it's not comfortable to feel it at
1:54:04
the time but God will be faithful he will be faithful to bring the victory
1:54:11
and to stop those wicked plans from prevailing hallelujah
1:54:17
hallelujah
1:54:23
so you need to renew your mind it's not it's not the evil people it's not the
1:54:30
people the Pharisees who have the power to slow down the
1:54:36
promise hallelujah from being fulfilled
1:54:42
it's simply God's timing when the promise delays
1:54:48
it can feel like it's your present day brothers throwing you in a pit how can they do this
1:54:55
but they don't they actually don't have the power to slow down the promise from being fulfilled they never have the
1:55:01
power any Pharisee any exposed video does not
1:55:06
have the power to slow down the promise from being fulfilled amen when it feels
1:55:12
like the the promise is delaying it is simply God's timing it's simply God is
1:55:19
in control and it's not his timing yet for the promise to be fulfilled it's
1:55:24
nothing to do with the Pharisees with those with the enemies with those who attack the work of God they are
1:55:31
powerless hallelujah hallelujah
1:55:38
praise God praise God hallelujah
1:55:45
so it's so important that you stay pure in heart
1:55:52
and you just keep your focus on becoming a disciple who represents Jesus well
1:55:59
that that's your whole focus that you don't worry about the timing that you don't worry about what the enemies are
1:56:05
doing that you don't focus on trying to make the promise come to pass
1:56:13
that's all God's job making the promise come to pass is all God's job
1:56:22
i had no power to make that video go viral
1:56:27
that was all God's doing that video that led to revival breaking out
1:56:32
i had no control of when the anointing was going to start coming out of me and making that demon manifest in March 2021
1:56:40
and the lady was set free and then revival spread wildly from there it went viral
1:56:46
i had no control of when that anointing that was growing in me was going to be like burst in that way
1:56:54
that was all God hallelujah
1:57:01
yeah yeah and so that's where God God wants you to keep your focus there on just it's very simple just being
1:57:09
humble being childlike being pure being a good representative of Jesus
1:57:15
rather than how can we make this promise come to pass just do what he's calling you to do and
1:57:23
in his perfect timing which we can't guess very well but in his perfect timing he's going to blow your mind and
1:57:28
he's going to make the promise come to pass how he wants
1:57:34
amen hallelujah hallelujah
1:57:39
that's a big key that's a big key of how I've made it through these eight years
1:57:45
of how we have made it if I've church through these eight years how we've made
1:57:50
it being able to stay in God's will how I've made it being able to stay in God's
1:57:55
will how I've made it being able to really fulfill my purpose and carry the
1:58:02
anointing and have it increase this is one of the big keys
1:58:08
is this verse from Psalm 37 be still in the presence of the Lord and
1:58:14
wait patiently for him to act don't worry about evil people who prosper or fret about their wicked schemes
1:58:22
that's a big key of actually remaining in God's will
1:58:28
and proving yourself trustworthy so that he can pour the anointing upon your life
1:58:36
not trying to defend yourself not getting riled up about the injustice
1:58:43
not being bitter in your heart about what enemies are doing to you saying
1:58:48
about you but remaining pure and waiting patiently
1:58:53
on God staying focused on the call on what God is calling you to do that's a big key of
1:59:01
how we got here of how I got here hallelujah this is the narrow road this
1:59:07
is the kingdom way it's not the world's way this is God's way
1:59:14
and so for God to entrust you with more with the anointing you have to humble yourself from thinking you know best
1:59:22
from thinking the world's way is God's way amen
1:59:28
hallelujah hallelujah praise God
1:59:35
i'm so excited for what God has in store for this ninth year of serving him ninth

2:00:13

2:00:58
we are already living in such uncontainable joy just just being a part of this revival
2:01:04
just living in the abundant life personally that the anointing brings that being planted brings that being
2:01:12
aligned with God's principles bring but also being able to hear testimony after
2:01:17
testimony being able to witness miracle after miracle every single week we are
2:01:23

2:01:46
thank you Jesus thank you Lord anybody ready here to be
2:01:51
a true disciple to be a mature disciple to be a leader
2:01:59
amen thank you on behalf of God's kingdom for taking the narrow road for
2:02:05
picking up your cross for leaving everything so that Jesus can be glorified and so
2:02:11
souls can be saved healed and delivered thank you hallelujah
2:02:16
hallelujah thank you Jesus we are going to give to God right now
2:02:24
and it says in uh 2 Corinthians 9:6
2:02:34
remember this whoever sws sparingly will also reap sparingly and whoever sws generously
2:02:41
will also reap generously
2:02:47
god is calling every one of you every one of you part of 5F Church and every one of you who desires to be used by God
2:02:55
and be a part of this revival he is calling you to sow abundantly generously
2:03:02
so that you may reap generously for God's glory and purposes
2:03:08
as you shine more the more abundant life that he brings and that he can use you more to be a steward of more that's why
2:03:15
we want to reap not for our personal gain amen but for God's plans
2:03:22
for God's purposes but also this scripture also applies to this move of
2:03:27
God the more we sew at 5F all of us the more
2:03:33
we reap a harvest the more we reap a spiritual harvest but
2:03:39
also the more we reap a financial physical harvest in order to do the more
2:03:44
works of God the more events that require much money
2:03:51
hallelujah there was a uh 5F church member from
2:03:56
South Korea this past week who God you know convicted him in the message from
2:04:02
last week that I taught if you didn't watch it it was about sacrifice watch it the the message from last Sunday but in
2:04:10
the message I was talking about how God is calling us to really be about the father's business and to really be
2:04:16
serious about sacrificing for him so that there is enough finances for the work of God to go forth and not just
2:04:22
finances but with our service with our gifts with our time but but specifically for finances we have to all be serious
2:04:30
together about the father's business so that God can do all that he wants to do
2:04:35
because it costs so many thousands of dollars for every event that we do you see 2500 people were hungry what if we
2:04:41
couldn't afford that and that costs a lot of money i forget the exact number i
2:04:46
think what was it around was 100,000ish or something around 100 so it was around 100,000 for us to do that but we needed
2:04:54
that for 2500 people so what if we were like "Oh that's too much money
2:05:02
what if we didn't have that faith?" You know okay let's just run a place for 1,000 even in the UK we the biggest
2:05:09
event we had in the UK was like not even 1,000 people
2:05:14
but this was Holy Spiritled the size that we got
2:05:20
and it required faith but what if we didn't go by the spirit we didn't go by faith we went in poverty
2:05:26
mindset we didn't have a heart for all the people to receive and we just rented a place for a thousand or 1,500 we would
2:05:32
have had to turn away a thousand people or we would have had to close registration and that's a serious deal i mean that's
2:05:39
people not being freed and for some people they needed to be there in person for their faith to lifted to be lifted
2:05:45
it wouldn't have happened online god knew they needed to be there in person you know
2:05:51
so I I just want you to know the seriousness of the higher standard that God is taking
2:05:57
us and so this venue was perfect the size was perfect it was like the perfect
2:06:02
amount but it it cost so much you know and we made it completely free
2:06:08
and so usually we we always take offering and the offerings go towards the covering of the event but in the I
2:06:14
believe I I have hope for the future but in the past it hasn't even been half really covered covering the events so
2:06:20
that's all on Five Church that's a lot you know that's a big burden that God is
2:06:26
calling more of you to lift the burden a little bit to do your part a member from 5F Church that I was sharing about in
2:06:32
South Korea God convicted him and gave him this idea what if every single one who was planted or maybe just attends
2:06:38
and watches some of the teachings that's being blessed just even just a little bit what if everyone contributed 50
2:06:44
cents or a dollar what if everyone sacrificed one thing because remember I shared last week it's not a it's not a
2:06:50
sacrifice if you don't feel feel it if you don't feel that it's a sacrifice if it's comfortable it's not a sacrifice if
2:06:57
it's comfortable so what if what if every person at at you know planet gave
2:07:03
up a coffee for example like a Starbucks coffee or something you know like you know what I mean like that's a sacrifice
2:07:09
for some people but collectively imagine what that would do because we have so
2:07:14
many people planted we have so many people watching online imagine the more events we could do
2:07:21
God's ready to go at supersonic speed I was in in 2021 I was flying somewhere
2:07:27
every single week to do a revival event but there's a greater cost to do revival events now it costs more literally a
2:07:33
physical cost because of the amount of people that are coming into this harvest you know so I
2:07:40
am ready i am ready to minister more i am ready to do we are ready at 5 Church to do more Revival is now events to do
2:07:47
them more frequently but we need all hands on deck to make a sacrifice and to have a heart for these
2:07:54
people to receive around the world amen i'm so grateful thank you Diane from
2:07:59
Portland we have Revival Now Portland coming up this coming week hallelujah
2:08:05
and thank you so much Diane she's funding the whole event and so we were able to Yeah that's why we have more
2:08:12
events this this month thank you for the sacrifice
2:08:18
thank you so much and so those of you that have a heart for your city it depends on the Holy Spirit leading so
2:08:23
it's not just like it has to be where Hol Holy Spirit wants the event to be but if you have a heart like Dian's to
2:08:29
bring revival to your city or your nation and you are willing to sponsor it or sponsor at least part of it reach out
2:08:35
to us amen because we can be doing more events but the funds are needed amen and
2:08:43
with that being said we have um so Five of Church is hosting all of the other events in terms of I mean funding all of
2:08:49
the other events and they're all free so we have Minnesota coming up soon and
2:08:54
Stockholm Sweden August 1st and for both of those events we still
2:09:02
need funds we still even even for London we need funds still from that one in the past like we need we there's a there's a
2:09:08
need amen um and and and God is leading us to do revival is now Paris god is
2:09:14
leading us in God's timing this year if possible but it depends on if if funds come amen so and also New Zealand
2:09:22
Auckland New Zealand god is leading us to do an event there but the same thing it it it we need there to be donations
2:09:28
there to be support for us to move forward and and book these venues and move forward with it amen so um even for
2:09:36
Paris there they require the venue that we found that we'd like to get it requires us to for some reason this one
2:09:41
requires us to give not just a down a deposit but the entire cost like $100,000 at one time
2:09:49
so if you have a heart for people in Paris if you have a heart for the people
2:09:54
in uh Stockholm if you have a heart for people in New Zealand Minnesota to receive this anointing freedom healing
2:10:02
or if you can just have a heart for your brothers and sisters cuz they are loved by God in those cities and those nations amen can you please consider donating we
2:10:10

2:10:22
you can't give on Push Pay because your country doesn't accept it there's just a small amount of countries that doesn't accept Push Pay give through PayPal and
2:10:29
write a note what it is for if you're giving here you can write on the envelope what it is for amen thank you
2:10:36
Jesus so let's sew generously so we can reap generously so we can reap enough to
2:10:42
do more events so that's a physical reaping and a spiritual reaping that will come to 5F church for the people of
2:10:48
God in the world it will be a reaping of a harvest coming into the this revival amen and when you take care of God's
