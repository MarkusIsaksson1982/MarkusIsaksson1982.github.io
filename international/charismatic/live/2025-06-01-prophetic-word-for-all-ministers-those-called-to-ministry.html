45:50
did This was a door he opened This is a big door that he only God could open Um
45:57
it doesn't happen easily you know And so I'm so grateful to God that he opened
46:02
this door And it was so exciting to talk about Jesus and talk about deliverance
46:09
talk about the power and love that Jesus has for his people in a public place
46:17
like this Of course we minister out in the park but the park you know is kind
46:23
of open to everybody But to be able to be allowed to freely share about Jesus

first This was so exciting Hallelujah And in LA and in in West

50:42
Hi Wow Thank you so much Thank you These are beautiful Thank you
50:50
So Lauren you went to Tanzania East Africa Um this past week you just
50:57
returned and you visited my spiritual father prophet Dr Davy's church in Gumayo Paco which means the roar of the
51:07
anointing That's what it translates to in Swahili and gumop Uh and we want to
51:14
hear about your experience there What happened tell us It was so amazing So as
51:21
soon as I was as soon as I was driving over there um I felt like the anointing
51:26
already hitting me very powerfully and very strongly And then um as soon as I walked in it
51:33
almost felt like I was transported into heaven Like I don't I don't really know how to describe it Like you know when you're trying to like your mind's trying
51:40
to like bring you back down to earth and I was like nope I want to stay in this heavenly realm So as soon as I walked in it was like this shift and I felt like I
51:46
was transported into heaven and um it was just the most power
51:52
of God but then also the most holiness and purity that I can describe Just like
51:57
with you you know it's like the most power but then also the most holiness Um and the only way I can
52:05
describe is I felt like a little kid Like I felt like Aba was just sitting on the altar and then I was just like his
52:10
little daughter like being held in his arms So just the purity of Jesus because I feel like a lot of people have the
52:17
power of God but they don't have that purity And so I was just shocked with the level of holiness and it was just so
52:24
like the fear of God like reverence and awe and then also just an innocence like a purity like I just felt like his
52:30
little daughter again like in his arms in his love like kind of like how it would be in heaven you know So it was
52:37
beautiful seeing all um the little kids dancing and just everyone there has this
52:43
like light about them like our spiritual family in Africa are so beautiful Um
52:49
yeah And then ever since I was little I think I told you I always felt connected to Africa but I didn't really know why
52:54
Like I always had a deep love for it and its people And this was my first time going there And I was just like I feel
53:00
like Aba put that in my heart because he knew that you're going to be my spiritual mom and the anointing and my freedom was connected to Africa So it
53:08
was just beautiful how it made like a full circle and and yeah Prophet Dr Jordavia is so like holy pure humble
53:17
powerful wise just everything that Jesus would be
53:24
[Applause] Amen Hallelujah Powerful Powerful Wow Thank you Jesus
53:32
Thank you so much for sharing And then also um when I got to meet with Prophet
53:37
Dr was ready to be one-on-one Um I got to just really see like his personality
53:44
and how humble and how much he is like Jesus And he was just making me laugh so much Like he was telling me stories how
53:51
um how when he first came to the US um and ministered I think it was in
53:56
Minnesota Yeah M Minnesota or yeah something like that And he said um that
54:01
when he was ministering there the guy introduced him and said "Yeah this is Prophet George Davyy from Africa and he
54:07
lives with giraffes and like he was just like yeah so he was like when you get back to America tell them it's safe to
54:14
come to Africa because a lot of people think they're going to get eaten by lions or something So he was like just
54:19
his personality was so funny and his wisdom and it was just such an honor to meet him and get to know him
54:26
Glory to God Hallelujah Powerful powerful

56:40
Praise God All right we're going to get into the word of God right now We're going to
56:47
go to 2 Chronicles 7:14
56:56
If my people which are called by name shall humble themselves and pray and
57:03
seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and
57:10
will forgive their sin and will heal their land We're going to read this
57:16
again If my people which are called by my name shall humble
57:23
themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will I
57:30
hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land
57:39
God is ready to move in power and bring miracles and deliverance and
57:45
healing for his people for cities and
57:50
nations that where their land has been plagued with darkness with famine with sickness with
57:58
whatever economic problems whatever the issues are he is ready to move in power
58:03
But first the people you need to humble
58:11
yourself Pray and seek his face and then he will move in power
58:19
There are many people out there many leaders in ministry and many believers
58:25
in general who are not humbling themselves and therefore are not seeing
58:32
healing in their land There's many ministers who are not humbling themselves and are therefore not
58:40
seeing healing and deliverance taking place in their church Their land in
58:46
their church and their land in their city is dry is filled with demonic
58:54
oppression simply because of this fact They are not humbling themselves and
59:01
truly seeking God's face This verse says if my people will do
59:08
this So it doesn't say pray only It says humble
59:14
themselves and pray and seek my face genuinely seek my
59:21
face not religiously seek my face but with the true fear of
59:28
God seeking him in his ways in his new wine not the ways that you
59:36
want A real humbling a real genuine prayer a real genuine seeking his face
59:45
That's what this scripture is saying It doesn't work the religious way It doesn't work just simply saying I humble
59:51
myself Words are nothing without action
1:00:01
And so I have a prophetic word today for all people in the body of Christ and
1:00:09
especially for leaders or people who feel called to ministry Maybe they are
1:00:15
not yet a leader or a minister but they are um trying to pursue a ministry of
1:00:21
some sort Maybe it's an online ministry They're making steps towards it This
1:00:27
word is for you today It starts with this this prophetic
1:00:32
word It's time to humble yourself Genuinely humble yourself Genuinely pray
1:00:38
Genuinely seek God's face And then he will release the anointing upon your
1:00:43
life and move through you And you with God's power will be the answer for your
1:00:49
church your city your state God wants to use you He uses
1:00:56
people to release his power But many people are holding
1:01:01
themselves back They are holding God back from moving in
1:01:07
power because he does not release his power any old way We have to be humble
1:01:15
We have to be obedient for his power to come in our
1:01:20
lives so he can trust us and use us
1:01:27
Matthew 22:14 Many are
1:01:33
called but few are chosen God is calling many people to
1:01:42
humble themselves and genuinely seek his face God is calling many
1:01:48
people to be vessels of his anointing
1:01:53
It says "All who believe these signs shall follow them They shall lay hands on the sick and be healed They shall cast out demons as some of these
1:02:02
signs." This isn't a promise for every so-called believer This is a promise for
1:02:08
those who will choose to be chosen For those who will be genuine true believers not fake believers not lukewarm
1:02:15
believers Not believers who refuse to get rid of their pride and ego and selfish
1:02:22
ambition This is a promise for true genuine believers So that's the meaning of many
1:02:30
are called God wants all of his believers to carry his anointing He
1:02:36
wants all of his ministers all ministers all pastors every single minister who leads
1:02:43
a church He wants all of them to be vessels of his power He wants all of
1:02:49
them to cast out demons and to heal the sick and to move in his prophetic anointing and truly speak his
1:02:57
word He wants all of them Many are called He's calling all of them
1:03:03
Hallelujah But few are chosen because few will
1:03:09
actually humble themselves Few will actually be obedient
1:03:15
to God because for so many pride is their idol before
1:03:24
God Their own desires their ego their selfish
1:03:30
ambitions is truly their idol before God
1:03:36
This is the sad reality of many believers of many so-called leaders in
1:03:43
the body of Christ And so God's calling them but
1:03:48
they refuse to be chosen We have the choice You have the choice to be a chosen
1:03:55
one Many are called meaning God is saying "Who wants to come and be used by
1:04:02
me i'm calling you Roll call Who let me see
1:04:07
your hands [Applause] Glory to
1:04:13
God But there's many holding their holding up their hands raising their hands Many people out there are raising
1:04:21
up their hands But it's an act
1:04:27
They're not meaning with their genuine heart that they will truly lay down their lives and do whatever God is
1:04:33
asking And so he looks past them and he doesn't say then come He lets them stand there with their
1:04:41
hands raised because he sees through it You can't fool God You can't fool God
1:04:47
with your lip service You can't fool God with your passionate preaching You can't fool God with your hours of prayers that
1:04:55
are full of empty words and religious rituals You can't fool God with your
1:05:03
service that is not genuinely from the heart but is with manipulation to try to get something to try to get ahead to try
1:05:08
to get connected You can't fool God He sees through it He sees the
1:05:16
heart And you can't just fake the anointing
1:05:21
God God either releases it to you or he doesn't So there's only one way to receive this
1:05:28
anointing and it's to truly repent to truly change to truly get rid of that
1:05:35
pride Lay it all down at the feet of Jesus Surrender everything and humble
1:05:41
yourself That's the only way he'll say "Okay come I choose you
1:05:54
Moses in the wilderness he would lead the people the Israelites by a a cloud
1:05:59
by day and a pillar of fire at night When the cloud moved they would
1:06:07
move When the pillar of fire moved the people
1:06:12
moved They didn't know where it was going to go when it was going to go when it was going to stop when it was going
1:06:18
to go They didn't know where which direction They had to just follow like humble children The opposite of
1:06:25
knowit-alls knowing where God's going And so God has not changed today
1:06:37
He's still requiring us to be like humble children and not be knowit alls but look
1:06:45
and see where God is going and follow the cloud follow the pillar by night
1:06:51
cloud by day What I mean by this is God has brought revival God has
1:06:58
brought moves throughout history He has brought different moves such as the move as with Moses leading the
1:07:06
Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness on the way to the promised land and a different move through that
1:07:12
was connected to his previous move But now Joshua was the anointed leader and
1:07:17
this move was to to enter the promised land and go into Jericho That was a
1:07:23
different move of God But they didn't know that God was going to call them to march around the walls
1:07:30
of Jericho They didn't know they had to follow the cloud the pillar of fire They had to
1:07:36
follow him And it doesn't make sense You can't predict You couldn't predict that he was going to say "Go around the walls
1:07:41
of Jericho seven times Seven days Seven times You couldn't predict
1:07:47
that." God has not changed You could not predict when the day of
1:07:55
Pentecost was going to come They had to wait with faith [Applause]
1:08:02
You couldn't predict when the day they would be sent out to go minister would be They had to follow the
1:08:12
cloud And so God has not changed today People try to predict revivals
1:08:18
They try to predict the next move of God They try to think they know exactly how it's going to be They have in their
1:08:25
picture this mind of what revival should look like So when God moves in a different way they don't follow the
1:08:31
cloud They keep praying for revival because they are know-it-alls and
1:08:37
prideful The cloud is moving and they're not
1:08:42
moving They're foolishly praying for revival still and they're staying in dryness They're staying oppressed
1:08:49
Ministers are staying preaching praying for revival passionately impressing
1:08:54
people with their words but people are staying stuck in bondage and sick in their churches Meanwhile the cloud is
1:09:01
moved Revival's happening And they're saying that God has called them by name They are saying they are called by
1:09:09
God but God isn't with them He is in his cloud
1:09:17
He's in his cloud and they're not following the cloud
1:09:23
It's not that God abandons you You abandon
1:09:31
God and he's waiting for you to just come follow him and he welcomes you back and he will use you in power
1:09:40
But it's up to you Humility and obedience is the only way
1:09:46
This is the state in the body of Christ today I say it even with a heavy heart today I say it with a heavy heart
1:09:52
because God has brought revival He has brought revival It has expanded across the whole world This is Jesus This is
1:09:58
his move This is his cloud moving Moving in a new way a different way than
1:10:04
people expected through servants people didn't expect People are not used to
1:10:10
deliverance People have heard of past revivals They don't think of deliverance They don't hear about deliverance They don't hear about demons But demons did
1:10:17
not cease to exist after the book of Acts
1:10:25
They continue to oppress people The devil didn't cease to bring works He
1:10:30
didn't just give up after the book of
1:10:36
Acts And his biggest goal is to bring demonic
1:10:42
oppression Because when a person is oppressed by a demon that demon has control of a part
1:10:49
of their life Like if it's if it's a demon of
1:10:56
addiction no matter how hard a person doesn't want to do drugs or drink or watch porn or
1:11:01
masturbate they they're controlled They they can't help it They try everything but they they they will literally feel
1:11:08
like they're controlled because they are in that area But if you will seek God
1:11:13
where his power is he will deliver you immediately The yoke will be destroyed
1:11:19
because of the anointing And then no demon has any control over any part of you
1:11:27
Hallelujah Hallelujah Yeah
1:11:34
So God has brought the revival that we need He's brought the re He has God has
1:11:40
done exceedingly abundantly beyond we could ever beyond whatever we could ask think dream or imagine Because people were praying for
1:11:47
revival and the way they pictured revival is like past revivals But what God has brought is greater than past
1:11:53
revival
1:12:00
What people were praying for what people were praying imagining thinking revival would look like when they were praying
1:12:06
for revival is mass amounts of salvations some miracles some
1:12:12
healings many healings But most people were not picturing deliverance
1:12:22
You can have thousands who have people saved but what if most of those people or all
1:12:29
of those people have demonic oppression
1:12:37
still if you have demonic oppression an area of you is controlled So how can you
1:12:43
be fully surrendered to God how can you walk the narrow road how can you be on fire for Jesus rather than
1:12:49
lukewarm how can you know God's love fully
1:12:59
because you're crying and praying for freedom in this area but it's not
1:13:06
happening You're trying everything but you're still bound How can you know God's love fully
1:13:14
it's not supposed to be like that The church is supposed to have the power of God
1:13:19
So when when a person comes to Jesus and they need deliverance and they're crying
1:13:25
out for for Jesus to deliver them God answers them that very day or the next
1:13:30
day as they show up to the church or they show up virtually where the power of God is And immediately the demon has
1:13:36
to go The demon has to go
1:13:44
So that's that's what church is supposed to look like That people would the
1:13:50
de Paul says "I didn't come to you with wise and persuasive words but I came to you with a demonstration of God's power
1:13:58
I came to you with a demonstration of God's power so that your faith would not rest on man's words for it but your
1:14:05
faith would rest on the power of God." When your faith is rested on God's power
1:14:10
it mean the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power So when you're really encountering God's power
1:14:17
you're getting to know who Jesus really is That his love is the most extreme kind of love that it that his love is
1:14:24
demonstrated through power Through the greatest kind of power more powerful than any kind of
1:14:32
bomb more powerful than a lightning strike
1:14:37
more powerful than the brightest light bulbs we have more powerful than the sun
1:14:43
God's power the level of his power reveals his level of love for you
1:14:50
And so with the you know you you you're in bondage your whole life The devil's
1:14:55
devil's torturing you tormenting you in different areas of
1:15:00
your life You come to the church where God's power is God's power is demonstrated and immediately you are
1:15:07
free You are free from chains you were bound in for maybe all of your life And
1:15:13
in one moment you are completely free And you can now know the love of
1:15:23
God It's not the only way that God shows his love through deliverance But if you are bound you won't know the the the
1:15:30
love of God like he wants you to know it until you're free You weren't meant to
1:15:36
be bound Jesus it says in the Bible this is the reason the son of man came to
1:15:42
destroy the works of the devil John 10:10 the devil came to steal kill and
1:15:48
destroy but I Jesus have come to bring abundant
1:15:58
life People need to know this Jesus who destroys the works of the devil and
1:16:05
brings abundant life It's ministers responsibilities
1:16:13
first to represent Jesus rightly to reveal who Jesus really is to people
1:16:23
If you're not carrying the power of God you are not doing the job that God has asked you to do You are not representing
1:16:29
him rightly The kingdom of God is not a matter of
1:16:34
talk but of power So if the power is not in your church the kingdom of God is not
1:16:41
[Applause]
1:16:46
there It's a club It's a gathering It's a
1:16:52
show It's a fellowship But it's not the kingdom of God
1:17:00
I speak this with a heavy heart today I speak this as a serious word because
1:17:06
this is not day one of revival And I realize this now as I'm speaking
1:17:12
this is prophetic because it has been now four years to this week that God has brought revival
1:17:19
globally [Applause]
1:17:26
He he began in January with viral videos His power
1:17:32
moving January of 20 January 2021 Technically December 31st of
1:17:39

Jesus is your Lord every year is a good year
1:18:11
Hallelujah I thank God for 2020 because on the last day of that year God brought revival
1:18:18
Hallelujah The promise came to pass The walls of Jericho came down when the world needed it I remember that
1:18:24
day looking through comments so many people saying I have I had COVID symptoms and they left when I watched
1:18:29
this one minute video The one minute video that I put out that's God's power moved through the video and it went viral and there was thousands of
1:18:36
comments people testifying to miracles I received while watching the video That was the beginning of the revival breaking
1:18:41
out and then it kept growing as videos continued to go viral I kept going live every single I would go live twice a
1:18:48
week every week at first um in addition to Sundays So three times a week going live and there was an online revival
1:18:55
People were watching all over the world People were testifying of miracles they were receiving while watching online and um that led to a woman coming
1:19:03
traveling across the country from Massachusetts on May 21st 2021 and a
1:19:08
demon manifested in her and Jesus cast it out And that was the first demon that was cast out at 5F Church And that glory
1:19:15
to God And that deliverance went viral and just led to this revival increasing so much to where that day May 21st 2021
1:19:24
about 25 or so people were there at the church outside in the amphitheater And two months later May 30th 2021 300
1:19:32
people came to 5F Church The amphitheater was overflowing And from there hundreds have come to 5F Church
1:19:39
every week From that day people travel from all around the country From a
1:19:44
couple months later to that day people travel from all over the world Every single week up until now four years later people have traveled from
1:19:51
different countries You hear it every single week Our international visitors that are here every single week since
1:19:56
then This is revival Glory to
1:20:04
God Glory to God So it's so prophetic that the Lord is speaking this message
1:20:11
on this week on this anniversary of when he made revival go global all over the
1:20:18
world And when hundreds for the first time came to 5F church when we were out in the park four years ago this week he
1:20:26
has brought revival Revival has been here Revival is here now and it's just
1:20:31
the beginning still It's going to keep growing It's going to keep
1:20:38
increasing But this is revival that God has brought This isn't a movement for
1:20:44
one church I repeat this isn't a movement for one
1:20:52
church
1:20:58
This isn't some sort of church ministry minister going
1:21:03
viral story It's not that This is revival This is genuinely
1:21:11
truly revival that people have prayed for that you have prayed for your parents your grandparents your
1:21:16
great-grandparents have prayed for for decades It is here This is revival
1:21:28
Glory to God
1:21:37
This is the cloud This is the pillar of fire This is where God is right
1:21:45
now I don't mean just at 5F Church I just said this is this is not about a
1:21:53
move of God in one church
1:22:00
But this revival what God is doing how he is anointing and calling apostles and
1:22:08
prophets and putting his powerful anointing in
1:22:14
them How he is moving in power to set the captives free
1:22:20
to break generational curses every kind of bondage of the devil every kind of
1:22:26
demonic spirit every spirit of witchcraft like that He is freeing people quick and easy like that because
1:22:33
he's so powerful It's not a struggle It's not
1:22:38
hurting a person for them to get delivered but they're being free with
1:22:44
ease by his power With
1:22:49
simplicity and great power God is moving This is the cloud The cloud is
1:22:57
Jesus moving to set the captives free right now The cloud is Jesus moving in power to heal every kind of sickness
1:23:03
raising the dead This is the
1:23:09
cloud God raises leaders God anointed Moses God anointed
1:23:16
Joshua God anointed Elijah God anointed Elisha God anointed Peter God anointed
1:23:21
Paul to be leaders who carried this anointing
1:23:28
Glory to God Glory to God
1:23:39
This revival I repeat is not for one church but we're used to seeing like in
1:23:46
the history a church grow and become a mega church or something or a lot of popularity be upon a church or the
1:23:54
pastor of the church go viral or something And so there's a lot of growth and buzz around that church We're used
1:24:01
to like these popular ministries and we're used to them being so like
1:24:08
singular I mean isolated like their own thing But what I'm trying to tell you
1:24:14
what God is speaking is that this is not that This is revival for the whole body of Christ
1:24:22
[Applause] Hallelujah Yes God is moving so
1:24:28
powerfully here at 5F Church His cloud is here The fire the pillar of fire is
1:24:35
here Glory to God And by his grace he has put anointing in me and called me to
1:24:40
be an apostle Called me to be a leader But he doesn't want his cloud to only be
1:24:46
over 5F church He doesn't want revival to be only in 5F church He doesn't want me to
1:24:54
be the only anointed person minister or just one of a handful of
1:25:00
anointed ministers He wants the whole body of
1:25:07
Christ to recognize his revival and recognize where his cloud is and come
1:25:12
and be a part No longer be divided no longer be doing your own thing putting
1:25:18
your head down not looking where the cloud is and missing the cloud because you're so focused on your own life your
1:25:25
own ambitions your own ego your own ministry how people think of you putting
1:25:31
your head down and missing that the cloud is over here Not seeing fruits in your ministry People staying oppressed
1:25:38
and the sick staying sick Missing the cloud when you could
1:25:43
come join the cloud Come join the move of God and receive the anointing and
1:25:50
bring the anointing to your church and have revival in your church And your church would be a place where the cloud
1:25:57
is too
1:26:05
It says in Acts 9:10 in Damascus there was a disciple
1:26:11
named Ananas The Lord called him in a vision An annihas Yes Lord he answered
1:26:16
The Lord told him "Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man named
1:26:22
Tarsus named Saul For he is praying." Now I'm going to pause right here to give you context Saul was persecuting
1:26:29
and even murdering Christians thinking he was serving God thinking he was called by God to stop these false
1:26:38
prophets which were truly servants of God
1:26:43
But he was determined that this was the work of God God was calling him to do That he was called by God to stop these
1:26:50
false prophets But he was completely deceived
1:26:55
by his pride But Jesus in his grace blinded him revealed himself to
1:27:03
him Saul why are you persecuting me this is me This is really me that
1:27:12
you've been saying is the devil God was saying to Paul
1:27:18
Saul what you're saying is false is true And as you
1:27:24
persecute my servants you are persecuting me because I'm the one who called them and I'm the one who gave
1:27:30
them the power and I'm the one moving through them This is what you're actually doing Saul
1:27:37
There's a lot of souls today doing the same thing more prevalent today than I've
1:27:44
ever seen it But it's because the way Jesus is moving
1:27:52
through servants of God today in this revival true servants is like what we saw in the book
1:27:59
of Acts when Saul was persecuting them like never before because revival
1:28:05
has come The revival of the as restoration of the axe church has
1:28:11
come So so we will also see everything We'll see what we saw in the axe church
1:28:17
We will see the persecution as well When the glory rises and the power
1:28:23
rises so does the persecution But nothing can stop the work of God It
1:28:28
encourages us It encourages us And God calls us
1:28:34
blessed and we always have the victory Hallelujah So this is the context This
1:28:41
is when Jesus appeared to Saul and Saul finally realized he was wrong and his
1:28:46
eyes were opened up in the spiritual realm but not yet physically So then God
1:28:52
appears to Ananas a true servant of God whom God called and anointed and it says
1:29:00
in a vision in a vision he has seen a man named Ananas come and place his hands on him to restore his sight So
1:29:07
Saul has seen this vision Saul that's now going to become Paul Lord Ananas answered I have heard
1:29:14
many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem And he has come here with
1:29:20
authority from the chief priests to arrest all who come call on your name But the Lord said to Ananas "Go This man
1:29:28
is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel I will show him
1:29:34
how much he must suffer for my name." So because God saw that Saul repented
1:29:43
genuinely and humbled himself even though his past was
1:29:48
horrible as bad as it can get Jesus saw he could use him He had a
1:29:55
heart he could use because he humbled himself and truly sought God in that
1:30:01
moment where God opened up his spiritual eyes So he was ready to use him You see
1:30:07
how quickly God is ready to use people if they will only humble themselves This becomes the
1:30:14
hardest stumbling block for most people is to humble themselves But it's truly that that
1:30:21
quick and easy God wants to use more than they want to be used by
1:30:26
God because that's his way his main way of coming in power to deliver and heal
1:30:32
people and reveal his love to people and speak is through vessels
1:30:39
So as soon as Saul could truly humble himself God was ready to use him God was
1:30:45
ready to anoint him So Paul
1:30:52
said or I'm sorry Ananas and uh I will show you then and then then Ananas went
1:30:58
to the house and entered it Placing his hands on Saul he said brother Saul the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the
1:31:05
road as you were coming here has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy
1:31:13
Spirit Immediately something like scales fell from Saul's eyes and he could see again and he got up and was
1:31:23
baptized Do you see the humility in
1:31:29
Ananas because Ananas was one of the ones that Saul would have been
1:31:35
persecuting But Ananas was truly a servant of
1:31:40
God He was truly a servant He was truly obedient He was truly humble
1:31:48
There wasn't offense in him because there wasn't pride in him Offense would have kept him from
1:31:56
being used by God to open up Saul's eyes and welcome him as a brother and
1:32:03
fellow servant of God But back in the Acts church there
1:32:10
was purity prevalent in true servants of God
1:32:15
There was true purity in hearts If you're pure in heart offense
1:32:22
doesn't stick onto you when the devil tries to throw it at you Bitterness doesn't stick onto
1:32:29
you When you're pure in heart when you're pure in heart you've truly died to yourself And when you really die to
1:32:34
yourself you don't have ego anymore You don't have pride anymore
1:32:41
And God will take you through persecution after persecution where people drag your name in the mud so much
1:32:50
that there is not an ounce of pride left in you anymore
1:32:56
But it's because you said "Okay Lord they can drag my name through the mud
1:33:01
and I will still serve you I will still obey you I will still keep my mouth
1:33:07
quiet and my heart clean and I won't speak against them but I will endure
1:33:12
this persecution for your sake When you keep doing that God takes every ounce of
1:33:18
pride out of you where you are no longer you are no longer living but it is
1:33:24
Christ who is living in you You don't know what it's like to have
1:33:30
pride and ego All you know is that you are a servant of the Lord Let it be done to me as you have said Lord
1:33:39
When anything happens in your life that the first thing that comes out of your heart let it be done to me Lord I am a
1:33:46
servant of you Like Mary said that's what
1:33:52
happens if you will really die to yourself and endure that persecution
1:33:57
Persecution is beautiful because that's where he takes all the pride out
1:34:03
People bash you People say the worst kind of things about you So many people think so wrongly about
1:34:09
you because of what people said about you falsely accused you of but you keep your eyes on
1:34:19
Jesus You keep your eyes on Jesus You keep your eyes on Jesus and
1:34:26
you keep marching forward doing what God has called you to do You see God wants
1:34:31
this persecution to happen He's allowing it for my good Let it be done to me as you have said for I am a servant of the
1:34:37
Lord
1:34:43
I get emotional I got emotional when I was reading this scripture because this purity in Ananas is
1:34:53
rare How many leaders in the body of Christ would do what Ananas did
1:35:09
i want to tell you everybody in the body of Christ every minister every pastor
1:35:14
every leader if God asks me to release this
1:35:19
anointing that I carry to you to impart it to you I will do it
1:35:26
I will do it with joy Even Even you who
1:35:34
have dragged my name through the mud and said false accusations about me done
1:35:41
evil things If God asked me to do what he asked Ananas to do for Saul who
1:35:49
became Paul and God has a plan for you to become like
1:35:54
Paul I will do it I will release this anointing to
1:36:01
you I want to see other ministries I want to see other churches have revival
1:36:09
I don't want it to be just here
1:36:21
This is what God is calling all believers all leaders to come to the cloud and receive this
1:36:30
anointing because it's here for you I am not hoarding
1:36:35
it I don't have pride about this anointing This is God's
1:36:44
I don't have pride because God has taken me through
1:36:49
it You become changed when you go through the things I've gone
1:36:54
through You become transformed to not be yourself anymore but just live for
1:37:00
Christ And so when God says to do something okay no hesitation no
1:37:07
wrestling your heart only wants 100% not 90% 100% wants what God wants
1:37:15
[Applause]
1:37:22
1 Corinthians 3:3 for you are living your lives do
1:37:29
dominated by the mindset of the flesh This is a lot of people in the
1:37:35
body of Christ These are this is a lot of leaders today in the body of Christ Ask
1:37:40
yourselves is there jealousy among you do you compare yourself with
1:37:49
others do you quarrel like children and end up taking
1:37:55
sides if so this proves that you are living your lives centered on
1:38:03
yourselves dominated by the mindset of the flesh and behaving like unbelievers
1:38:14
I see this today in the body of Christ I see this on YouTube more than I've ever
1:38:20
seen it in my short life of 34 years Anyone else
1:38:29
for when you divide yourselves up in groups a Paul group and Apollo's group
1:38:36
you're acting like people without the spirit's influence
1:38:44
I'm going to fast forward now to verse 18 Let no one deceive himself If anyone
1:38:49
among you thinks that he is wise in this age let him become a fool discarding his
1:38:55
worldly pretensions and acknowledging his lack of wisdom so that he may become
1:39:01
truly wise For the wisdom of this world is foolishness absurdity stupidity
1:39:10
There's a lot of Christians who are acting completely
1:39:16
foolish and in complete stupidity because of the center the the
1:39:23
the the the the living their lives centered on themselves dominated by the mindset of the flesh as this passage
1:39:30
speaks about For the wisdom of this world is foolishness absurdity stupidity
1:39:36
stupidity before God For it is written in scripture he is the one who catches the wise and clever in their craftiness
1:39:42
The passion translation says for what the world says is wisdom is actually foolishness in God's eyes As it is written the cleverness of the knowit
1:39:50
alls becomes the trap that ens snares them
1:40:02
So we have this Apollo's group Paul's group We have all these divisions in the body of Christ today when we're supposed
1:40:08
to truly be united We're all like "Oh yeah Love your brothers and sisters." And that's as far as it goes Oh you're a
1:40:14
fellow believer Praise God Hey family member in Christ That's as far as it goes But where is the unity among
1:40:21
Christian leaders where is the unity among ministries
1:40:28
it's so divided It's so self-centered for the most part It's become
1:40:37
empires and like celebrity
1:40:45
culture but we are supposed to be all united in the body of Christ
1:40:51
We are so we we are supposed to be a kingdom of God on this
1:40:58
earth We're supposed to be part of a kingom
1:41:04
A kingdom is not divided It's connected
1:41:10
on the same team And God has given gifts to the body of
1:41:17
Christ Ephesians 4:11 Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church The apostles the prophets
1:41:23
the evangelists and the pastors and teachers These are the gifts God gave to the church The respons their
1:41:30
responsibility is to equip God's people to do his work and build up the church the body of Christ This will continue So
1:41:37
that includes the equipping of the apostles and prophets will continue in addition to evangelists pastors and
1:41:42
teachers This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God's son that we will be
1:41:48
mature in the Lord measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ
1:41:53
Then we will no longer be immature like children We won't be tossed and blown
1:41:58
about by every wind of new teaching We will be influenced when people try to trick us We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so
1:42:04
clever they sound like truth Instead we will speak the truth in love growing in every way more and more like Christ who
1:42:10
is the head of his body the church He makes the whole body fit together perfectly As each part does its own
1:42:15
special work it helps the other parts grow so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of
1:42:23
love But but so many people take this passage and they think it's supposed to
1:42:29
mean for church by church by church Like every church should have
1:42:36
their five-fold ministry and they're their own thing completely separate from
1:42:41
any other ministry and the rest of the body of Christ This is talking about the
1:42:46
whole body We in the Acts church our example of
1:42:52
what church is supposed to be like today our example of what the body of Christ should be like today This is what Paul is speaking
1:42:58
against Paul's group Apollo's group Yes there are different churches but
1:43:05
we're not supposed to be so divided like this
1:43:12
So it's like it's it's this is not how God works He doesn't go to every church
1:43:17
and um anoint
1:43:24
somebody Anoint somebody as an apostle Anoint somebody as prophet
1:43:33
And a light comes down upon the person in the third row in the
1:43:39
middle and the audible voice of God speaks He or she Susie or Bill is the
1:43:46
chosen apostle now And immediately they become the
1:43:52
leader of the church and demons are cast out and the sick are healed and miracles happen in everywhere And God does that
1:43:58
for every church Or God gives a vision to the
1:44:04
current leader of the church Whoa Tom is the chosen prophet of this church
1:44:13
Tom come here God doesn't work like
1:44:20
that His cloud doesn't work that way He anoints leaders rises raises up
1:44:28
leaders that people don't expect that a lot of people don't like because it doesn't fit into their box
1:44:39
He He raises up weak and foolish things to confound the wisdom of this world The
1:44:44
know-it-alls the know-it-alls don't like it generally pretty much all the time They
1:44:50
don't like it They don't like who God chooses The weak and foolish ones Um God
1:44:58
raises up servants of God around the world puts his anointing highlights them
1:45:05
reveals the fruit through them so that the whole body of Christ globally can
1:45:10
see where his cloud is So the whole body of Christ can
1:45:15
recognize this is a chosen apostle This is a chosen prophet This is a chosen evangelist a chosen pastor a chosen
1:45:23
teacher who is truly anointed who has fruits that I want and I need in my
1:45:32
ministry This is Apostle Paul of today This is Apostle Peter of today This is
1:45:37
Philip the Evangelist of today This is a leader whom God has anointed and called
1:45:43
It is obvious by the fruits And so therefore since we are all a body
1:45:49
we are all one And God has given to the the body not just one church one church
1:45:54
one church The body he has given gifts So I need this gift if I want to be
1:46:01
equipped I need this gift if I want to know the secrets and mysteries I'm missing about the kingdom of heaven
1:46:08
because they are not revealed to everybody Jesus speaks of this The Pharisees they cannot understand what
1:46:16
I'm preaching He says "Father I praise you for hiding these things about your
1:46:21
kingdom from those who are wise and proud and only revealing it to the humble and the childlike."
1:46:28
[Applause]
1:46:34
So this is God's way He anoints people like how he anointed Paul and Peter and
1:46:39
the apostles and the evangelist pastors and teachers in the book of acts He anoints them in the global body of
1:46:46
Christ And in this revival this is very important It's like a Moses moment
1:46:51
There's leaders in his revival where he is showing this is the
1:46:57
cloud Come and receive this revelation knowledge you don't have about my
1:47:04
kingdom Come and receive impartation of this anointing Come be a disciple
1:47:10
here so you can carry revival in your
1:47:18
ministry and for every believer in your life in your city
1:47:27
God called me and he didn't just um download all of the
1:47:33
revelations just boom in my mind But he gave me a spiritual father
1:47:41
prophet Dr Joe Davyy who is a true chosen anointed prophet of
1:47:47
God in the body of Christ today Not just in his church not just in his city not just
1:47:53
in his nation in the whole body of Christ
1:48:01
And I humbled myself I became like a child And I listened and I learned I
1:48:07
became a true disciple I listened and I learned Revelation after revelation of
1:48:13
the kingdom of God I humbled myself so that God could
1:48:18
trust me with this anointing so that my spiritual father
1:48:23
could release the anointing upon my life I humbled myself to be the opposite
1:48:30
of a know-it-all and be like a child and just receive and learn knowing I know
1:48:37
nothing I become like a child And that's how I'm able to have this revelation I'm
1:48:42
able to preach I'm able to carry the anointing and fruits are can be seen It's all because of humbling myself and
1:48:48
going where the cloud was being
1:48:54
obedient Now here I am in in my in my my church This isn't this isn't a branch of
1:49:02
Prophet Joe Davy's ministry This is this is a five of church branch where I am the leader of this church And now the
1:49:08
anointing's moving and revival's here But but it didn't come from me being
1:49:17
prideful and doing things in my own
1:49:23
way It came from humbling myself and being obedient to go where God showed me to go When God said "I want this is your
1:49:30
spiritual father You are called to be a disciple and receive from him receive this revelation from him receive
1:49:36
impartation of anointing from him." I said "Okay Lord Yes Lord." And I'm so
1:49:42
unashamed of that This is God's beautiful way I am so unashamed to follow this cloud I'm so happy to follow
1:49:49
up the cloud of God to now be able to bring this cloud here
1:49:55

1:50:30
whoever you are if you are really called by God or you say you're called by God
1:50:37
God's calling you to humble yourself and come and receive
1:50:43
humble yourself and see that you don't have the
1:50:49
anointing You don't humble yourself and be real with
1:50:56
this reality and see that you are not in God's will until you're carrying the anointing
1:51:04
Ministers follow the cloud Receive the anointing Receive impartation and bring it to your church
1:51:10
Bring it to your city Bring it to your nation Heal the sick Cast out demons Raise the dead Preach the word with the
1:51:18

1:51:38

1:51:47
Revival could be happening in every church around the world
1:51:55
Many are called he is calling every ministry leader many ministry leaders to
1:52:03
humble themselves and receive what they don't have Receive this anointing Receive this nuine
1:52:09
revelation Receive this equipping
1:52:16
That's what God is calling right now Calling you Every church every church in
1:52:22
America could America in the world could have the power of God Could be casting out demons and healing the sick Everyone
1:52:27
could Every pastor could Every minister could That's what God wants
1:52:36
Why are you watching me pastors ministers why are you watching
1:52:42
me why are you sitting there and watching me why are you sitting there watching me
1:52:49
with jealousy why are you sitting there watching me comparing yourself why are you sitting there bashing what
1:52:55
you want come and receive Humble yourself
1:53:00
[Applause] [Music]
1:53:12
I'm serious I'm serious You're used to seeing ministers who carry anointing and
1:53:19
have big followings or something that they're about themselves And that's why it's so easy
1:53:25
for you to hate them and be jealous because you think that it's not for you that they don't want to share it
1:53:32
but they want it for their empire They want to keep it to themselves That's what you're used to And you have
1:53:38
that in yourself many of you in your heart This is not that here
1:53:46
The Bible says "Freely you have received freely give [Music]
1:53:55
There's there's proof of this There's ministers there's ministers who are here Min ministers who are here ministers who
1:54:01
testified last week of receiving impartation of anointing Even the one
1:54:06
last week she's from Mexico She was on this stage testifying
1:54:12
and she she received impartation by watching online even
1:54:21
and and miracles are happening in her church now Her and her husband miracles
1:54:27
are happening People are being healed and delivered That was not happening before She's much older than me The
1:54:33
pastors here that are here today they're much older than me But they received it and they received
1:54:39
it quickly and they started to immediately see miracles take place in their church Many people are here are
1:54:44
the fruit of it They've been freed They've been freed
1:54:51
They've they've attended they've attended Pas Pas Pastor
1:54:57
Heather and Pastor Larry's church They've attended it and they've been set free because of the impartation they
1:55:03
have received And Pastor Heather received the
1:55:11
impartation almost four years ago Only like three weeks of coming to 5F Church
1:55:16
She received the impartation of anointing She went to her church and that week a demon manifested and left
1:55:22
somebody who was has suicidal
1:55:30
thoughts This is real I'm not just saying this
1:55:36
This is what God wants to give you I'm serious
1:55:42
I really want you to know my heart I really want you to know God's heart I really want you to know this is different here
1:55:49
Because this is urgent People in your church should not be stained with demons and stained with sickness
1:55:58
When you can simply humble yourself pray seek God's face and he will heal your
1:56:05
land He will heal the people in your church quickly
1:56:12
There's probably millions of Christians all over the world sitting in churches staying with demons
1:56:18
It does not have to be that way They could be freed right now
1:56:26
But we we have to do it God's way You have to be humble
1:56:31
You have to be humble There's no other way
1:56:36
It's worth it to humble yourself Can I tell you it's worth it
1:56:42
having no pride in you anymore is such a more peaceful and joyful and fulfilling
1:56:47
life When you have pride you you you think
1:56:53
you like it I must be because you're so reluctant to get rid of it
1:56:58
But the devil's fooling you He's playing you
1:57:05
completely playing you cuz he knows what happens when you humble yourself
1:57:13
He knows the people in your church will be healed and delivered He knows revival will break out Your church will become
1:57:18
massive for God's glory He knows you will be lifted God will bless you way more than the devil could
1:57:24
bless you Devil never blesses He takes and takes
1:57:39
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness absurdity stupidity It is foolish to keep your pride I'll tell you
1:57:44
that it's absurdity and stupidity to keep your pride
1:57:50
[Music]
1:57:57
I feel the righteous anger of God for the the ministers out there the leaders
1:58:03
who are hanging so tightly onto their pride Hypocrites
1:58:10
saying you love God but hating God's people because you won't do what's necessary Humble yourself to receive the
1:58:17
anointing so the people in the church can be healed and free I don't care if you preach a good word
1:58:25
You don't love the people if you're not freeing them and healing them by God's
1:58:35
power Praise God For the wisdom of this world is foolishness absurdity stupidity before
1:58:41
God For it is written he is the one who catches the wise and clever in their
1:58:48
craftiness The Passion translation says "The cleverness of the know-it-alls becomes the trap that ens snares them."
1:58:57
The cleverness of the know-it-alls of the prideful ones of the jealous ones of
1:59:04
the ones who try to push somebody down to try to get ahead It becomes the trap
1:59:10
that ins snares them It becomes the trap of the devil that keeps them from being somebody whom God is not with That keeps
1:59:17
them from being a vessel who God anoints to deliver and heal God's people It keeps them from fulfilling their purpose
1:59:23
It keeps them from pleasing God It keeps them from be from being lifted for God's glory It keeps them from having abundant
1:59:33
life So I want to I want to I want to challenge all the the the ministers out there and the whole body of Christ I
1:59:40
want to challenge you to be real with yourself Is there pride there you will
1:59:47
know if there is Is there pride is there jealousy is there comparison is there
1:59:54
selfish ambition if there is you're being
2:00:01
foolish You're giving into this enemy's trap that's ins snaring you
2:00:08
If there is you are missing the cloud of God All you have to do is humble
2:00:13
yourself If my people will humble themselves pray and seek my face I will
2:00:19
heal their land He will bring this anointing upon you to heal your
2:00:28
land Hallelujah Thank you Jesus
2:00:35
Thank you Jesus So I want to invite every pastor
2:00:42
and minister from around the world Come and be a disciple Come and
2:00:48
receive anointing It's not about me touching your head and that's it You go on your
2:00:53
merry way That anointing will dry up
2:00:59
The way impartation of anointing comes is through the principle of spiritual mother or fatherhood Being a true
2:01:05
disciple like Elisha was to Elijah Elisha didn't just come serve him for a moment and dip
2:01:12
out He st he stuck by him unashamedly He wasn't ashamed of Elijah And that's how
2:01:17
the mantle came upon his life [Applause]
2:01:26
Timothy received impartation of anointing from Paul but he stuck
2:01:32
unashamedly with Paul and was was was submissive to that leadership He was
2:01:37
respectful and loyal and obedient And that's how Paul could trust him That's why Paul calls him his
2:01:44
beloved spiritual son so often telling the people "I can trust him He's an
2:01:49
amazing spiritual son of mine Listen to what he says He's going to carry my words So um this anointing that I'm
2:01:57
talking about you need the revelation to walk in it It's not like
2:02:04
here's the power here you go like a transaction You need the revelation of
2:02:10
how to walk in it You need the equipping And how that comes is by really being a disciple
2:02:16
So ministers and pastors out there I want to call you to come and receive impartation of anointing If if you're
2:02:23
not able to travel to LA immediately that's okay Um if that's not possible
2:02:29
financially or something right in this moment but but but believe God is going to provide and make a sacrifice But there was a woman receiving impartation
2:02:35
even from being online But the people that these pastors that we have these testimonies of they've actually become
2:02:42
disciples The church that I mentioned here Pastor
2:02:48
Heather has been coming for four years every single Sunday She only missed like two or three or something ever because
2:02:54
she had to for some reason She's come every single time Pastor Larry comes now
2:02:59
too But from like hour and a half drive one way
2:03:05
brings her church
2:03:10
But they're their own they're their own church But you see how there's that unity
2:03:19
They're their own church but we are one team
2:03:26
And I want your church to thrive I want church your church to have more revival Hallelujah And I celebrate this revival
2:03:34
at their church in Redlands
2:03:41
The one received an impartation from online She's a true disciple She they are watching the teachings every week
2:03:48
They are learning They are being equipped They are serving Serving by
2:03:56
sharing what God is doing Sharing videos sharing testimonies sewing into the work of God
2:04:02
here Contributing to God's work That's how part of how you sew
2:04:07
They were being real disciples So you can be a disciple a spiritual son or daughter but have your own church
2:04:15
Like you can be a spiritual son or daughter of me for example receive impartation receive equipping be a disciple and have your own
2:04:23
church But you have to be a real disciple You have to be unashshamed of this anointing and where you received it
2:04:29
from And the devil will test that like he tested me where I received my impartation of anointing from my
2:04:36
spiritual father The devil tried to dis tried to
2:04:43
come with the most intimidating spirit with the aim at trying to disconnect me from my spiritual father because he
2:04:48
knows the spiritual principle of being a real disciple and staying connected to where you have received from and where
2:04:55
you continue to receive
2:05:00
But because I love God more than myself more than my ego because I I've chosen
2:05:06
to obey God with my life the devil couldn't fool me tempt me a second
2:05:12
Get behind me Satan I say and I will continue to say and I
2:05:18
unashamely am proud to say that I'm a spiritual daughter of my spiritual father Prophet Dr George Davyy
2:05:27
And I'm so grateful for his life and grateful for this true prophet of God Grateful for this gift that God has
2:05:34
given to the body of Christ that I needed that we need
2:05:40
Hallelujah So I'm just sharing with you what it means what what God is calling to you
2:05:46
right now You have to be unashamed to be a real disciple and take it seriously And if you will do
2:05:53
that that's it The anointing will flow powerfully in your life and move through you in your ministry and it will not dry
2:06:00
up and it will keep [Applause] increasing If you want to be a chosen
2:06:06
one God is calling you God is calling you The invitation is open I challenge
2:06:12
you I invite you I urge you as a fellow servant of
2:06:17
God I urge you come and follow the cloud
2:06:23
Come and join God's revival Make him proud Please him Be after his
2:06:30
heart and heal your land by his power Heal and deliver your people in your
2:06:38
church in your ministry in your city by God's power moving through you
2:06:44

2:08:02

2:08:11
We saw you from Instagram since you were ministering in the parks
2:08:16
[Music]
2:08:25
He pastors the church and he also moves in deliverance But they felt that it was
2:08:30
the same spirit talking to them
2:08:44
I saw a preaching of you where you were saying if you were a pastor you have to come and I said I we have to go We
2:08:52
really have to go [Applause]
2:09:12
God spoke to him and he told them to come here to the United States They didn't know that it was here but they're
2:09:18
here to take that impartation for the glory of God to Ecuador Amen
2:09:25
Hallelujah I am proud of you both And God is so proud of
2:09:31
you for hearing his call and obeying quickly
2:09:39
Immediately Many are called and few are chosen You heard his
2:09:45
call And I hear God saying now "I'm choosing
2:09:51
you I've chosen you." Because you've humbled yourself and
2:09:59
obeyed And God is releasing this anointing to you now
2:10:06
and miracles will begin to take place mightily in your church
2:10:15
Demons will go with ease They will fear you and
2:10:22
leave Many will be set free and
2:10:27
healed and revival will spread through you
2:10:33
Hallelujah I release this anointing to you now May the power of God come in you and
2:10:42
move through you Let miracles take place Let the oppressed be free the sick
2:10:48
healed Let revival spread Receive this now in Jesus name
2:10:56
Receive this anointing May God use you in new ways in his power
2:11:05
Receive it now in Jesus name
2:11:10
Hallelujah Hallelujah Praise [Applause]
2:11:18
God Revival is now Hallelujah
2:11:24
Hallelujah Hallelujah Praise God Praise God They will never be the same They
2:11:32
will never be the same It's time for Revival Ecuador
2:11:39
It's happening now Hallelujah Hallelujah Thank you
2:11:46
Jesus Thank you Jesus We're going to give to God right now
2:11:55
Hallelujah Thank you Jesus
2:12:01
Thank you Jesus One of the big ways that the anointing
2:12:07
comes upon your life is by serving by serving the work of God This
2:12:12
is what Elisha did for Elijah Elisha was serving Elijah So he was serving the ministry
2:12:20
that Elijah was the leader of the work of God And he kept serving him and serving
2:12:27
him and serving him And the this was this was what made part of what made a big part of what
2:12:34
made the anointing come upon his life And to serve God means to to serve
2:12:40
God to serve him in his work means to contribute to the work of
2:12:47
God in any way contributing to the work of God So that looks like a lot of
2:12:53
different things That looks like using your skills and your gifts assisting
2:12:58
with everything that needs to happen for church to to take place It means sharing the good news sh
2:13:07
spreading the good news far and wide sharing what God is doing so that more people can come into the kingdom So that
2:13:14
the work of God can take place in their lives that they can hear the word they
2:13:20
can be healed and be delivered It also means sewing That's a part of contributing to God's work Because just
2:13:27
as much as we need Christine to play the piano Steve to play the guitar Wesson to
2:13:33
play the drums Tia to Tia to play the drums to play the bass guitar and everybody here
2:13:40
Austin to run the screen and all the ushers everyone who
2:13:46
comes early puts out chairs serves in the lobby serves after films testimonies
2:13:52
Just as much as we need all of them can you imagine church without all of
2:13:58
them no It's possible because of them Just as we need their gifts and their
2:14:05
talents we also need sers Or else we wouldn't be here right
2:14:10
now in this place that costs several thousands of dollars every week We wouldn't be in the venue and that we're
2:14:16
going to be in in London coming up and the other events coming up We wouldn't be able to do it We wouldn't have a
2:14:22
venue without the financial donations So it plays just an important
2:14:30
part You see it's part of serving God Amen And so when you contribute to
2:14:37
God's work it's proving that you are going to be a good steward with the
2:14:43
anointing When you're faithful with little you'll be faithful with more So he cannot pour the anointing in you
2:14:49
until he can see that you're really about the father's business That you're really about preaching the good news
2:14:54
healing the sick casting the de casting out demons You're really about this work of God That's right cuz every part is
2:15:01
important Every part every part is needed So you got to have a heart for it
2:15:07
all Amen So I want to invite all of you This word is for this word I shared is
2:15:15
for everybody It's for ministers It's for leaders but it's also for everybody who feels called to ministry It's for
2:15:20
everybody because God calls everyone to carry the anointing to be a vessel of God's power whether you're a five-fold
2:15:26
minister and have a church or not And so I'm I'm briefly sharing with you right now one of the ways that God can see
2:15:33
it's one of the humbling parts one of the humbling parts that God speaks about one of the ways you humble yourself is
2:15:40
by serving God is by sewing continually contributing to God's work being generous Amen So I want to
2:15:48
invite you right now I want to encourage you that your seeds are so powerful and they are so needed They are so needed
2:15:54
with the greater things that God has called us to do this year Amen So if you'd like to sew you can
