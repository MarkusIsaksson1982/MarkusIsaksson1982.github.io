 Now I heard I was told that you have a testimony. Can you share that?
 I don't know what to say. Like every many people of you I met apostle Catherine King on
 YouTube. Yeah, at the time I struggled with depression and anxiety and suicidal thoughts.
 I didn't want to leave. I thought it's better if I never like was born. So I had a lot of fears and
 nightmares and like I couldn't sleep and guilt and religion spirit everything. So and I when I found
 you, you're my spiritual mama now and my husband's too. We saw honor you apostle Catherine.
 And so I showed my husband and he was so skeptical in the beginning. So but and
 as it's a lady, you know, like religion spares like yeah she couldn't be a apostle. And so but
 then he saw the change in me because it's my life start changing like layer by layers. So and after
 that he I accepted I saw changes and I couldn't resist. And thank you Jesus. Yeah. And after more
 and more watching equipping and I was delivered from from the from from pornography addiction,
 from probation addiction and from the spirit of religion from I was healed from arthritis.
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And we were healed from arthritis in your hands. Praise God. Yes.
 Yeah. And that keeps showing us more and more and we pray for each other. And this happened all as
 you're watching online. All those miracles. Wow. People watching online. Get ready.
 And we started translating your videos into Russian and testimonies. We have a channel now
 for that. Yes. We have more more like 550 followers and people so hungry in Russia
 and surrounding countries. They were actually waiting for you to come to Russia.
 At some point it would be it would be a blessing for many many people. Amen. Yes. May the doors open
 and pray for us because we want to bring anointing to Russia. Amen. Yes. Yes. I will. Praise God.
 And did you have anything else you wanted to share of your testimony of what happened as you
 watched online. Now I don't have any. He saw changes. Was it in her. So you saw changes in her
 and that's how you couldn't deny. Yes. I couldn't deny. And then what were the changes in her.
 She she had this burst of anger sometimes and now she's so so calm. Our relationship changed.
 We have best relationship in decades. Yes. We have nothing to hide from each other.
 It's all very transparent like very like unique relationship I would say.
 Praise God. Praise God. Yeah. I don't have any depression any like suicidal thoughts. I sleep well.
 Yeah. So you used to struggle with all those things and then watching online God touched you
 and delivered you from all of that through the screen. Praise God. We've been believers for many
 years but still experience all these things like addictions and like depression all these things.
 But after we started watching like anointing Jesus anointing through you and really change our life.
 Glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
 Jesus. Hallelujah.
 Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Do you live in Russia now? You live in Russia. Wow. So you
 traveled here to be to be here. Wow. Oh my goodness. Praise God. I just I see this the
 light of Jesus shining through you so powerfully into the the country of Russia. Oh thank you Jesus.
 Hallelujah. The light has come. There's many people living in darkness in Russia and the light has
 dawned through you. Jesus is shining through you. Jesus is going to shine so powerfully through you.
 And a big reason that God led you to come here right now is that it's the year of acceptance
 and the the ground has been prepared in Russia and he brought you here to receive impartation
 of anointing that when you go there so many will be attracted to your light to Jesus in you
 and their eyes will open and they will be hungry and they will start seeking God more and they will
 find him. They will find him in his fullness through you. It's time for revival in Russia
 in Jesus name. Let revival come in Russia in Jesus name. I release this anointing upon you. May the
 power of God and the light of Jesus move through you and touch many people in Russia in Jesus name.
 I release this anointing to you. Let this power of God move through you mightily. May many people,
 may many men, men, may many men see the light, see the truth through you in Jesus name. Hallelujah.

 Christian nations, the ones that are seen as more Christian and open. This revival God wants,
 God plans to bring this revival to every single nation and it's happening now. Thank you Jesus.
 Revival is now for the whole world. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
 Glory to God. Glory to God. Glory to God. Look how powerful your light shines
 just by receiving freedom.
 Like, like his eyes open up just by the example, just by, you know, I always share this. It's very
 important you're where the power of God is so you can be delivered and transformed because that's
 how you're the brightest light. That's how the most amount of people will come to Jesus.
 That's so powerful. Praise God. Praise God. You are, you are such a light to your whole family.
 Even if they never say anything, they see a difference and it's planted seeds. It for sure
 is planted seeds already. Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Praise God.
 Do we also have a visitor from the Netherlands here? Hi. Hi. I hear that Janet has a testimony
 Janet, you want to come?
 Hallelujah. Welcome. Come on. Hallelujah. So you're all from the Netherlands? Welcome.
 Amazing. And I hear you have a testimony to share.
 Yes. First of all, I want to tell you that we honor you and that we have make a covenant with
 you to stay with you for all our lives. And yeah, that we honor you that you
 teaches us the principles of the kingdom. That is not just a fairy tale, but that is really
 the principles of the kingdom and they're really powerful principles. So yeah,
 I want to honor you for this. And yeah, we have, we are still in awe because this amazing thing
 happened last week we were here. And like every week you are praying over all the seeds
 that people put in the kingdom, put in 5F church and every week you are doing this. You say,
 okay, miracles, let it increase and all these things. So we came here with our sister, Natalie
 also, and she's also from our group, but you, the principles of what you told became true in our
 lives. Because we went on a tour just last week we were here. We went on a tour to the United
 States. We go to the Grand Canyon to Vegas and we were there. Then God told me to honor my husband
 and buy him a really big present. But my credit card was blocked so I could not pay for the present
 that I want to buy him because the money was on the account, but it was not on the card. So
 and we were in Vegas, there was no Wi-Fi. So we have to walk for a few miles to a hotel to have
 a new Wi-Fi. And so that I can transfer the money to his credit card so I can buy it for him. But
 then we were at the hotel and I praised God because I want to honor him that he is a good heart. He is
 loved by God, you know. And then we were at the hotel, we sit drinking and toasting about
 God wants to do this for him. And then I put my card because this the morning that morning I checked
 my card and it could not work still. So this morning was not working. And then we have Wi-Fi.
 So I look at my credit account and God put 90,000 euros on my account.
 Wow, like this. And there was not a single, how do you say it, description. You know,
 you see it like, it went up. It went up. So it went up. Yeah. And this is, this is God's present
 for him. He wants also to honor him. But not only that, we came with a picture last Sunday also.
 And this is our sister in Christ. And she has, how do you call it, like a lack, lack, and like a spirit
 of poverty. And so God gave this big amount of money so that she will be released because
 you prayed for everybody, not especially for Natalie, but she was delivered, you know. And
 then now God gave this money so she's free from poverty. She has this, all this money. We can give
 it to her now also. So that's two miracles. One to bless his heart, you know, and the other one is to
 bless her heart. So I want to testify also that you say we are the ex-church, the ex-church. We are
 like miracles and all these great things. But also we are one in the spirit. And so if one of us
 sow into the kingdom, then God can release also miracles for other brothers and sisters
 who needed it. And then she knows, now she can know that God loves her so much that he delivered
 her because she's really close to God and also very blessing to us. So yeah, I want, yeah,
 the power of sowing, but all the principles you tell us. And I want to tell you, yeah, we song,
 we can move mountains, you know, but this is really, we can move mountains. I'm sowing because
 she cannot imagine this, you know, but it's totally out of the box with God. And yeah, that's really,
 really wow, we're in awe together. Praise God. What you sow, you reap. So when you give something,
 it feels like you're losing it. You're like, okay, it's gone now, but then God gives it back and
 gives back more because you've sowed. It's the way of increase supernaturally. Wow. For all the people
 of five ever around the world, for everyone, you know, believe because he can do it also for all of
 you. So yeah, he's so great. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
 I want to speak over all of you in the Netherlands. You have such precious hearts, all of you,
 such pure precious hearts that have really carried, grabbed a hold of this new wine
 that God has released. And that's whom God can use. Those who will empty themselves out completely
 to receive purely the new wine. And I see him using you powerfully in the Netherlands,
 powerfully. I see him using you just releasing this light, this anointing. Thank you, Jesus.
 Praise God. I release this anointing upon you. May the power of God increase in your life and move
 through you mightily as you speak about Jesus and his new wine. May many eyes open up and I declare
 you to increase and increase that as you sow, you would continue to increase and increase and
 increase and increase and increase that you would be so blessed and have abundance, abundance in your
 finances and abundance in every area in Jesus name. Thank you, Father. I release this anointing to you
 now. May this anointing increase and may many people be attracted to the light of Jesus in you.
 May many men come and see what God is doing. May they see your light and come to him. Receive this
 anointing now. May the power of God move through you and touch many people. Let miracles take place
 through you and may eyes open up to the love of Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Praise God. Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah. Revival is now in the Netherlands. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah. Jesus. It's really revival. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Glory to God.
 Glory to God. Wow. Wow, Jesus. Well, I want to welcome everybody watching online.
 Welcome to all of our 5F Church family. Welcome to everyone tuning in for the first time or
 if you're just tuning in right now because you're curious or you need a miracle, whatever you're
 doing, whatever reason that you are here, welcome. And myself and we all are so excited for what God's
 going to do in your life today because as you've heard these miracles that God has done through the
 screen, God can do any miracle. He can deliver you from addictions. He can deliver you from depression.
 He can heal you from arthritis and actually anything he can do through the screen today.
 He's going to do many miracles through the screen today. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
 So get ready, get expectant, and make sure you're sharing this live stream as much as you can with
 all of your family, your friends, everywhere on every social media platform. Be the light and
 share this good news. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
 All right. Well, we have, I have a very exciting announcement today.
 Small groups, 5F Church small groups around the U.S. and around the whole world have started,
 some of them have started today. Hallelujah. Some of them are going to begin this coming week,
 others will begin later. And I believe we have 36 groups that are starting about this week
 around the world. Praise God. And so we have a map I want to show you of all the places.
 This is where all the small groups are meeting this week. Most of them this week are starting,
 some of them today. Isn't this incredible? This is so amazing. Thank you, Jesus.
 So there's small groups beginning. If you live in any of these states, cities, or nations,
 you can sign up for these small groups at 5Fchurch.org slash small groups.
 So I'm going to start reading these right now. These are the small groups that are beginning
 this week. Georgia, Savannah, Georgia specifically as well, but all of Georgia too. New Jersey,
 Florida, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Northern California, Pennsylvania, San Antonio,
 Texas, San Diego also. And all of Texas, Austria, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway,
 the Philippines, South Korea, Canada, Chile, Fiji, France, Ireland, South Africa, Sweden,
 Poland, Croatia, the UK, New England, Illinois, Uruguay, Finland, Switzerland,
 South Carolina, and Mexico. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus,
 for spreading your revival all over the US and all over the world through these groups,
 the fire will spread. And it's going to be an opportunity for those having these groups.
 It's going to be such an amazing opportunity to bring in the harvest, to invite people,
 to invite people to come to the small groups in every area of your life, to invite them.
 And I know Jesus is going to be catching many fish through this, through this new way to reach
 people. You know, not only just tuning in online to share with people to tune online, but to be
 able to invite someone to come in the home, come and gather together. I cannot wait for what God
 is about to do through this. I'm so expectant for many testimonies. Hallelujah. And we're going to
 be having more small groups as time goes on. So those of you watching online, if you didn't hear
 your state or your nation, just have patience because in time it is coming. Keep praying for
 revival to spread in your nation and your state. It is coming. Hallelujah. And the purpose of these
 small groups is for those who do not live in the Southern California area near LA that cannot come
 in person, for them to be able to fellowship and gather together and experience service together.
 There's many people, actually some of these small groups are happening right now. Hello, everyone.
 Right now, I know there's some in Florida happening right now, for example, but we have some small
 groups happening right now where they're watching together in their homes this service. So they're,
 yeah. So they're, and some are gathering virtually and gathering after the service
 to share testimonies and fellowship. So this is amazing that really church is happening, not here
 in LA and not just individually in homes, but they're gathering together groups all over.
 Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Thank you, Jesus. So once again, go to 5fchurch.org slash
 small groups. And if you see your state or your nation there, you can submit a form,
 the form, and then the leader from that group will get back to you. So it's just, they're all
 different. So just wait to hear back with the plan. Some may be starting a little bit later,
 but that's how you can get started. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
 And I'm so proud of all of the small group leaders that are taking on this role of leadership and
 taking on this responsibility. I'm so proud of you all and I'm so grateful for what God has done in
 your hearts, what God has done in your lives so that he can use you in this way of leadership.
 Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. All right. So now I'm gonna, I'm gonna show a testimony.
 We're gonna watch a video right now so we can take the table away. We're gonna watch a video right now
 of a powerful testimony speaking of revival spreading all over the world.
 This is such a powerful testimony of a family who are all planted, who have all become planted at
 5Fchurch all the way from Germany. And it is so powerful. So we're gonna watch it right now.
 Revival is now.
 Revival is now.
 Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah. Glory to God. Revival is now.
 Hallelujah. Wow, Jesus. Revival is now for the whole world, every nation,
 every tongue, every language, for every language, for every different speaking language
 that a person speaks. This revival is for every age, every age, babies to the elderly, everybody
 in between. And it's spreading now. It's reaching the places it wouldn't reach before. It hadn't
 reached before. It's happening now. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Glory to God.
 Anyone blessed by that testimony? I was so blessed by that testimony. I want to thank that whole
 family for sharing your testimony. You've blessed so many people and I know many eyes will open up
 through your testimony. And I bless this family, this family, Katia's family, may you increase,
 may this anointing increase in your lives in Jesus' name. This is a power of your testimony.
 If any of you felt blessed by that testimony, this, you need to know that your testimony carries the
 same power. It carries the same power. If Jesus has truly done something in your life, it carries
 the same power, the same power to open up eyes, to bring faith, to prophesy miracles,
 to bless people's hearts. Amen. Hallelujah. I'm going to be teaching today,
 the, I title this message, Running With the Revival Torch.
 Praise God. Hallelujah. Luke 4, 18 through 19, the spirit of the, this is the scripture of the year,
 the word of the year for 2025 is that it's the year of acceptance. It's the year of the Lord's
 acceptance. And so this is the, Luke 4, 18, 19, the spirit of the Lord is upon me. The spirit of the
 Lord is upon all of us because he has anointed me. He has anointed us to preach the gospel to the
 poor. He has sent me us to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery
 of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year
 of the Lord, to proclaim hallelujah. Hallelujah. So God does something different every year. And in
 this year, he is moving so powerfully to bring acceptance of him, acceptance of his revival.
 He is pursuing people in an even more powerful way. And there's many people he has been pursuing
 for a long time. And now the harvest is ripe in their hearts to receive him that will lead to
 acceptance of him. It's the year of the Lord's acceptance for his revival, for his move,
 because you cannot separate Jesus from his revival and his move. Because Jesus, Jesus's biggest
 passion and the biggest thing that he does and the biggest part of his heart is to reveal his
 love to his people and to save the lost and heal the sick and free the oppressed and equip his
 people. And he does it through his vessels. He does it through the church, Ephesians 4 through
 11 through 16, where it talks about the five-fold ministry that equips the body. He does it through
 his church. He does it through ministries. And so revival comes through ministries, through churches.
 And we as a body are a part of these ministries. We are as a body are a part of this church.
 So revival is here in this church and we are called to go and spread this revival out in the world
 and bring them into the church as well so that the revival can increase. Because the more that
 the church increases, the more that the light increases, the more that people are equipped
 and receive impartation and receive deliverance to shine so bright for that to just be a great
 testimony in itself as we heard in the testimony earlier. The more the more believers in the body
 of Christ will shine so bright when they're receiving what they need to shine bright in the
 church, in the church where God is calling them to be planted, which will be where his power is.
 Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So this is what God is doing this year. He is
 doing things supernaturally. He has been doing things supernaturally in the spiritual realm,
 preparing hearts, pursuing people in preparation for this year of acceptance. Just like Jesus was
 raised by Mary and Joseph. He was taken care of. He was raised up by the Lord.
 And it was finally time, age 30, for the acceptable year of the Lord when he speaks this verse.
 It was a specific time. It was a specific year for the harvest to come in and for people to
 accept Jesus. And so in this year, it's time for people to accept Jesus like never before.
 It's time for people to accept Jesus and his fullness, his power, his anointing, his freedom
 and healing, the new wine, the new wine principles. It's time for people to receive these, accept
 these, come into the new wine, come into the revival like never before on a greater scale
 than ever before. Hallelujah. And I love how prophetic this is here even today hearing the
 testimonies. This might have been the first testimony I think from people from Russia
 sharing how revival has come in their life. Hallelujah. And I think this might have been
 the first testimony we have seen, the one that we just played, of an entire family,
 or most of a family at least, and even the elderly, all testifying of fully entering into revival.
 Not just receiving a little bit, not just tiptoeing to the revival, but stepping fully in,
 planting themselves in the revival. Hallelujah. Like these testimonies, even this day, is so
 prophetic for this message because what we are seeing in this year is people accepting the Lord
 like never before. People from different nations that we wouldn't hear accept the Lord like never
 before. Different age groups, you know, hallelujah. This is what God is doing now. And it is the
 greatest time to be alive. It is the greatest year of our lives, I believe with all my heart.
 Hallelujah.
 Matthew 9.35. Jesus traveled throughout all the towns and villages of that area,
 teaching in the synagogues and announcing the good news about the kingdom. And he healed every kind
 of disease and illness. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were confused
 and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. He said to his disciples, the harvest is great,
 but the workers are few. So pray to the Lord who is in charge of the harvest. Ask him to send more
 workers into his fields. So Jesus, in this acceptable year of the Lord, he's going and
 ministering and he's seeing the crowds, a mass amount of people, and he's having great compassion
 on them because he saw in the spiritual realm they were confused and helpless,
 like sheep without a shepherd. And so he saw there is such a great harvest that's ready to be
 gathered. There are so many people in desperate need for Jesus. And they're ready, they're open.
 It's not like before where they were so opposed. Because, and a lot of these people, they're getting
 to the rock bottom place where finally they're ready to seek God because they're desperate.
 A lot of that is happening this year too. But back in this time that Jesus is speaking this,
 he's seeing there's so many that are ready to be brought into the harvest. There's so many,
 there's actually so many that there's not an even ratio to the workers, to the workers that need to
 bring in the harvest, to the ones that need to shine their light and bring them in. There's not
 an even ratio of them to those that are ready to be brought in, to the, brought in and gathered.
 And so this is what's happening right now. And we're seeing these parallels because it was the
 acceptable year of the Lord back then. And it's the acceptable year of the Lord this year. Hallelujah.
 But we're seeing the same thing is happening right now. Right now the harvest is so big
 and the workers are few compared to the harvest. The workers are many of you. The workers are the
 true disciples of Jesus who have decided to surrender everything and follow Jesus to pick up
 their cross, surrendering every part, no more lukewarmness, but they have surrendered everything.
 And because they've surrendered everything, God could then transform them more into his image.
 And now he can put impartation in them. And because they have surrendered, now their eyes
 can open up and see fully the new wine and receive fully the new wine.
 So that it's not like the Pharisees, you know, trying to do things that Jesus way and mixing
 that can't work. But because they've surrendered everything, they are able to receive purely the
 new wine and receive impartation of anointing. They can be trusted with that. And now they are
 ready to be workers. They are ready to shine their light so bright and bring people into the harvest
 to be real disciples of Jesus. Amen. The more we are surrendered, the more God can transform us
 and put anointing in us. And in that case, that's how our light shines the brightest. That's how we
 are ready to bring in the harvest. That's how the harvest will come. That's how when we put the
 net out, fish will come. Amen. And so this is happening right now. There are workers,
 but there are few. Even there are people planted from 158 nations. Speaking of that, I want to
 welcome everyone who became planted this past week. We can put the graphic up. Many people
 became planted this week from around the world. Glory to God. From all these places. Hallelujah.
 We welcome 122 new 5F Church family. Welcome. We're so blessed to have you part of our family
 and excited for your future of abundant life and to be used powerfully by God and walk in your
 purpose. Hallelujah. So we have people planted from 158 nations, but we have a strong, amazing
 beginning of 36 groups. And that's not, I think it's maybe like half of that are nations.
 So, you know, there's a need and a hunger for many more small groups, for example. That's just an
 example. But I praise God. It's a big, great start. Amen. But that's just an example I give to you
 that the harvest is so big. It is so great. And the workers are few compared to the harvest
 that is out there. And what this means for us is that we need to be aware of that and make sure
 we are running and not walking. Make sure we are not walking with our torch, but running because
 there's so much work to be done. If it was an even ratio of the harvest and the workers,
 you could walk maybe. You wouldn't have as much work. But there is a big work to be done.
 So we have to run. This is what God is calling us now to do.
 To make up for the lack of workers compared to the harvest that is out there. Hallelujah.
 Amen. So it's how you run. You need to first understand that the harvest is ripe now.
 You need to hear this prophetic word of God that Jesus is speaking again now. The harvest is ripe,
 but the workers are few. You need to let this word put a fire in you to want to make sure that you're
 doing your part, that you're not slacking in your role as a worker, as a laborer to bring in the
 harvest, and that you're going above and beyond. Because if we will all run instead of walk and go
 above and beyond, there won't be people that are left. The harvest can all be brought in. Hallelujah.
 God will move us through us supernaturally. But there is something God is speaking prophetically
 that we have a responsibility to work hard for Jesus in this season like never before because
 of prophetically how God has prepared this harvest to be brought in. So you need to first be aware of
 this and know, like, look out in the world, look out in your workplace, look in your family, like
 see them, see them differently, see everyone that you come in contact with with different eyes
 knowing that God has been pursuing them and many of them, they are ripe. They are ripe to come into
 the kingdom. You need to believe this prophetic word and see them differently because maybe you
 invited them to church before, you talked about Jesus with them before, and they were very rejecting
 of what you had to say. They didn't want to hear it. They didn't show interest. Maybe they
 made you feel bad. But things have changed. I'm telling you. I've seen this in my own personal
 life, in my own family. I've seen this radical shift where the only thing that explains it is
 God has been doing things. God has been showing up to people. God has been giving signs. God has been
 speaking to them. God has been moving behind the scenes where we don't know what he's, but I mean,
 that's all I can say. Even things that I've seen in my own family, all I can say is God has been
 moving. God has been pursuing like never before this year. So you need to start afresh. I remember
 when Peter, they were casting their nets out and they weren't getting any fish.
 So they're ready to call the quits. They tried, they tried, they tried, they failed, they failed,
 they failed. But then Jesus says, no, go deeper. Walk, don't run.
 And try casting your next nets out now when I speak and see what happens.
 Luke 5, 5, Master, Simon replied. We worked hard all last night and didn't catch a thing.
 But if you say so, so this is after Jesus says, go into deeper waters and cast the nets out again. So
 Simon's like, we worked hard all last night. We didn't catch a thing. But if you say so,
 like this doesn't make logical sense, but I choose to believe Lord what you are saying instead of
 logic and my feelings. But if you say so, I'll let the nets down again. And this time their nets were
 so full of fish, they began to tear even. A shout for help brought their partners and the other boat
 and soon both boats were filled with fish and on the verge of sinking. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah. And so some of you have been casting your nets out and you were supposed to be doing
 that. It's not like you weren't supposed to be doing it. It was out of obedience and you were
 catching one sometimes, two, little bit. A big thing you were doing was planting seeds,
 but not actually bringing in the fish yet. So you were doing a great work, but you need to know now
 it's the prophetic season of harvest, of catching the fish. And so now you need to go deeper
 and cast out your nets. Hear this prophetic word of God. And the thing is, is that Jesus, when he
 says cast the nets there, you know, this prophetic act that he was showing them, it was fully, it was
 so supernatural. I mean, the anointing from Jesus was calling the fish. It wasn't just, it wasn't
 just, oh, he has ISSC that a bunch of fish are just flocked in that area. So he says,
 his anointing drew them. It was time for them to be gathered. So he himself with his anointing
 released it and they were, they were gravitated to come where the net was. Hallelujah. And so this is
 what God is doing right now in this season, in this year. He is calling the fish. He's been pursuing
 the fish. The anointing has been moving and touching them in different ways. And the, the, the,
 like you're like the net and the net is anointed. He is poured out more anointing upon you like never
 before. And when you put that net out, people will be drawn to you. People will be drawn to,
 to talk with you, to hear more, to, to take your advice when you say, watch this video,
 read this book, unlock your deliverance, come to church with me, watch this live stream.
 They like fish will be drawn to the anointing in your net, the net of your voice, the net of your
 smile, the net of your eyes that have Jesus in them, the net of your heart showing love
 through your actions, through your words. And you are going to be shocked at the ease that this,
 that this comes. You know, usually when they were fishing before, they were either catching nothing
 or if they had a good day, they would catch some, but never like this, never in where the
 net was tearing, the multiple boats were overflowing. And so before maybe people so much
 thought you were weird when you would talk about Jesus before they really didn't care to hear what
 you had to say. You found so much rejection, but things have changed now because of what God has
 been doing in their hearts. Number one and number two, the way he has put this anointing in you
 in this year through at the, at the, the impartation that happened at a rise and shine,
 this is all prophetic. It was prophetic. That conference for this season that we are in now,
 you are carrying now powerful anointing more than ever. Those of you that have been here for years,
 you are carrying more than ever and people will be drawn to you. They will be drawn.
 They will be drawn. Hallelujah. Praise God.
 And, and, and, and, and the Lord gave me this scripture this morning as I was meditating,
 the scripture that I shared about the catching the fish. And as soon as I thought about it,
 I started laughing because I remember Diane's testimony from, I think like yesterday that she
 shared online where she was going fishing and she actually caught more fish than I ever saw anyone
 catch. It was huge. It was really fast that you, you were the only one, no one else was able to
 catch fish and you caught fish. Wait, come here and just share that real quick. That,
 this was like literally a prophetic example. I didn't even know this. This is wow. Just share
 what you just said right now. Well, I think that we're all anointed here. So anything that we do
 is all of in abundant. I don't know if you guys are aware of that, but yeah, yesterday we went
 fishing. Like it was quite a hike to get there. My favorite spot. I'm not telling you where it's at.
 Okay. You're not going to get it from me. So we were like catching like, we couldn't even keep up
 with the fish. Okay. You guys saw Aiden was just cat reeling in every little fish, but I told the
 kids, I'm like, count the fish. We're only allowed to have five each. And they keep on telling, oh
 yeah, we're, we've got 13. I'm like, I'm pretty sure we're at 20 now and we're going to get like
 ticket and penalty and all of that stuff. And then the kids are like, can we catch for the other
 people? Cause they're not catching anything. And I was like, well, we cannot do that. That's illegal.
 But, and then I left the book. You saw that unlike the deliverance book on the tree. And then,
 and then I said to catch a fish, to catch a lot of fish, do this. So I gave them my secret. I'm
 not telling you guys, sorry. So I wrote it and then this book changed my life. Right. And
 I didn't realize the, the next door, um, Fisher people, um, she's got four kids and you saw what
 she said. Some people didn't see it. So share, share. So, um, this is wild. Okay. It is the year
 of acceptance really. So the one I posted on Facebook and one lady said, Hey, I think this
 woman was the one who left the book. And I'm like, okay, this is weird. And then the woman,
 she somehow found you, found me, right? Cause this is a very secret place. You will not know this
 place. Nobody knows this place because there's so much fish in there. So, and then the woman that
 got the book said, Oh yeah, that is the lady that left the book. And she was like, this book,
 I really needed this book. And she was like crying and I guess reading it on her, on her way home.
 And this person has four little kids. I mean, if you have four little kids, you need this book.
 I'm sorry, but you need this book. You need extra dose of anointing, extra dose of God's power to
 take care of little ones. I have three boys and oh my goodness gracious. So just fully blessed,
 you know, the abundance that we have through the anointing, it's just crazy good. I cannot even like,
 I had a hard time lifting the fish. I like the two boys. I'm like, I cannot lift this fish. There's
 too much the whole time. I couldn't lift the fish. They're too much. Glory to God. Thank you.
 Glory to God. So I saw her testimony and I was in awe. You see, so someone, I guess the woman who
 found the book, who grabbed the book, who started reading it, told like a friend or something. And
 so the friend happened to somehow find your post. Because you don't know each other. The friend that
 found, you don't know either of them. So in the massive world of Facebook, this somehow happened.
 Jesus is how it happened. But I really believe that Jesus made this, I don't know the chances
 of that happening when you don't know each other on Facebook. You know what I mean? The tiniest
 chance of this happening. I really believe Jesus made that happen to teach you all.
 To encourage you, Diane, and to encourage everybody
 that what you're doing in sharing the book and what you're doing in sharing about revival
 is so powerful. Like that God is moving upon it 100%. He is moving upon it. And a lot, I mean,
 it was a huge miracle that this woman found you so you could even know that somebody picked up the
 book, let alone was crying, desperately needed it. I saw a message she wrote, she found you on
 TikTok or something. And she said, you don't know how much I needed this. I was tearing up reading it.
 But I mean, there's so many times that you have left the book somewhere, you have told somebody
 watch this video, or you have shared on your social media, but nobody's commented, nobody's
 liked it, nobody came back to tell you, nobody could find, nobody knew who left the book to be
 able to reach out to you. This has already happened so much. This testimony that we just heard,
 we just heard, where someone actually received your word, received the book, watched the video,
 and they desperately needed it, and Jesus moved so powerfully and touched them and healed them
 and delivered them, and they became saved and delivered. This has already happened so many times.
 But this is a great miracle that God made this to happen to open up all of your eyes
 to see what he's doing in this year of acceptance. God is doing this every year,
 but it's with great acceleration this year. But you could be thinking it's on a tree,
 you leave it in a remote place, very remote place, you're like in the woods.
 You could think, and immediately someone grabbed it and was crying and God touches them.
 Praise God. So this is what's happening now. As you cast your nets out, so many fish are coming
 supernaturally because of what God is doing this year and because of the anointing that is in you.
 God is drawing people to you, to the words you're speaking, to the posts you're posting,
 to the books you're leaving and handing to people. Holla at them!
 Hallelujah! Praise God!
 I also, there's another one of my spiritual daughters, she shared this testimony with me.
 She said that she shared, she was just sharing about my new book, Unlock Your Deliverance.
 She was sharing about it on her social media. I think she was sharing about just how she was
 going to be mailing it some places. And she said that someone that she had known for years and
 years ago randomly reached out saying, I want this book. And so she then invited her to come
 to a Rise and Shine conference and she came. And my spiritual daughter, she told me, she said,
 there's actually a picture of her. And I saw the picture and she's in the very front and her,
 the look on her face is full of so much joy. So do you know how like a picture says a thousand words?
 It was like you could cry to see the picture. I mean, you could cry to see what God was doing
 in her, the joy he had brought her. It was like,
 it was like that. Like when you're so full of joy, you can't do a closed mouth smile.
 You know, the smile can't be contained. You know? Hallelujah! But I was just like, wow,
 thank God she shared that post. Thank God she shared that book.
 And this is so easy to do. This is so simple. This is as simple as plop the net into the water,
 plop, overflowing immediately. Hallelujah! Something different is happening this year,
 something different. God is drawing his people. I went to a salon, I was at a salon yesterday,
 and the person helping me has helped me for a long time now there. And
 I've played videos of me before sometimes, like just like approving what the editor's
 work's doing before we post them on social media. So I'm like looking at the videos. Sometimes I have
 the music up a little, or the volume up a little bit. My headphones weren't working.
 This was two days ago, or Friday. My headphones weren't working. So I had to have the volume on,
 but I had it very low, just like not to disturb, you know, people in the public place. And I'm
 watching the impartation session of Horizon Shine to try to approve the editing. And I have it on
 double speed to be able to go through it. So I'm talking like this. You can't hardly understand
 what I'm saying. You can't hardly understand what I'm saying, I don't think. And it's very quiet on
 top of that. It's not just like this. And the person that was like working, helping me,
 just I sat out of nowhere. It's like not you talking, it's Jesus speaking.
 Just just said it out of nowhere. Just said it out of nowhere. And I was so shocked. I said,
 yes, yes, you're right. And I was just shocked because this just can't, it wasn't my first time
 there. Many times been there. And the volume was low and it was on doubles the speed.
 So I don't know if he could even understand, you know. And then after that, he was like,
 can you tell me the title of that? Like went out of his way to ask the title of it so he could watch
 it. And I was just in awe. I mean, this is the anointing. And I mean, I shared this story with
 you because this kind of thing, like that kind of story does not happen to me. Because maybe you
 think, oh, that's that happens all the time, like in public. No, it doesn't. God was showing me,
 this is how powerfully I am moving now. I am drawing them. I'm drawing people.
 I'm opening their eyes to see the anointing, to get them to sense the anointing
 where they did it before. Hallelujah.
 Hebrews 12.1. Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a loud, such a huge crowd of witnesses
 to the life of faith, let us strip off every weight that slows us down, especially the sin
 that so easily trips us up. And let us run with endure, let us run. Notice it doesn't say walk.
 It doesn't say speed walk. Let us run with endurance.
 With it, we got to keep running. Children of God, warriors of God, we got to keep on running.
 With endurance, the race God has set before us. We do this by keeping our eyes on Jesus,
 the champion who initiates and perfects our faith because of the joy awaiting him. He endured the
 cross, disregarding his shame. We're going to go to, I'm going to, I want to read this also in the
 passion translation. As for us, we have all of these great witnesses who encircle us like clouds,
 who are cheering us on, who are seeing us and see the great work we are doing and cheering us on.
 So we must let go of every wound that has pierced us and the sin we so easily fall into.
 Then we will be able to run life's marathon race with passion and determination
 for the path has been already marked out before us. Hallelujah.
 So first, you need to strip off every weight that is holding you back because you got to be able to
 run with that torch. We got to run to make up for the lack of workers compared to the harvest.
 So that means we have to be ready every day to shine our lights, to be Christ-like. We have to
 be ready every day to go on the mission field and do the assignment that God has instructed us to
 do. Looking for any opportunity to tell people about Jesus, to shine our light, to tell our
 testimony, to share the book, unlock your deliverance with people, whatever it is, we need to be looking
 every day for these opportunities. We need to be ready to cast that net out everywhere we go
 because fish are waiting to be caught. So that we got to do this with zeal, we got to be ready to
 with vigor, with passion, with determination, with boldness. And so that means we can't have
 things holding us back. You need to remember now that you are not living how you used to live.
 Focus on getting delivered, your spiritual growth only, just coming to church just to receive,
 and that's it. Just to receive and get out of a place of deficit. But now God has delivered you,
 many of you, many of you, God has delivered you already. He has fed you a lot of spiritual food
 and has transformed you. You are no longer a baby anymore. And now it's time to work, to bring in
 the harvest. It's not time to be a fish that's caught again and again. You've been caught.
 Now you need to catch the fish. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank
 you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So you need to constantly renew your mind that it's
 time to no longer be a baby and I got to go out and work for Jesus now. I got to run.
 And so any lie of the devil that's trying to say you're not good enough,
 you failed in this area, you don't have what it takes,
 whatever the lie is, you got to grow up and reject those lies once and for all and choose to never
 give in to them again because the devil's trying to slow you down. The devil's trying to put weights
 on you to slow you down. Return to the message I preached last Sunday where I taught on when a
 righteous man falls down seven times, he will rise again. You got to return. If any of you struggle
 with that, you got to return to that message because it's time to keep on rising and working
 for Jesus and running with your torch. That's the place you are at now in life. That is your
 assignment now. That is where you are. Hallelujah. You're good enough. You are more than good enough.
 You are chosen by God. Anything different that comes in your mind is a lie from the devil.
 Yes. Hallelujah. The harvest is ripe and the workers are few.
 Don't let the workers be even less because you listen to the devil.
 Remember who you are. Remember what God has spoken to you. Remember what God has revealed to you.
 You are perfectly made. You are chosen. You have everything you need. You don't need to be perfect
 right now. You're still growing. If you make a mistake sometimes, that's okay. Don't let any of
 these lies of the devil disqualify you and make yourself to sit down or slow down. You got to keep
 running because God's counting on you. He's counting on you to be fishers of men and continually
 cast your nets out because the harvest is so ripe. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah. We're all a bunch of average Joe people. We're not perfect angels, robots. We're
 all a bunch of average Joe people. This is whom God chooses. He uses the foolish things of the
 world to confound the wisdom of the world. So anytime the devil tries to say you, you're not
 good enough, you say, I am good enough. I'm a foolish thing. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
 Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And now, like for me, for me to preach, for me to lead people,
 for me to speak in front of people used to be my weakness. It used to be my weakness.
 I was a weak and foolish thing because the area that God was calling me to, for him to use me the
 most was what I considered my biggest weakness. And it was the last thing I wanted to do was get
 up in front of people and preach. I shouldn't say last thing, but like, I mean, it was so uncomfortable
 for me to do that. I felt so inadequate. And it was even for years that I would hear the devil lying
 to me. It was several, it was years. It was from the beginning, 2017 to 2021 that I would hear the
 devil say, you're not a good enough preacher. People aren't blessed. People aren't coming back.
 You don't have what it takes. But I knew God was calling me to run every day and keep proclaiming
 revival is now and keep preaching what he led me to preach no matter how I felt. And I kept doing
 that. And as I kept going, that weakness was turned into a strength by God's power.
 And so on my own, it's a weakness. But when we give ourselves to God, he moves in power to make it a strength.
 It doesn't, but your light is going to shine so bright and the harvest will come in, in your weaknesses.
 When I still felt so inadequate is when revival broke out.
 It wasn't that, okay, now I feel ready. Now I feel adequate. Now I feel like a good preacher or something.
 I'm good enough that then revival came. It came when I was still feeling inadequate because the devil was still speaking,
 but I kept rejecting him and kept obeying God. So this is what you have to do. Don't let those lies of the devil saying you're not good enough.
 Or maybe you made a mistake or something. So you're disqualified for today to be the light.
 Don't let those lies of the devil be a weight that drags you down. Hallelujah. Take off every weight.
 Reject every lie of the devil, every single one. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Any sin that you have in your life that you haven't
 surrendered to God yet, now is the time. Surrender it. Choose to stop sinning. Choose. It's a choice.
 Choose. Choose it. Choose rightly. The choice is yours. God will help you. He will help you overcome it.
 He will give you the strength and power if you will just choose. Another big lie of the enemy that you have to
 reject and never listen to again, to run this race with your torch, is the lies of religion.
 Because the lies of religion weigh you down and make you feel not good enough,
 make you feel like you're never matching up, and when you keep on living in the religious way,
 you keep on sinning and making mistakes. Because the grace of Jesus is not in religion.
 The grace of Jesus was not there in the old covenant and in the Pharisee ways.
 We needed Jesus' grace to destroy the curse of religion. But many people live religiously still,
 listening to the devil masquerading himself as an angel of light. If you did not hear this week's message on Wednesday,
 you need to watch it where so many people were delivered from the spirit of religion.
 The devil masquerading himself as an angel of light and leading people in religion and
 weighing them down and keeping them from shining. If you did not see that, watch that. And if you
 struggle with religion in the past, watch it again and again and again and again. Renew your mind.
 But you need to come completely in the new wine or you'll be bogged down with religion.
 And you will keep on sinning because it's only in the grace and not living religiously,
 but by God's grace and revelation of God's love, rather than the religious revelation that God,
 that it's impossible to be righteous before God, keeps you from knowing God's love.
 And the greatest way to have energy and joy and boldness, the only way, is to see God's love
 rightly to see how he sees you rightly. So this is crucial that you strip off the weights of religion
 because they are weighing you down. They are making you feel bad about yourself. They are making you
 not have a passion to serve God. They are keeping you in a cycle of sinning because there's no
 freedom in religion, only freedom in grace. The things that the religious spirit tells you to do,
 never, it's a cycle of sin, just like they were in a cycle of sin before Jesus came with his grace
 and new wine. Hallelujah. So get out of that cycle and step fully into the new wine. Listen,
 I have many teachings on freedom from religion, especially this past Wednesday. Listen again and
 again and again and again and again and again until you've emptied yourself out completely.
 That's a big way you empty yourself out of the old wine, is by intaking the new wine so God can open
 up your eyes and see, this is old wine in me. I don't want that anymore. That was wrong.
 That's how you, a big way you empty yourself out is by coming with an open childlike heart to receive
 the new wine teachings. That's how God opens up your eyes to see this is the right way.
 This is the Jesus way. This is the new wine that brings life that's full of grace and love
 and the anointing, the power to change. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah.
 So God is calling you now to be committed to keep your fire alive.
 See this task ahead of you that there's a great harvest to be brought in every day. I must keep my
 fire alive to do the assignment that God has called me to do. Don't just go about your days
 as you used to. Every day I have the most important job in the world to arise and shine,
 to tell people about Jesus, to testify, to share, unlock your deliverance. Every day I have the most
 important job in the world. So that means that it doesn't matter what your current job is. Maybe
 it's boring. Maybe it's not the job you want. Who cares? What God has called you to do is so
 much more important than that. And that's your real job that you can be doing while you're doing
 your job. God's put you in that place. He's put you in that workplace to do your real job,
 to shine your light. Because he knows that if there's darkness there and only you carry the
 anointing and the light, so that's why you're there for this season at least. So get excited to go to
 work. Get excited everywhere you go. When you're around people, get excited because you have the
 most important job in the world and you carry so much purpose. You will change lives forever.
 Hallelujah. Every day you really shine your light, you're changing lives forever.
 I wanted to share those testimonies with you, those few testimonies I shared earlier
 of the book in the woods and sharing the book on the Facebook, on social media. And it led to
 lives being changed forever. It was something so easy and so very quickly the harvest came in.
 Because God wants you to know how powerful he's using you, how you are changing lives forever
 by rising and shining every day, by truly running. And you can see me up here and think,
 you know, I'm changing lives, so many lives with the ministry, with the book I wrote, for example.
 But as I hear these stories, I'm like, it's like God was really opening my eyes up yesterday,
 even more. I was thinking about like the team, the basketball player who passes the basketball
 to the shooter, the talented shooter, the most talented shooter, and the shooter scores. But
 if the ball was not passed, if there wasn't a good enough, strong enough passer that was able to
 hone off the opponent and pass the ball, who cares what grade of a shooter the other guy is or girl?
 It doesn't matter. And as I hear these testimonies about the book being founded
 in the woods and everything, I'm like, I can write a book, but I can't get the book out to
 that person in the woods, to that person on your Facebook page. And so to me, like those people
 giving the book out and just sharing my messages, for example, to me, they're just as important.
 Their job is just as life-changing as my job. Like if I'm the shooter, they're the passer.
 So I feel this fire in my heart for you to understand what you carry, this anointing you
 carry. I feel this fire in my heart for you to understand how life-changing you are. You
 have already and will continue to change many lives and lead many people to be saved and to
 be delivered from demonic oppression. This is the power you have of this precious anointing. I know
 what I'm talking about. I saw my spiritual father walk in the power of God like I've never seen.
 And a couple years passed or no, no, no, years passed from 2016. I saw and I never seen God
 move like that. And I saw so many lives transformed and healed and delivered and saved. And I went to
 his church several times and I would see this and I would just be in awe. And I knew God was calling
 me to do the same, but it's just faith, not really like
 your feelings catching up yet, you know? And so then from 2016 to 2021,
 now all of a sudden that same anointing that moved through him was moving through me.
 And I saw many people begin to be delivered like I would see many people be delivered
 through him. And it was so shocking that same anointing in him was now in me.
 That same anointing that was moving through him, touching so many lives, changing so many lives
 in Africa was now moving through me, touching and changing so many lives in America and beyond.
 And so I know what I'm talking about. You are my spiritual children. The same thing happens. The
 same thing has happened. You are carrying the same exact anointing. You are world changers.
 You are so powerful in Christ. God wants you to have this great zeal where you can't walk. You're
 too excited. You're seeing spiritually what you carry and how you are a world changer and how when
 you run and not walk, but when you run, it leads to many lives changed, saved, healed and delivered.
 You can't help but run. Like how we've been so full of joy, we can't help but get on our feet
 and dance for Jesus. But let that also translate. Let it not only be praise and rejoicing in the
 church, let that also be your running the race with your torch up, shining your light to everybody
 in the world who needs it. Keep that fire that makes you not be able to sit still. Hallelujah.
 Praise God. In the past you have walked. In the past you have walked. You've shared about Jesus
 once in a while. You've testified about Jesus once in a while. You've shared on your social media
 once in a while. In the past you have walked. It's no longer time to walk. It is time to run now.
 Not just once in a while shining your light, testifying, sharing on social media in person
 all the time. This is what God's calling you to. Hallelujah.
 This is, and by doing this you're following your spiritual, the spiritual GPS from God
 because he's saying, the Lord gave me this revelation yesterday. It was like
 you're on the journey. You're following the GPS. GPS, we're all on that together
 because we're a part of this move of God. We're part of this revival. So it's the same GPS.
 And so now God is all, it's like maybe before you were in a town where the speed limit was
 35. And so now the GPS tells you to turn on the freeway. And now it's saying 65 miles per hour.
 What happens when you go 35 miles per hour on a highway that's 65 miles per hour?
 It's chaotic. People will honk. People will honk. People will honk. People will honk.
 You can cause accidents. So you know that you need to do what the speed limit says
 when you're on there. To have a peaceful ride, to have a safe ride, and to get there quicker
 to where you're going. Amen. This is how it is in the spiritual realm. This is where your grace is.
 Your grace isn't running in this season especially. Your grace, like this is the
 spiritual GPS now. God is saying, this is your assignment now, run for me.
 The harvest is ripe. The workers are few. I need you to go double time. I need you to run. I need
 you to see the preciouses that you carry and work hard for me.
 And that's where the grace is. When you're in God's will, that's where the grace is.
 And so that's where you'll find the greatest peace and joy and contentment. And that's where
 you will find the fulfillment that you were fulfilling your purpose. And that is where you
 will find protection from the enemy. And a big part of being able to live righteously and not be
 stuck in sin with the weights that hold you down is running fast with Jesus, is serving him.
 Because that's where grace is. That's one of the biggest ways that we keep doors shut to the devil,
 is by replacing sin, replacing downtime where the enemy can start to speak to you in your mind
 with working for Jesus, serving him. And then as you serve him, not only is there so much joy that
 you are pleasing God, because this is what he's asking you to do, and there's so much joy because
 you're simply in his will, but because you are serving him, there's so much joy in seeing
 the results, seeing the fish come out. There's so much joy in seeing lives change. There's so
 much joy in seeing people come in the kingdom, be delivered. There's not a joy like that.
 And that joy makes you fall more in love with God, which in turn helps you to be more spiritual
 and less fleshly. It's like a domino effect. You just simply follow God's GPS. You get on this
 highway, you run with Jesus, and God takes care of everything, and your life is so beautiful and
 full of so much joy. Hallelujah. Praise God. Something very important to do. First of all,
 I want to share this. Romans 10-13, for everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
 Listen to this. But how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him?
 And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him?
 And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them?
 Wow. How beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news.
 How beautiful, how bright you shine. How people are attracted to this beauty because you are
 being obedient to God to spread this good news. And as you do that, God continues to pour out more
 and more anointing. Your feet become more beautiful. All of you shines even brighter.
 And so you need to really get this in your head. The biggest way, and I mean of course,
 you need to really get this in your head. The biggest way, and according to the scripture,
 this is how, this is how people come to Jesus, is by hearing about him through other people.
 God needs you. God's counting on you. Those people out there in your life will not hear the good news
 without you. Some of them, some of them, because God's called you to those people specifically,
 and they won't hear unless you tell them. Hallelujah. So in running, this means hustling.
 To run for Jesus, this means to hustle. This means to be bold. This means to know the value
 of what you have and be the most amazing businessman or woman, salesman or woman for Jesus.
 I have something you need. Hear about it. Listen to me tell you about it. Come and receive.
 This will change your life forever. This is my testimony. I promise you this book will change
 your life, unlock your deliverance. I promise you as you read the Bible, God will speak to you.
 I promise you as you come to this church, the power of God will touch you. You'll be delivered.
 I promise you as you tune in live, the power of God will touch you and miracles will take place
 in your life. You need to have this boldness and passion for Jesus and hustle for Jesus.
 I want you to please not be casual and not say this is not my personality.
 I was thinking about this. A lot of people do not have the personality,
 I believe myself included because I've tried it in the past, to be like salespeople.
 I tried a couple different things. Didn't really work. I wasn't successful in it and it was like
 painful for me. Really draining, tiring. It felt like I was working so hard and nothing was happening.
 Like it was a waste, you know. And so a lot of people, like me, a lot of people, they see
 themselves as like maybe not a hustler, maybe not one that people will really listen to
 and take their advice or something. Or maybe you're not bold too. Maybe you don't see yourself as
 bold and that's painful or something. But we are all called to be salesmen and women for Jesus.
 To be about our Father's business. We are all called to have this hustler mentality.
 This is what I mean by running. Like this urgency. We must get more souls into the Kingdom.
 We must. We must increase. I must work hard so more people may come into the Kingdom.
 And so a lot of you, you need to change your mindset because you don't see yourself as bold.
 You're like, oh, that's not my personality. God is calling you to be bold like a lion. He's calling
 every single person to be bold like a lion. And God will use you powerfully. Maybe you are not a
 good salesman or woman in the world. But every one of you can be the most amazing, successful
 salesman or woman for Jesus. For his Kingdom. Because it's simply about the anointing and
 obedience. That's it. Nothing else. The anointing and obedience. Because it doesn't matter what your
 personality is. It doesn't matter how you feel. You make the intention to plant seeds in people.
 To go where the Holy Spirit's leading you. To talk about Jesus. To tell people that you're
 people. To go where the Holy Spirit's leading you. To talk about Jesus. To testify. To share
 about deliverance. About revival. And people will be drawn. Because of the anointing in you.
 And the sincerity of your heart. You need to be confident in what you carry. And you need to pour
 your heart out to people. With excellence. Share. Just share your heart. Just share your heart how
 God has changed you. The power of his anointing. Amen. That's it. That's all you need.
 You need to have that mentality. They will not hear if you don't speak up.
 This message is not just for the naturally bold people. The natural extrovert people.
 The natural, this is their personality type people. Loud people. People who like to just go up to
 people and have no problem talking to people. This is for you introverts.
 This is for you too. You gotta open your mouth. And shine your light. And tell people.
 Use your social media. Come on. It's easy. It's not even hard to do what God is asking.
 Second Corinthians 3, 8. Shouldn't we expect far greater glory under the new way now that the
 Holy Spirit is giving life? If the old way which brings condemnation, listen to this, the old way,
 meaning the old covenant way, the old wine way. If the old way which brings condemnation was glorious,
 the reason why it was glorious is it was because they were still worshiping God. They were still
 worshiping God. They were still listening to the words of God. You know what I mean? So it was
 glorious. So if that way, old way was glorious, how much more glorious is the new way which makes
 us right with God? In fact, that first glory was not glorious at all compared with the overwhelming
 glory of the new way. Since this new way gives us, listen to this, since this new way gives us such
 confidence, this new way, this new wine, this, the people that think, people, people testify about
 being free from porn addictions, masturbation addictions, and marriage problems, and they,
 they boldly with joy testify because it's given them so much confidence. It's open. It's like,
 people need this. This saved my life. I want others to experience this. I have confidence to speak this.
 The new wine is so precious. The love of Jesus that is found through the new wine and the anointing
 is so precious that it transforms you and gives you this kind of boldness and confidence that
 you didn't have before. Since this new way gives us such confidence, we can be very bold. We can be.
 Not just the extrovert people. All of us can be very bold.
 We are not like Moses who put a veil over his face so the people of Israel will not see the
 glory even though it's destined to fade away. Verse 16, but whenever someone turns to the Lord,
 the veil is taken away for the Lord is the spirit and wherever the spirit of the Lord is, there is
 freedom. So all, all of us who have had that veil removed, they've, that have come into the new wine
 can see and reflect the glory of the Lord. The light of Jesus will shine through us with no veil
 over us. And the Lord who is the spirit makes us more and more like him as we are changed into his
 glorious image. So remember in the old way, Moses saw God was shining so bright, it was too bright
 for people to handle. In the new way, we shine just as bright as Moses, but even more in the spiritual
 realm. And this is what is attracting people to you because this light in the spiritual realm is
 so powerful that you carry. But you have to arise to shine. You have to speak out. You have to testify,
 not just once in a while, not just once in a month, all the time. Because every single time you do,
 there are people like that were in the woods that are going to grab the book.
 Every time it's going to happen, every time powerful seeds will be planted. Hallelujah.
 And so I was just thinking about when, when my spiritual daughter told me the story about how
 one person, she shared on her Facebook and this one harvest came through her. And this woman,
 her face was full of joy and she's come into the kingdom and is experienced in the new wine and the
 anointing. And I was just thinking, what if every single person here at Firefold Church
 and watching online across the world, what if you all did that?
 Not just once in a while, but regularly. What if you shared on your social media
 about what God is doing, about this revival, about your testimony?
 What if you shared the book? What if you unlock your deliverance? What if you shared the videos?
 What if you made the intention everywhere you go each day to be the light, to talk about this
 revival, to share your testimony? And I know I've shared in the past, I've shared in the past,
 like the religious way of evangelizing is like really forceful. And it can also be like,
 I got to get nachos on my belt and I have to evangelize to every single person I see or God's
 mad at me. This is how the religious voice can speak. And I've taught a lot, I've taught before
 in the past, in past messages, I've taught about how many times just showing love to somebody is
 what God wants you to do in that moment. You don't have to feel like you have to speak the gospel to
 every single person. Because many times it's very important to not be forceful, but to be led by the
 Holy Spirit and see if a person's open. So that still remains, but I want to make sure you're not
 sitting back too much because of this prophetic season that we are in. That if you feel an urge
 to start just sharing your testimony with somebody, if you just feel this urge like,
 hey, like I don't know if you're interested in this or whatever, but I just feel led to just share
 this with you right now, to just share about this book or you know what God's doing.
 God's going to be putting that unction in you. And you're going to be amazed by people say,
 how did you know? You're going to be amazed by how the prophetic anointing starts to work through
 you if you'll start obeying him as he prophetically leads you. So stop being shy, rise up, be bold.
 I want to encourage every one of you, I really want us to run. Many of you are walking. Many of
 you are not taking this seriously on your social media, for example. I want to encourage all of you
 to really make a commitment to this, to this word today, to this assignment from God.
 And I want to encourage every one of you this week, this week, every one of you who has a social
 media, I'm pretty sure that's most people here. If you don't have social media, find another way,
 call up somebody or something and testify. It could be written, it can be a video, but just testify,
 post something on your social media. Maybe you've done it in the past several times, but
 this year is different. So make that intention to testify from your heart, like with all of your
 heart. Like testify as you see these people with Jesus's eyes, having compassion for people
 that are lost and who are hurting and who are confused as sheep without a shepherd.
 See them, meditate on them before you share your testimony and share your testimony with all of
 your heart. And the anointing is going to flow through you so powerfully. And I'm telling you
 that I believe that we will have to start going into the balcony soon because of how you start
 running, because of how the team, it's not just the shooter and one passer, but everybody, all
 five people on the court and in this way, thousands on the basketball court starts running and starts
 playing with excellence, getting a little sweat on, but really running for Jesus now. Are you ready?
 Hallelujah. Let's run for Jesus. Hallelujah. Let's run for Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
 Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Praise God. Praise God. The harvest is now
 and as you respond to this, as you respond to this GPS right now, it's like I see prophetically
 that God's taken us on another revival wave highway, a faster one.
 The GPS has taken us here. So now we have to put our foot pedal to the metal.
 You're ready to put the pedal to the metal. Let's go. Let's run. Let's run. Army of God.
 Let's run. Let's run. Let's run. Run in place as a prophetic act. Run in place where you are right
 now. Run in place. Run in place. Everybody run in place. Watch it online. Get up. Run in place.
 Run around your house. This is a prophetic act. This is your position now as a revival warrior.
 Say, I will run for you, Jesus. I will arise and shine. I will run this race
 with endurance, with passion, determination, and boldness. I will sweat for you, Jesus.
 I will work hard and with excellence. I will be bold and unashamed. I will be loud
 and proud of you, Jesus.
 Hallelujah.
 Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Whoa. Praise God. Praise God.
 Praise God. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. We are going to give to God right now.
 We're going to run in every area. We're going to run with our giving. We're going to run in
 every surrender, every area of surrender in our lives. Amen. Because God wants to run in every
 area. God, God, I see sometimes I see this revival increasing and I even see prophetically
 like having to get bigger venues than we have planned because of the speed at which God is
 taking us. So that's why I say we got to run in every area. We got to serve God in every area
 with excellence and everything in us. Amen. Hallelujah. So as you give today, let this seed
 be a seed in the ground because when you're sowing it produces things in the spiritual realm. So
 sometimes it's very important to sow for a specific reason. Like, it's like, Lord, I want to put
 an action behind the choice I've made in my heart and with my words today. I want to make a sacrifice
 in this believing that you will bring this to harvest, that this will come to pass in my life.
 It's like, it's also like thanking God in advance, thanking God with faith that pleases him and there's
 power in your faith. So much power in your faith and faith without works is dead, the Bible says.
 So I want to encourage you now to sow. I want to encourage you now to sow with this
 purpose that you would have strength and energy to run, encourage, and that no weight
 would hold you down anymore. May this be a stake in the ground where you are different from now.
 You are running from now. Hallelujah. Praise God. If you want to give online, these are the ways,
 5fchurch.org slash give. If you're watching online, you can go to the link in my bio on Instagram
 or 5fchurch.org slash give. Hallelujah. And just lift your seeds up right now. I want to release
 more anointing upon every one of you right now. Thank you, Lord. I release this anointing, more of
 this anointing upon every seed now. Any of you in need financially, I declare doors to open up
 and supernaturally finances to come in your life in Jesus name. May you experience great acceptance
 and favor in Jesus name. Great acceptance and favor that will lead to new opportunities, that
 will lead to new opportunities financially in Jesus name. Thank you, Father. I speak this lack

 Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Praise God! Praise God! Thank you, Jesus. If there's anybody
 who needs freedom in this place, healing. Jesus the deliverer and healer is here right now
 and moving in power to deliver and heal you right now. I want to encourage everyone,
 if you need deliverance, if you have, if you're sensing demonic manifestation, come to the front
 and I want to invite every single one of you right now to close your eyes and take a moment with Jesus
 and just speak to him according to what he spoke to you in the message because I know he was speaking
 to many of you, he was convicting you. Some of you you need to surrender fully, some of you
 you've held on to your personality and haven't been bold and it's time to say, Lord, I will do
 the uncomfortable, I will be bold for you. Some of you you need to take off some weights that you've
 been holding on to, some of you need to decide right now to never listen to the enemy's lies,
 whatever he's been speaking to you because God is for you. He is for you. He never condemns.
 Hallelujah. So just take a moment and speak with Jesus. Surrender if you need to,
 whatever you haven't surrendered. Those of you that need freedom, surrender to God,
 allowing him to deliver you, touch you however he wants, however he wants to deliver you.

 members, I call them into the kingdom now. Those who have been resistant before, I call them into
 the kingdom in Jesus name. May their eyes open up. May the anointing touch them now where they are.
 Where they are in the world. May they be touched now in Jesus name. Thank you Jesus. Thank you.
 Yes I'm coming hon. I'm coming right there in a second hon. I wanted to mention, I shared this
 video of that whole family from Germany. Did you see the whole family? There's, they don't even
 speak in the English language. There's, there's the elderly that they were Christians for so long but
 just now they're experiencing freedom. They're experiencing transformation in Christ and this
 family is being planted now and I wanted to also mention in this word for you to know it's time
 to run is that if God can do that all the way in Germany, they're not even physically here
 but God can do that. All of those family members, elderly included, what can he do in your life,
 in your family? Not just your, not just your family physically but every person in your life.
 The harvest is now. The barriers of religion that have been so strong in the past that caps
 elderly from receiving this new wine. The barriers of religion that keep people from receiving the
 anointing through his servants. Like the weak and foolish things like what servants he chooses that
 are young or our woman for example. You know and the new wine that is so resistant to the old wine,
 the old wine can't come and be a part of. So many like the elderly we haven't seen them come in but
 they're coming in now. They're coming into the revival. Men are coming into the revival.
 So plant your seeds everywhere. Everywhere you never have before. Everywhere you did in the past
 keep planting. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It's time for whole families, elderly and the young and in
 between to come. Hallelujah. Come here hun. Can you come honey? Can you stand right here?
 God is freeing you right now. God is freeing you right now with the spirit of death and cancer.
 And it's eating away at my chest and it went into my brain and now it's going into my
 pelvic area. My hips and also my spine has been locked over 20 years and now my surgery on my
 hands but now my thumbs don't work and I know the enemy wants my face but I don't want to give it.
 He gave it to him because Jesus is my healer. Yes, Jesus is your healer and there's nothing he
 cannot do. There's no sickness too big for him and he's bringing healing to you now. I break every
 generational curse off your life. I break every curse of death. I cancel every covenant of death.
 I break every word curse spoken over your life and I detach you from what you have renounced.

 If you want revival, you have to be wild for Jesus. You have to be wild.
 You can't be normal. You have to be wild if you want revival because if you will allow God,
 if you will allow God, the Spirit of the Lord will overtake you.
 There's stories in the Bible of people just dancing like David, even Saul. They start dancing
 wildly because they surrendered and they allow the Spirit of God to overtake them.
 You see what happened to that woman? I'm going to preach the gospel. I'm going to preach the gospel.
 That's the Spirit of God. That's the fire of the Holy Spirit. That's what God wants from all of
 you to be wild, to allow his fire to ignite you. This is how you be a bright light. The world wants
 this. Some people may say you're weird but you planted a seed. Other people will say I want that
 drug. The people on the day of Pentecost, they called them drunk. They thought they were drunk.
 God wants to use your wildness to get people's attention.
 Hallelujah! We got to be wild. We got to be bold. We got to be fiery.
 Woo! This is revival! This is revival! This is revival! Woo! Woo!
 God is pouring out more fire.
 Some of you need more fire to be bold. It's time to receive it.
 Some of you have surrendered to God today and now he's going to give you the fire you need to
 finally be bold. Lift your hands up to God and say Jesus, I will be wild for you. I don't care
 what people think, what people say. I only care to please you. I will be bold and wild and loud
 for you. I release the fire upon you now. I release the fire. Be filled with the fire of
 the Holy Spirit. Be filled. Pray in the Spirit. Pray in the Spirit. Receive more fire.
 Let the fire come upon you more, more, more. If you've never been baptized,
 receive, receive the fire of the Holy Spirit now. Receive, praise God, more fire. If you couldn't be
 bold before, receive more fire to be bold now. More fire, more fire, more fire, more fire.
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. I see faith is lifted for any miracle to happen,
 any freedom, any healing can happen right now. I detach you all from what you have renounced,
 lists you abroad. If you didn't renounce, start speaking. I detach you from it all right now.
 I break every curse off your life and I declare every spirit attached to what you renounced,
 everyone here and watching must go now in Jesus' name. Praise God. I declare all addiction must go.

 Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Father. Everything that held you back from being bold,
 may it be removed. And I speak over every person. Be healed from everything, from everything in your
 body that's not working. Be healed in Jesus' name. And I send this anointing to every family member,
 to people, the pictures you're holding up. I send this anointing to them and I declare this anointing
 to touch them and healing and freedom to come to them and breakthrough to come to them now
 in Jesus' name. I declare this week that as you run, as you run like never before,
 may you bring in so many fish. May you be great fishers of men and women. May you be successful
 fishermen and fisherwomen. Oh, may the people be drawn to the anointing in you.
 May the people in your workplace, in your family, those on your social media pages, may they be

 to these people, all of them in your life right now. All of them, your workplace, your social media
 people from your past, the followers you have, your family. I send the anointing to all of them.
 Like how Jesus sent the anointing to the fish to be attracted to come in that net. I send that
 anointing to them now, that their eyes would open, that hunger would come for God in them,
 in Jesus' name. As you speak this week, may your words carry power and fire and boldness,
 like never before. May miracles take place through you. When people need a miracle, let God move,
 may God move through you and touch them in Jesus' name. Some of you, God is going to be sending
 you to places to bring healing chain. Real quick, share your testimony this week. Two different
 things happened. Yeah, at work there was a woman who had a seizure and I was able to pray for her
 and the symptoms died down and I think she's okay, glory to God. And as I was leaving work,
 on another day in the same week, a man was, he wasn't having a seizure but he was foaming out
 his mouth. He was unconscious and I prayed for him too and I was so close to calling 911 and just
 before I called 911 he woke up and two fatal instances but all glory to God. Thank you Jesus.
 The anointing be poured in through you, mama. Praise God.
 So two almost fatal instances and I remember you haven't seen that happen before.
 That's never happened to me in my entire life. I never seen anyone have a seizure before.
 I never even prayed for anyone before in that much of like a vital circumstance and twice in
 one week and it reminded me of, I know it wasn't a span of one week but you know you saw a snake,
 you trample on a snake and then you saw a snake again on a hike. It wasn't a similar week but just
 God's doing something. Yeah. Yes! Because new levels of impartation has been released
 to you. New levels of impartation has been released to all of you at Arise and Shine
 and now you're going to start seeing things like this happen where God is sending you
 to release the anointing to move through you and touch people. This is going to be happening. Be
 on the lookout. Run and save and heal and deliver people by God's power. Amen? Run for Jesus.
 Run for Jesus. Run with your torch. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. May this anointing increase in you
 and may many miracles take place through you in Jesus name.
 Fear, I speak fear to leave you now and I declare all bondage and sickness gone.
 Be free and healed now in Jesus name. Thank you Jesus. My wife, I brought her to you about a year
 ago. She had suffered from chronic autoimmune for about five years even being bedridden and we were
 like chasing anointing kind of thing and I brought her to ask you to pray for her. I believe she was
 going to be healed and she is completely healed. Completely healed. And I just, I had never, I
 brought her to you and I never asked for anything. I've come to see you a lot. I've never asked for
 a healing touch for myself. My back's been going out for like two months. I almost felt selfish
 even asking for it today but I'm believing God's going to heal me even if I could just
 touch the hem of your garment. Glory to God. Stand right here. God is going to heal you right now
 and they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony. You testifying right now
