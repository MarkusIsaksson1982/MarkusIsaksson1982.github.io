uh I want to uh R.J from Canada hi can you come here
45:46
hi I hear you have a testimony i would love you to share this testimony
45:53
from the airport we just arrived from Vancouver so I want to introduce myself
45:58
my name is R.J i was here I think 20 23rd of August um so I learned about you
46:05
Apostle Katherine when uh I was a part of an international prayer group and
46:10
they told me about you because you visited Dubai and they said the anointing was so heavy so at the time I
46:17
kept on fainting because I had indometriosis and I really wanted God to heal me and it was so desperate and I
46:24
wanted God to move in my family so I brought my husband and my son my two-year-old son to Toronto Canada that
46:32
was way back in um May I think of 2023rd that you went there and you declared in
46:38
the crowd that God is healing indometriosis and I lifted up my hands i did not even have manifestation as soon
46:46
as I went to the airport flying back to Canada I Vancouver I had no symptom at
46:52
all as in gone gone literally gone so I
46:57
stopped having the fainting episode immediately immediately and so my husband we were so amazed at what God
47:05
did and then three months after that August my my my coworker because I'm a
47:11
nurse so she I I do Bible study with her and then she was a little bit suicidal
47:18
so my husband said "Bring her to 5 Church." So we went back we came to the other building and then so I brought her
47:24
with here and then she received she prayed for her and since then she never
47:30
got the suicidal thoughts never yeah never had yeah and then yeah God has
47:38
been so amazing and then um after that we went through the fire my whole family
47:46
so this is my daughter Michaela she is a living testimony of God's power so after
47:53
that uh visit in August actually with my coworker that you prayed for societal
47:59
thoughts you came back to in the crowd and prayed for me and you said I pray that you will come back and bring in
48:05
more people and then I think that's why I have Michaela here my daughter and I have my coworker there Emanuel as well
48:13
she's coming so I want to thank the Lord Apostle
48:19
Katherine so after that I think you release some anointing painting in our family
48:24
so that was August uh September October November December so November 3 months
48:30
after we flew back to the Philippines we're Filipinos we had a vacation there
48:36
and you know we're ner I'm a nurse so we thought we need to have a vacation we've been working so hard with the COVID we
48:42
wanted to just have a small vacation it did not turn out to be a wonderful vacation but December 28 2023 in the
48:51
hotel my daughter had a first time seizure full-blown seizure she coded she
48:57
turned blue in front of me and my husband in the hotel and she died so I
49:03
checked on her pal she was gone like totally gone the night before my husband
49:09
had a dream and he saw my daughter in a coffin but he did not tell me because he
49:16
know I'm going to get worried so the following day as soon as I I know the
49:21
anointing I I know there was an impartation because literally after that we prayed we were crying moaning wailing
49:28
inside the hotel and I remember I said "Mikuela you're not going to live you're
49:34
not going to die but you're going to live in Jesus' name." And we kept repeating it repeating it while doing
49:40
CPR and then I think less than 5 minutes or so we saw her coming back to life
49:48
like started raising we were like wailing moaning all of a sudden she's alive
50:02
so thank you thank you so I know that God is so real because
50:08
the anointing is so real since that visit it was never the same for our family we went through the fire my
50:15
husband also would love to preach in the Philippines in the villages and he was saying about miracles and this happened
50:22
and after that my daughter was in she came back to life but it was a long time
50:27
of hospitalization she was in ICU for four months she was flown from the
50:32
Philippines back to Canada on ventilator we were picked up by air ambulance and
50:39
then a series of events happened we saw some manifestation some demonic
50:45
manifestation during that time and we prayed for her it was a long battle i
50:50
wanted to bring her right away to 5F at that moment but I couldn't because she was on ventilator now is a perfect time
50:57
because finally she's able to come here and testify so yeah
51:04
yeah so yeah she's she was she was 20 years old
51:11
and she was in ICU on her birthday but God redeemed her there were things
51:16
probably in her life that she needs to surrender so the enemy also had this attack on her and I want to ask because
51:23
in our family I remember I think it's a generational curse as well my my um my
51:30
grandma uh committed suicide and there was a suicidal thoughts in the family
51:36
and also there is a lot of autoimmune disease so the autoimmune was the one
51:41
who caused the seizure it attacked her brain and she couldn't remember anything
51:47
not at all even her name so we started with that until God kept um God kept
51:53
telling me and my husband to keep declaring that she's a singer she loves to sing she's a worship leader and so
51:59
last week it was her first time back on the stage singing worship to God to lead
52:05
and so I just want to pray ask for prayer that you know that that that
52:10
generational curse and she wants to go back to school so right now the treatment for her is every six months to
52:17
tame the the immune system and so she she wants to go back to school right Mikuela and she wants to be fully healed
52:25
we know that she's healed you want that and um so yeah that's why we're here and
52:30
another thing is I have a friend who has cancer as well i just want to show her picture to you because I promised her
52:36
that I'm going to show the picture to you so this is Ardell she right now has
52:42
bone cancer from breast cancer it metastasized to the bones and um she
52:48
really wants to live she really want to testify what the Lord has done so she's asking for prayers yeah amen i want to

whoever is in need more miracles thank you Lord well I'm going to go into the
56:46
word right now now are you ready for the word of God i'm teaching today the title of this
56:54
message is about the father's business i forgot it was Father's Day when I when
57:01
I when I came up with this message when God gave me this message this is a perfect prophetic message about the
57:08
father's business jesus says Luke 2:49 "And he said to them,"Wh did you seek me
57:17
did you not know that I must be about my father's business
57:27
i must be about my father's business." Jesus said
57:37
what Jesus came to do on this earth besides going on the cross to die for us
57:42
besides that it was an example for us
57:48
he set an example for us we don't have to go on the cross glory to God because he he took he took the our this our sins
57:55
from us he took the suffering from us he made this ultimate sacrifice for us
58:00
hallelujah we don't have to go on the cross but we do have to pick up our own cross in the spiritual realm
58:07
so even that is an example in a way amen so
58:13
everything that Jesus came to do on this earth was to show us an example we are to we are to do what he did and
58:22
he was about his father's business
58:27
what's the father's business well first of all the father's business is his whole heart first of all
58:34
his business is the saving of souls revealing his love to every person on
58:41
this earth healing the sick freeing the oppressed
58:47
raising the dead breaking curses destroying every work of
58:52
the devil and releasing abundant life releasing peace releasing joy
59:01
bringing people into a relationship with him that's the father's business
59:09
and that is what Jesus was about he was all about the father's business
59:18
and we too are called to be about our
59:23
father's business
59:29
to be about our father's business means to be devoted to the father's business
59:37
it means that to be about that means that is what we are living for that is
59:43
that is our purpose that is our calling that is our focus that is our mission
59:49
that is where we put our heart because that's where God's heart is because we
59:55
are united with God's heart we are after his heart to be after God's heart is to
1:00:01
be about his business about the father's business
1:00:06
hallelujah praise God
1:00:16
luke 8 verse1 says "Soon afterward Jesus began a tour of the nearby towns and
1:00:22
villages preaching and announcing the good news about the kingdom of God he
1:00:27
took his 12 disciples with him along with some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases among them
1:00:36
were Mary Magdalene from whom he had cast out seven demons Joanna the wife of
1:00:41
Chuza Herod's business manager Susanna and many others who were contributing from
1:00:48
their own resources to support Jesus and his disciples
1:00:53
so it says that Jesus was casting out demons was healing
1:01:00
the sick he was doing miracles and when he revealed his love and power
1:01:07
saving these people freeing these people healing these people they then became
1:01:13
his disciples and followed him they didn't just receive the healing receive
1:01:19
the freedom receive the salvation and go about their life as usual
1:01:26
they became disciples they became about the father's business
1:01:33
with Jesus they became partners they became I mean
1:01:38
they followed him they followed him everywhere they followed him everywhere not just to hear his teachings
1:01:47
not just to keep on receiving from him but they followed him everywhere to join
1:01:54
him be a partner with him in the father's business to assist him in the
1:02:00
father's business this scripture is powerful because it's not saying you know they were healed and
1:02:07
they were delivered and they were just keeping on needing to be being set free again and again and they needed more and more demons cast out of them they just
1:02:14
kept they just followed Jesus and kept receiving it says they were healed they
1:02:19
were freed and then they followed him they assisted and contributed to the
1:02:26
ministry
1:02:33
many others who were contributing contributing to the ministry from their
1:02:38
own resources to support Jesus and his disciples
1:02:46
that's where the focus was because when God heals you and frees you and saves
1:02:51
you you don't need more freedom
1:02:58
he's done it he's destroyed the works of the devil in
1:03:04
your life he's given you abundant life and now you you have now been blessed to
1:03:11
become a blessing you've been set free to help other people be set free
1:03:18
you've been saved to help other people be saved you've been healed to help others be healed
1:03:24
you've encountered God's love your eyes have been opened up to his love to help
1:03:30
others eyes open up to his love
1:03:35
and the main place where healing is happening freedom is happening
1:03:42
the power of God is demonstrated and people are being equipped to be vessels
1:03:48
of God and receive impartation to be anointed vessels of God
1:03:53
the main place that happens is in the church
1:03:58
when you look in the book of Acts this is our example of what church looked like this is our example of what
1:04:06
a believer's life looked like and it would say that
1:04:12
the people the people in the church the believers were continually in awe of the
1:04:18
signs and wonders performed by the apostles
1:04:23
it also says that all believers these signs shall follow them they shall
1:04:28
heal the lay hands on the sick and they will be healed they shall cast out demons these are some of the signs that
1:04:34
it talks about all believers so yes we are all called to walk in
1:04:41
miracles we are all called to that but when we read the Bible when we read
1:04:48
the Acts church the main place where we hear miracles
1:04:54
taking place people being equipped the power of God being demonstrated is the
1:05:00
church the believers are are the believers are
1:05:07
equipped by the five-fold ministry ephesians 4:11-16 so these leaders are given more
1:05:14
anointing a higher level of anointing a higher level of understanding of the scriptures
1:05:19
a higher level of maturity for the purpose of equipping others so that you
1:05:24
have someone to imitate as Paul says imitate me as I imitate Christ follow me
1:05:30
as I follow Christ amen amen so for the believers to walk
1:05:36
in miracles that these signs shall follow them and for them to do it in
1:05:42
God's order not just any old way and being led by the angel the devil
1:05:48
masquerading himself as an angel of light and doing in religion and old wine for believers to walk in miracles and be
1:05:55
in God's order they have to be equipped they have to be equipped in the church
1:06:02
so the church the ministry coming here is the main place of God doing his work
1:06:10
and then it's an overflow through you all into the world as you go out into the world
1:06:17
you receive anointing you receive the love of God the demonstration of the power of God comes upon your life you're
1:06:22
baptized in the Holy Spirit here you're healed you're set free so you're not held back by the enemy anymore you're
1:06:29
given the word of God you're giving wisdom so you can discern
1:06:34
you can discern between the the devil's voice and God's voice and so now you're ready to go out in the world and to
1:06:41
really be a representative of Jesus god can use you powerfully because of
1:06:48
what you have received in the church it can't happen any other way because
1:06:54
this is God's order you cannot be equipped on your own without the church without the church
1:07:01
where God has called you to be planted at and when we read the Bible when we read
1:07:07
the Bible Old Testament to New Testament every example we see of miracles taking
1:07:13
place is through a vessel every miracle that is described
1:07:23
so it doesn't mean that God can't do a miracle without a vessel but what it does mean is that this is God's way of
1:07:31
releasing miracles like his this is his principle and his way he can do it outside when it's needed
1:07:39
when someone's crying out to God in their room and there's not a vessel around they don't know how to get to a vessel they never heard about a church
1:07:45
they never heard about a church where God's power is moving he can come and touch them i know that's
1:07:50
happened for many of you here but there have been so many of you where
1:07:57
you've been oppressed you've been sick you've never encountered God's power you didn't have revelation really of his
1:08:02
love but you instead had religion and for years and years and years and years you cried out for freedom you cried out
1:08:08
for healing you cried out to really know his love
1:08:13
and nothing ever happened until you came to a church where God's power was moving
1:08:20
that's because it's God's main way of moving and he was causing you to be hungry and seek and he would guide you
1:08:27
to where to go once you would actually seek he would put videos up on your social
1:08:34
media for example once you were seeking you start desiring to you know you
1:08:41
instead of your normal social media scroll of worldly things you start to search for for for videos about God and
1:08:50
as you search there that's where God can bring a video now where his anointing is
1:08:58
moving so he answered your prayer but it involved you to it involved you seeking
1:09:04
him to find him when you seek me with all your heart then you will find me as the Bible says
1:09:12
hallelujah so it's important you understand the
1:09:17
importance of the church if you are not if you have not experience the church where God's power is you won't
1:09:24
understand the importance of the church
1:09:30
because then it's just a place where you're hearing a good message but not being changed you're hearing a good
1:09:36
message but you still have demons you make some Christian friends but
1:09:42
they're lukewarm and have oppression themselves and are used by the enemy and it's a mess
1:09:51
so you won't understand the importance of the church so so part of your eyes being opened up
1:09:58
and coming into the new wine is having revelation of the necessity of the
1:10:05
church the importance of the church understanding this is the core of God's work
1:10:15
for the most amount of people to be reached in this world depends on the church being strong and people being
1:10:23
committed to the church being truly planted being true disciples
1:10:28
so that you can receive all that God needs you to receive to go out in the
1:10:33
world and to be a powerful vessel of him
1:10:39
hallelujah so notice that when in the scripture we
1:10:48
just read soon afterward Jesus began a tour of the
1:10:53
nearby towns and villages preaching and announcing the good news about the kingdom of God he took his 12 disciples
1:10:58
with him along with some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases among them were Mary Magdalene from whom he had cast out seven demons Joanna the
1:11:04
wife of Choosa Susanna and many others who were contributing from their own resources resources to support Jesus and
1:11:10
his disciples so notice that when Mary Magdalene when the others were set free
1:11:15
from demons when they were when the others who were healed
1:11:22
they didn't just go and do their own thing they didn't just go and start
1:11:28
their own ministry day one or year one after being delivered
1:11:38
they didn't just stay with Jesus for some months gain some wisdom from the
1:11:44
teaching and think they can just go out and start their own ministry or do the work of God
1:11:51
their own way but they they realized that Jesus had saved them
1:11:58
healed them and delivered them and they realized that they that God was calling them to be a part of what saved them
1:12:06
healed them delivered them not to be prideful and think you can
1:12:11
just go do this on your own but value what you have received see the
1:12:18
preciousness of it and have the heart for other people to receive what you
1:12:23
have received so they joined Jesus they helped Jesus
1:12:28
they served Jesus they contributed financially from their own resources to support Jesus's ministry so that this
1:12:36
work of God could go to different cities to different places
1:12:44
that wouldn't have been possible if they hadn't supported if they hadn't devoted themselves and truly been about the
1:12:51
father's business so you are set free
1:13:00
god has freed you not just for you to enjoy being free now
1:13:07
but he's freed you so you can fulfill your purpose now
1:13:13
which is to be about your father's business to contribute to this work of God where you have found that freedom
1:13:20
where you have encountered God's love this is your purpose
1:13:26
this is why you are here you are here to be about your father's
1:13:33
business about fully devoted hallelujah
1:13:44
so I want to ask you a question
1:13:49
is your father's business are you really about your father's
1:13:55
business is it what's most important to you is it what you are devoted to the most
1:14:03
or is it a side hobby
1:14:08
is your father's business a side hobby
1:14:15
your devotion your contribution to the father's business is that 10% of your
1:14:22
life 10% of what you are blessed with
1:14:28
is it 10% of your gifts is it 10% of your finances or is it 100%
1:14:36
amen praise God i hear somebody some people say 100% amen this is a question
1:14:42
for all of you you don't have to answer it's something I want you to think about
1:14:48
are you fully devoted to the father's business because in the Christian culture of
1:14:55
today I would say it's not normal to be 100%
1:15:00
devoted to the father's business i would say it's more common to be 10%
1:15:06
or maybe 20 or 30% and I'm talking about everything i'm talking about your heart
1:15:12
like your heart like meditating on what God has done for you
1:15:18
and how you want to give thanks to him for what he's done for you and
1:15:24
meditating on being after his heart and what that means the greatest commandment is to love the Lord God with all your
1:15:30
heart and love people love his people
1:15:36
are you meditating on that truth regularly are you making intention to love God's
1:15:42
people are you doing what is necessary to love
1:15:48
God's people the biggest thing you can do to love God's people is to be about the father's
1:15:55
business the greatest love you can show anybody
1:16:02
is leading them to where God is moving in power
1:16:10
because if you just simply if you if you're ashamed to say if you're ashamed to testify where you have received for
1:16:17
example and you just simply share something like
1:16:23
God loves you but you hold back sharing your testimony maybe on your social media you talk about God
1:16:31
but you do not direct people to his kingdom on this earth where he is moving in
1:16:38
power his revival you know
1:16:45
they they they are not being led to receive freedom when you lead people to where God's
1:16:52
power is moving you're leading them to receive what you have received to be free to be healed to encounter God's
1:16:57
power to be equipped to be a powerful vessel of God to fulfill their purpose on this earth amen
1:17:03
and it's not just testifying i mean being about the father's business means
1:17:08
these things serving serving God in his work
1:17:16
sharing your testimony sharing what God is doing verbally with people in your
1:17:21
life but also on social media to the highest extent using creativity
1:17:28
to get the word out about revival about God's power moving that set you
1:17:35
free and set thousands free all over the world and healed thousands and reveal God's love that led people into true
1:17:42
surrender and be on fire serving God is testifying that's a big
1:17:48
part of it serving God is using your gifts and your
1:17:54
time to serve him in his ministry in his work where he is in the church
1:18:01
and if you're not physically like in LA or if you are but there's not something for you to do to serve
1:18:08
you can do so much through your social media spreading the good news sharing the videos getting flyers and handing
1:18:15
them out that's spreading the good news that's serving God amen
1:18:21
so it's using your gifts for God it's using your abilities for God that's being about your father's business it's
1:18:27
using your time your energy your strength for God that's being about your father's
1:18:33
business and also being about your father's business is contributing
1:18:39
financially to the work of God because to receive the gospel healing
1:18:46
and freedom to receive a prophetic word to receive
1:18:52
the anointing is free it is completely free for anybody to
1:18:59
receive it it is free they don't have to pay anything to receive salvation healing freedom the anointing
1:19:06
impartation it is 100% free
1:19:13
but for the work of God to be taken to those people to freely receive for the
1:19:20
word of God to be taken city to city nation to nation for the word of God to be taken to LA week after week here
1:19:27
downtown LA it costs not just a little bit of money
1:19:32
it costs a lot of money
1:19:37
especially in the times we live in now God says you Jesus says you will do greater things than I than I did part of
1:19:44
the greater things is that we can reach more nations than Jesus did when he ministered on this earth
1:19:52
because of social media number one but also because of planes
1:20:00
yeah so yeah you know like in in the
1:20:05
scripture that we that we read about them contributing to the ministry of Jesus
1:20:11
they they were funding the trips
1:20:16
the the travel the lodging the food and anything that was needed for the
1:20:21
ministry uh the the church service to happen
1:20:28
but they didn't have to pay for flight tickets they didn't have to pay for
1:20:37
venues that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars sometimes $100,000 or $60,000 or in
1:20:46
between so there's a cost to the greater things
1:20:54
we will do greater things but it comes with a cost we get to do greater things but it comes with a cost
1:21:04
and so back then they're contributing financially to the ministry of Jesus now we are called to do the same thing but
1:21:11
we got to step it up
1:21:17
you know it the the the funding of the work of God going all over the world it
1:21:24
can't happen when people are not fully about the father's business
1:21:30
it won't happen it won't happen if all the believers are just giving a part of
1:21:35
themselves to the work of God it can't happen in mainstream Christian
1:21:41
culture today the way mainstream Christian culture of
1:21:46
today is lukewarm and just gives a a percentage or a very small percentage of
1:21:52
themselves their time their giftings their finances to the work of God
1:21:59
we got to step all the way into the new wine if we want the new wine revival it
1:22:05
comes with a cost
1:22:12
and it's such a reward to be a part of the revival to not be a bystander but be
1:22:18
a part of the revival there's no greater joy than that there's no no greater joy in being one who laid the bricks
1:22:28
built the house you know for this work of God
1:22:34
to not just stand there and watch it but actually be a part to actually look around and see all the testimonies you
1:22:40
know those of you that give to 5F Church you were a part of the testimony that was
1:22:46
here she shared of one woman being free completely free of suicidal thoughts
1:22:53
she may only be alive today because she came to 5F Church and God touched her in power
1:23:00
she's only alive today that woman because people gave
1:23:08
you gave to the work of God
1:23:14
truly isn't that powerful
1:23:19
does that give you joy that gives me joy i don't think there's any greater joy
1:23:28
than to like be a partner with the hero Jesus
1:23:34
like cuz God doesn't God chooses to use
1:23:40
vessels he wants to use vessels to do everything sometimes they aren't willing so he he
1:23:47
does things without a vessel sometimes but he wants to use vessels that's his main way of releasing his word releasing
1:23:53
equipping releasing impartation releasing healing releasing freedom releasing the baptism of the Holy Spirit
1:23:59
breaking curses revealing his love through a prophetic word that's what he wants that's just
1:24:05
his way why that's just his way that's what he's chosen that's what he wants
1:24:12
and so if you think about it it's like the hero Jesus is the one that saved
1:24:17
healed delivered saved the woman from committing suicide but he needed to use
1:24:22
a vessel i mean this like in a humble way but I
1:24:28
want you to understand i want you to have the joy of a great work that you do as you contribute to the work of God
1:24:37
the hero Jesus needed you you became one with the hero
1:24:43
like that's your value you know
1:24:49
there's a great reward into contributing to the work of God with all your heart
1:24:56
being fully about the father's business there's a great reward of joy the joy of
1:25:02
seeing the father proud of you and the joy of fulfilling your purpose on this earth the contentment that brings and
1:25:09
the joy of seeing someone be saved and healed and delivered because of your obedience
1:25:16
no greater joy than that hallelujah hallelujah
1:25:28
so I want to ask you are you living are you living today are you living your
1:25:33
life by what society says
1:25:42
like how you're living your life how you are using your money how you are using
1:25:47
your time how you are using your giftings
1:25:52
are you in autopilot and living how society how even mainstream Christian
1:25:59
society that you've learned culture that you've learned by what they say is right
1:26:08
or are you fully in the new wine fully surrendered and giving everything to
1:26:14
Jesus and removing yourself from culture removing yourself from what culture and
1:26:21
society says you're entitled to
1:26:26
i've removed myself out of culture out of Christian culture mainstream Christian culture of what um they say
1:26:35
I'm entitled to my life would be so different right now
1:26:43
i would have a lot more things material things
1:26:50
material things that are are are a good not a bad thing to have but just in God's timing
1:26:56
i would have a lot more things dreams i would have good dreams godly
1:27:02
dreams but I would have a lot of those things right now long ago
1:27:09
years ago i would have these things if I lived by what mainstream Christian
1:27:15
culture says I should be entitled to by my age
1:27:22
by my income by
1:27:28
the desires of my heart but I've chosen
1:27:35
to surrender everything to Jesus and to be not 10% about my father's
1:27:41
business not 50% about my father's business but 100% about my father's business
1:27:55
and I don't reveal these things personally maybe I will because there's wisdom in sharing your testimony like
1:28:01
what God wants you to reveal in terms of what you sacrifice you know I don't reveal all these things personally now
1:28:07
maybe maybe later in God's timing but I think if people looked like inside like
1:28:12
got a peek inside they'd be like "What you're weird
1:28:18
get yourself that buy yourself that." You know
1:28:24
they wouldn't understand spend your time doing this sometimes
1:28:32
why do you do the sacrifice christians of today not just the world
1:28:38
Christians of today wouldn't understand what's wrong with having that what's
1:28:43
wrong with doing this what's wrong with buying this
1:28:49
what's wrong it's a good thing it's not a bad thing it's not a impure thing it's not a worldly thing they wouldn't
1:28:55
understand you can only understand when you step
1:29:01
into the new wine and then God gives you revelation
1:29:06
of the importance of his work how his work his business the father's
1:29:13
business is so much more important than the desires of your heart
1:29:20
that he cares about and he'll give you them as you delight in him later
1:29:27
later not now the world says now you should
1:29:33
have them you've already done a lot you've already sacrificed a lot you should have them now you deserve it you
1:29:40
deserved it years ago
1:29:45
but we we tend to put so much we tend to forget that we are not on this earth to
1:29:52
just live a happy life with Jesus and have the desires of our hearts
1:29:58
fulfilled and our dreams come true
1:30:05
and be married in our 20s and 30s and have children and a house and a white
1:30:11
picket fence and the career of our dreams right out of college
1:30:22
but in in Christian in Christian culture of today it's honestly like the father's business
1:30:30
partial percent and like at least 50% the desires of
1:30:35
your heart fulfilled the good godly ones but that that's how many Christians live
1:30:41
because that's their example because that's the culture and because these things these these
1:30:48
monetary things these possessions and and things like marriage and kids
1:30:54
young and everything like they're good things you know like to have a house that's a
1:30:59
good thing there's nothing wrong with that to have a nice car that's a good thing
1:31:04
to have these dreams marriage and children at a young age for example like those are good things
1:31:12
so Christian culture of today they many have a hard time
1:31:19
really getting God's heart of surrender and sacrifice
1:31:26
and that we are not supposed to just throw away the desires of our heart but
1:31:32
we are supposed to hand them to God completely and say Lord have your way i
1:31:37
humble myself and I realize that some of these desires even though they seem godly and good they may not be your
1:31:45
desire for my life like for me I wanted to be a Christian pop EDM singer songwriter
1:31:50
so much i thought that was my calling that's not my calling it was a big desire but it wasn't God's desire
1:32:01
so there's some desires that we need to give to God and be humble and say "I surrender have your way i recognize some
1:32:09
of these desires may not be from you
1:32:15
i humble myself and I surrender them take them away if they're not of you
1:32:20
give me your desires that I don't have that these other desires were taking the space of
1:32:27
make room Lord in my heart for your desires and dreams have your way i surrender
1:32:35
i give you my desires the desires you've given me beautiful desires like such
1:32:40
things as marriage and children and the dream career and having abundance
1:32:46
financially like good godly dreams that are pure dreams i give them all to you
1:32:51
Lord but I truly give them to you which I know means giving you permission to
1:32:58
release them when you want in your timing
1:33:07
if if you are sitting around wondering why hasn't this happened yet why hasn't God fulfilled the desire of
1:33:13
my heart yet you haven't really truly surrendered it to God if you're
1:33:20
complaining you haven't really surrendered it to God you're holding on to it give it to him and as you
1:33:27
surrender everything to him you can rest knowing that it just hasn't happened yet
1:33:32
cuz it's simply not God's timing period simple
1:33:39
you don't need to spend time meditating why isn't it here yet i've sacrificed so
1:33:45
much can't it be here yet waste of time complaining in your mind not trusting
1:33:52
God his timing is best in the new wine it's so different than
1:34:00
the mainstream Christian culture timing of things let me tell you i'll tell you that i'm a testimony to that i'll tell
1:34:07
you it is different but his timing is the best
1:34:12
his timing is the best the very best
1:34:19
his timing is the best he knows best he knows why it shouldn't
1:34:24
come now he knows that when he gives it to you later at the perfect timing it
1:34:29
will come as the sweetest blessing it will bring you the most joy and
1:34:36
you'll be able to handle it and not be distracted by the blessing not start making the blessing your God
1:34:44
all these all these things he knows that we don't really understand we wouldn't understand until we got the blessing prematurely
1:34:51
we just have to trust him amen hallelujah
1:35:00
hebrews 13:16 "Do not forget to do good and to share for with such sacrifices
1:35:08
God is well pleased
1:35:19
god is pleased with your sacrifices
1:35:24
are you making sacrifices that God is asking you to make are you just doing the bare minimum that isn't really a
1:35:32
sacrifice are you feeling the sacrifice you should be feeling the sacrifice that's when you
1:35:37
know it's a sacrifice are you feeling that discomfort then
1:35:42
you're making the sacrifice if you're not feeling a discomfort in
1:35:48
some area you're probably not sacrificing you're probably not doing enough you're probably not being fully
1:35:53
about your father's business god is so pleased when we make
1:35:59
sacrifices sacrifices not in the religion way of just people doing performance to try to
1:36:07
achieve righteousness and making sacrifices of reading the Bible for so many hours and praying in
1:36:14
so many hours but not being led in the Holy Spirit and just doing it just to achieve righteousness you know no those
1:36:21
sacrifices God isn't pleased with but there are many sacrifices that God will
1:36:27
ask you to make in obedience to him and Those sacrifices are so pleasing to him
1:36:40
matthew 16:25 "If you try to hang on to your life you will lose it but if you give up your life for my sake you will
1:36:46
save it." Sacrifices are so beautiful and precious to us and so beautiful to God because
1:36:53
when you make a sacrifice it is an action step of surrender
1:36:59
it's a taking action of surrendering more to God
1:37:04
we all have more we can surrender to God till we die there's going to be more
1:37:09
every day is a choice of surrender every single day amen
1:37:17
whenever I feel the pain the sting of sacrifice the pain of waiting because I've
1:37:22
sacrificed something to God's timing I remember i renew my mind with this
1:37:29
verse and I remember that every time I'm
1:37:35
making a sacrifice God is transforming me more
1:37:40
every single time it doesn't go to waste you make the action of surrender and you
1:37:45
give him the permission to transform you more and make you more like him make you
1:37:51
make you less selfish and more selfless
1:38:01
every single time and so sometimes I feel the sting of sacrifice and I humble
1:38:08
myself and I say God wants to transform me more
1:38:14
god wants more and so I say yes
1:38:19
because this is how I find true life is
1:38:24
to lose my life is to lose more of my life
1:38:31
you're not totally free until you surrender everything to God
1:38:37
your flesh will have a hold on you the selfish desires will have a hold on
1:38:42
you until you surrender everything to God until you continually surrender
1:38:48
everything to God until you continually make sacrifices to God
1:38:54
amen
1:39:00
to sacrifice is making the choice to deny yourself
1:39:07
and do what Jesus is asking you to do
1:39:12
powerful you see the beauty of sacrifice
1:39:18
hallelujah hallelujah matthew 10:5 says Matthew 10:8 says
1:39:27
"Freely you have received freely give."
1:39:34
There's another verse this is another verse that I always remind myself of
1:39:40
when I feel the sting of s of of sacrifice when God's yet again making asking me to
1:39:46
make more sacrifice of of my time my giftings my the sacrifice of waiting and the sacrifice
1:39:53
of finances i have received so much i have received
1:40:01
total abundant life so much all that I have received there's no way that I
1:40:08
could give back there's no way all that you have
1:40:15
received from Jesus there's no way that you could give back to God
1:40:20
the same measure as what you have received there's no way
1:40:26
there's no way the salvation for eternity we're talking
1:40:34
the freedom from the works of the devil in your life the peace you have in your
1:40:40
mind now the joy you have in your life the sense of purpose and contentment with Jesus as your Lord as your best
1:40:46
friend and walking with him fulfilling your purpose
1:40:54
you can serve God all day every day surrender everything and it wouldn't match up to what God has done for you
1:41:03
and he keeps doing that every day so it's it what we give back is just a small
1:41:09
percentage he keeps giving us abundant life peace joy blessings
1:41:15
new blessings new doors open increasing us pouring out his love
1:41:24
every but protecting us every single day
1:41:33
and so man we got to humble ourselves more you got to humble yourselves more
1:41:41
this is our thank you freely we have received we freely give
1:41:47
this is our thank you to God our love offering to God
1:41:53
being about the father's business our contribution to the work of God
1:42:00
and it is not a big enough thank you that we we can never give God a big enough thank you
1:42:06
because it's so massive what he's done for us
1:42:12
so if you ever feel that sting of sacrifice the hard the the the uncomfortability of
1:42:18
the sacrifice humble yourself with this verse with this truth that I'm sharing with you
1:42:26
what God is asking you to give is so small compared to what he's given you and what he's going to give you tomorrow
1:42:31
and what he's going to give you the next day it is so small compared to the reward that is coming
1:42:38
because of that sacrifice you are giving right now that stings the reward that's coming is so much
1:42:45
bigger it's like our now this is humbling thank
1:42:53
you Lord for this revelation this is going to humble some people what's humbling me right now is just got this revelation
1:43:04
it's like God is asking you for
1:43:10
$10,000 right now let's say to give to him to give to his
1:43:15
work it's like I'm not saying he's saying this i'm not saying he's saying this let's get that straight
1:43:26
i'm giving you an an analogy a metaphor right now it's like God is asking you to give him like $10,000 right now today
1:43:34
and he just says "Give it to me i'm going to reward you for this."
1:43:40
And the reward that's coming years from now is a mansion a jet
1:43:50
tons of fancy clothes all your dreams come true now don't get
1:43:56
me wrong i'm not saying that that's what we should be desiring after but I'm trying to help you to see in a physical
1:44:04
way the spiritual reality amen so the worth of the house the worth of a
1:44:12
jet the worth of the fancy clothes and the worth of all your dreams come true
1:44:19
is like billions of dollars right and you're complaining for $10,000
1:44:27
isn't that humbling you're complaining about You feel the
1:44:34
sting of it you're like "This is so hard god I've already given you so much why are you asking this of me i know you'll
1:44:41
reward me but this is hard
1:44:46
this is a lot and God says "The reward I have."
1:44:52
And what he's already given you is the equivalent to all those things monetarily but even more like like in
1:44:58
the spiritual realm it's so much more than that i'm just sharing this as an example to try to help you to understand
1:45:04
do you get me how it doesn't add up what God asks from
1:45:11
us does not add up from what he has given us and will give us
1:45:22
so it requires faith to sacrifice how God is asking you
1:45:27
to sacrifice to give all of yourself it requires faith that God will reward you
1:45:34
that it's worth it doing it not that we do it for a reward but faith that God is so good and he's
1:45:41
not just asking this for you and not seeing that you did this and not giving
1:45:46
you back what you've given and he's not going to just leave you there in lack because of the sacrifice you've given
1:45:52
he's seen it and he will pour out many blessings upon you because you've given
1:46:01
blessing upon blessing upon blessing upon blessing he will reward you so if we could have a stronger faith we would
1:46:10
be giving wildly all the time we would be giving wildly of our giftings of our
1:46:16
time service to God we would be giving wildly spreading the good news of our testimony we would be giving wildly
1:46:24
financially to the work of God if we could have this kind of greater
1:46:29
faith you want to come up higher with your
1:46:35
faith so you can be about the father's business with joy
1:46:42
anybody with me hallelujah [Applause]
1:46:47
hallelujah
1:46:55
praise God praise God
1:47:00
proverbs 3:9 honor the Lord with your wealth and with
1:47:07
the best part of everything you produce then he will fill your barns with grain
1:47:15
and your vats will overflow with wine
1:47:21
proverbs 3:9 Passion translation glorify God with all your wealth honoring him
1:47:28
with your very best your very best
1:47:36
with every increase that comes to you then

every dimension of your life will overflow
1:47:46
with blessings from an uncontainable source of inner joy
1:47:53
woo every dimension of your life every
1:47:59
dimension of your life physically spiritually every dimension of your life

1:48:12
dimension of your life your finances every dimension of your life
1:48:20
will be overflowing when
1:48:25
you give God your best your best
1:48:33
when you are about your father's business not a side hobby that you
1:48:39
participate in sometimes amen
1:48:46
so God is asking for your best today and tomorrow
1:48:51
and next week and every day of your life from now he's asking for your best
1:48:58
he's asking for more he's asking for more sacrifice for the
1:49:03
purpose of his kingdom every sacrifice that God has asked me to make
1:49:10
has been for a purpose the purpose part of the purpose was to
1:49:16
transform me to make me more like him to make me more humble more pure
1:49:24
more selfless more loving of people but every time there was that sacrifice
1:49:30
that led to those things that sacrifice also led to the advancement of God's
1:49:37
kingdom every time like the biggest sacrifices that God has asked me to make the
1:49:44
biggest sacrifices have been
1:49:49
my giftings my abilities my time
1:49:54
to serve him and number two my finances
1:50:03
those have been my two the two biggest areas of sacrifice
1:50:09
and dreams my dreams
1:50:16
but I look and I see I see all the sacrifices that I've made through these years
1:50:23
it'll be this week by the way june 18th is the 8-year anniversary of 5F Church
1:50:30
praise God we will celebrate next Sunday
1:50:38
praise God eight years eight years
1:50:44
yeah four years of revival breaking out but eight years of ministry
1:50:53
every week eight years and so for these eight years and even more eight and a half upon receiving the first prophecy
1:50:59
of prophet receiving the prophecy over my life but for these eight years
1:51:05
every sacrifice that God has asked me to make like for time using uh the sacrifice of my time the sacrifice of
1:51:12
using my gifting and my abilities and my finances
1:51:18
for God's kingdom every sacrifice has not gone to waste
1:51:25
every sacrifice it is not just been for nothing it has not just been like God's asked me to do this just because just to
1:51:31
like test me or something it's like it has led to people being saved and healed
1:51:39
and freed even to this day i know like my personal
1:51:46
sacrifices I know because we more revival events can happen
1:51:53
and so I want you to really understand how sacrifices that God is asking you to make is really leading to
1:52:02
souls being saved and people being healed and people being freed the sacrifices you are making are so
1:52:09
massive like you making a sacrifice of $10,000 and God giving you a m huge mansion not
1:52:18
just anywhere but in LA but I'm trying do you understand like
1:52:23
you're sacrificing what you're sacrificing but it's leading to so much more it's leading to souls being saved
1:52:29
healed and delivered and coming into the kingdom it's so powerful the sacrifice
1:52:37
it's so worth it it's so worth it to deny yourself
1:52:43
to deny the desires of your heart until God's timing to deny yourself the rewards that
1:52:50
society thinks you deserve now to deny yourself for now and let God pour out the reward in his
1:52:57
timing hallelujah let's prioritize souls saved healed and delivered over
1:53:04
the godly desires of our hearts being fulfilled let's prioritize that god wants that to
1:53:11
be priority because in the body of Christ it hasn't been priority god's asking you to make it what if
1:53:18
every one of you made it your your priority the kingdom work the father's business
1:53:24
priority over the desires of your hearts being fulfilled
1:53:30
what if how much more could God do
1:53:36
i know right now we we can be doing more revival events around the world
1:53:44
when when people give more when there are more finances we can be
1:53:50

1:55:34
and I shared this last I shared this last uh Sunday as well but I want to share it again for those of you that
1:55:40
don't know about it and remind you all as well um so 5F church we are you know
1:55:46
there's first of all I want to say to anyone who is watching if you desire for
1:55:52
revival to come to your city to your nation for a revival is now event to come to your city or nation and you
1:55:58
would like to sponsor the event contact us at info5fchurch.org or Amen
1:56:08
um but secondly I want to just share 5F Church we are hosting the London event
1:56:14
we are hosting we are we are hosting all the events but financially we are putting on the London event and the
1:56:22
Minnesota event the Minneapolis event so even though being here downtown LA is
1:56:28
thousands of dollars every single Sunday praise God we are doing more we are
1:56:36
fully funding London and Minnesota
1:56:42
no tickets no completely the donations that come into 5F Church it's it part of
1:56:49
the donations are going to those events so that people can come for free completely free
1:56:56
so um you know even if people give offering give donations that attend the
1:57:02
event it's a very small percentage usually but we believe for more amen we
1:57:07
believe that people will give more but it's usually a small percentage compared to the cost of the event
1:57:14
so it's important that we are not we are at a place of abundance
1:57:20
it is important that we have more than enough that we are not in lack it's it it
1:57:26
requires everyone to be about the father's business and give their best amen
1:57:34
so we still need to raise funds for those events so if you would like to
1:57:39
give to them you can go to 5fchurch.org/events org/events and when you go to the main giving page

it's like I know that's what he's calling me to do and it's just like I every time I start taking a step it's
2:20:05
like I hear voices through other people saying no that's not the right thing to do or just be careful and I just like
2:20:13
keep wrestling back and forth But I know that just the word that was released today and just all the testimonies that
2:20:20
people share it's always what I need in that moment and it's like you can only
2:20:26
