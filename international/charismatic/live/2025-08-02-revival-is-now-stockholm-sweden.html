32:08
Yeah, I'm going to share in English. I just wanted to make an introduction so everyone uh really believes that I'm from Sweden. Uh so I grew up in a
32:17
secular atheist home and when I got a bit older I started to also seek for the
32:22
truth and start to ask bigger questions about life and uh this also led me to
32:28
dive into psychedelic drugs into eastern philosophy into new age. I started to smoke a lot of cannabis etc. And uh this
32:37
path because I thought all like established world religions were just
32:42
made up and uh This path of eastern religions and new age and all of this
32:47
led me to a place of complete darkness, complete confusion.
32:52
I was losing my mind. I suddenly got very depressed uh anxious. I had a lot
32:59
of fear uh and my my fiscal life was working but my internal life I felt
33:06
dead. And in the middle of this process, in the middle of this dark pit that I
33:12
was going through, realizing that everything Everything that I was doing was wrong. This ministry of Firefold Church just popped up in my YouTube feed
33:19
out of nowhere. Yes. And mind you,
33:25
I like I did not have a search history filled with Jesus or anything. It just
33:31
popped up and I started watching what they said was people being delivered
33:37
from demons, people being healed from illnesses, etc. And I was in awe of what
33:43
I saw and I didn't understand it at all. Uh but I started to research it a little bit and there was something to it that
33:49
touched me. And as I kept on watching these deliverance videos, this videos of
33:55
Apostle Katherine releasing the power of God to people. A power started to come
34:00
over me. As I was sitting in my room in front of my computer computer screen, I
34:06
I felt a strong sensation of of of heat, of love, of such intense beauty that I
34:14
have never seen before. And uh tranquility just flooded me and I was
34:20
experiencing so much positive emotion that I hadn't for many months. And so I
34:26
started watching a lot because I was like, there's something to this. And I
34:31
kept watching, kept watching, kept watching. And I found out that Apostle Crick, Apostle Kathern Crick was coming
34:38
to Prague to have a conference. And so I told no one. I told my parents
34:44
that I was going to my summer house cuz I wanted if nothing happened and I was uh tricked, I didn't want anyone to
34:51
know. And uh so I went by myself, took a bus to Pog like 14 hours. I just went there
34:59
with a little bit of faith and a list of things that I did not want in my life and that I confessed that I was guilty
35:05
of in front of God if he existed. And I repented and renounced these things and
35:10
said, "Lord, if you're real, I don't want this in my life." And I stood far back in the crowd the whole service. I
35:17
didn't feel anything. I felt confused and I didn't know who was all
35:23
these strange people around me and what how did I end up here? But then I came home and
35:30
the first step I took off the bus in Sweden, my depression just left me. Just
35:38
it was gone. [Applause] And the next day when I woke up, it was
35:45
still gone. And I was like, whoa. Okay, something happened. Something
35:51
definitely happened. So I kept watching. I kept seeking Jesus. Uh cuz I still had
35:57
a lot of things that I was struggling with. A lot of things like intrusive
36:03
thoughts in my mind so much and uh different things and I just kept on
36:11
believing that all of this was going to go and two weeks later I was a different
36:17
person. Two weeks later, the power of God came over me when I was alone and hit me and spirits left me and I was set
36:26
free from all of the other things too.
36:33
Yes. Yes. And uh since that day, that
36:38
night, that same night, Jesus came to me in a dream, showed his love to me, and
36:44
uh I have never been the same person since. I've never been the same person since. I was freed from I had a 10 plus
36:51
year nicotine addiction. I was watching porn since I was like 13 years old. I
36:57
was addicted to cannabis. I smoked almost every day for three years and so many other things. And from just
37:03
stepping into where the power of God was for like two hours, not even knowing Jesus with a mustard seed of faith and a
37:10
list to renounce things, I was completely set free. Completely.
37:15
Completely. And uh and today that was 2023 on
37:23
resurrection day, April the 7th. And uh today I live my whole life for Jesus. I
37:30
try to do my best to follow him. I am a disciple in Fivefold Church and I have been giga blessed by this ministry. I've
37:37
been blessed beyond understanding. The teachings here are pure. They're meaty
37:42
and uh Jesus has been flowing in my life
37:47
just heavily since that day and uh I've been able to live in purity and follow
37:54
him without things holding me down and uh yeah my life will never be the same.
37:59
Glory to God.
38:07
So that's my testimony. Uh, I'm gonna hand over the mic to Colos Nandos.
38:14
[Applause]
38:23
Hello. Yeah. Hello. My name is Sufalot and I'm from
38:29
Ska and
38:36
I think this is a little bit scary but I couldn't hold this for myself because I
38:43
have been healed and free from so many things. Uh I came across Apostle
38:48
Katherine Crick on Instagram for two years and immediately I knew this is
38:54
God. This is what I have been longing for. And things started just to fell off me.
39:03
I used to have like 10 things going on in my head at the same time. And at the
39:10
same time, a song a different songs was playing on and on. And now it's so quiet
39:17
in my head and
39:23
and I have so much peace and joy. H and before I had severe menopausal
39:30
problems. I went to the doctor get medicine but it didn't helped
39:36
and that's all gone. And that
39:42
that affected our marriage. so much. But now it's totally different. And our
39:51
marriage was not bad before, but now it's it's you can't even describe it.
40:01
You You can't I can't put this in words how
40:06
much this has changed our lives. You can't describe it. so much love and
40:12
peace and we are so blessed and we used to be lukewarm Christians. Um and we
40:20
just followed God on Sundays and maybe one more day and uh we had one step in
40:28
the world and one step in the church. But this this is totally changed now. We
40:36
are so on fire for Jesus.
40:45
and and I love Apostle Katherine Crick and I
40:50
love Jesus and she has she has taught me and
40:55
equipped me to fall in love with Jesus again. It's all about Jesus.
41:02
All about Jesus.
41:10
Yeah. So, um you have heard everything about our marriage. Uh my wonderful
41:16
wife, she has been healed and uh
41:23
we have been freed from religion. Yeah. All right.
41:30
No more religion. Hallelujah. Yeah. So
41:36
[Applause] yeah very it's very good and this year
41:41
is the acceptance year and I have got a new job. Hallelujah.
41:47
Yeah. Yes. So
41:53
the path you're going with Jesus, it's not straight and it's a little bit
42:00
slippery sometimes, but you know Jesus is with you. Holy Spirit is with you.
42:08
So uh thank you Jesus for our wonderful and abundant life we are living.
42:14
Hallelujah. [Applause] Hey guys, I'm back again but in a
42:21
English version. It was so so on my heart to share my testimony in Swedish
42:27
because uh this is my home country. Praise God. But we have so many people
42:32
watching online from all over the world and it's a blessing to share the
42:38
testimony for all people to hear. Praise God. So I was in the world four years
42:44
ago and I was deeply depressed. I had voices in my head. I was seeking I was
42:50
going to therapy. I was seeking in new age and I was trying different psychedelic drugs to find God. I opened
42:58
a lot of doors to the enemy because I was totally tricked that I would find peace and freedom this way. But little
43:05
did I know I got more and more bondage by doing all this because the enemy was
43:10
tricking me. So one day I was invited to a church and mind you I don't have a Christian background. I was just
43:17
completely in the world and I went to the church because I really needed help and I tried everything and I heard about
43:23
this Jesus and I thought maybe I can get help. So as I went there, a pastor laid
43:31
a hand on me and prayed for me that everything that's not of God should leave this body. And I felt something
43:36
come up out of my stomach and I started screaming and this depression just totally left me. And hallelujah.
43:44
Hallelujah. Because therapy couldn't help me but the power of God did. But after this I I
43:52
started following Jesus with everything I had. But I was hearing these voices and lies in my mind of condemnation that
43:59
I wasn't good enough and that I needed to do more to deserve his love and everything. And so I started praying
44:05
really hard and fasting really hard and all these spiritual practices there are really good. But when it comes from
44:11
performance, it just totally put me way away from Jesus because I didn't feel
44:18
his grace or mercy or his love. I had to like deserve it with all these works.
44:23
And so I was I was just being further and further away from Jesus until I found Apostle Katherine on YouTube and
44:31
her teachings and Jesus anointed equipping through her equipping me how
44:36
to be a soldier in Christ and how to fight the spiritual battle, how to actually have authority and that I can
44:44
reject the lies and things that comes in my mind that is not the truth. And I
44:49
didn't know this, but as I started to put this to practice, I saw more and more freedom. Praise God.
44:58
Hallelujah. So, I started following the teachings more and I went to the church in LA uh
45:04
about three times and I've been to Berlin and London and I've seen God move so mightily and do wonders and miracles
45:12
and through this ministry he has healed me from PTSD and all the trauma
45:18
traumatic wounds I had from my childhood. I'm freed and digestive issues. And there's so much God has done
45:26
in my life. And I'm so grateful that he has sent his anointed vessel to touch
45:32
and bless this nation today because this is straight from the Holy Spirit.
45:39
Hallelujah. Praise Jesus.
45:47
Glory to God. Uh if anyone is a weak and foolish thing that God is has chosen or
45:54
I don't know it's me. Uh I would not choose to be up here or anything but I
45:59
have a story. I have a testimony of what God has done in my life. I found 5F church back in 2021 when I was really
46:06
struggling with my mental health. Um I was having a lot of anxiety, tormenting thoughts of fear and I was really
46:13
struggling. I was trying to go to school and study, but I was literally hindered. Like these thoughts would take over me.
46:20
And I didn't understand why. And I grew up Christian and I always sought God. Like I always was so hungry and
46:27
desperate for deliverance all my life. I was like, "God, I don't understand why why this is happening to me and why I'm
46:33
suffering so bad." Like I didn't understand, but I felt like I was just talking to God, but I felt like he
46:39
didn't answer me. But in 2021, I started seeking him with all of my heart. And as it says in the
46:45
Bible, when you seek God with all of your heart, you'll find him. And as I just put everything I had, you know,
46:51
when you're young, you have so many ambitions. I just pushed those to the side and I said, "Jesus, I want I need
46:57
you. I need you with 100% of my heart. 100% of my attention is on you." And
47:03
that's when I found Apostle Katherine on YouTube. That was God giving me that video. And as I did and as I started to
47:09
listen to her teachings, I began being transformed and I realized like as she was speaking, I was like, "Wow, I can
47:15
actually understand what she's saying." Because I used to never understand what pastors were talking about. It felt like
47:20
it was over my head. Like I never understood like what they were saying, but this was like simple. And yeah,
47:28
glory to God. And if it just hit my spirits and it it was like that spiritual food that I had been starving
47:35
for my whole life. I was starting to get through Apostle Katherine through 5F church and God spoke very very quickly
47:41
like this is your church. I want you to be planted here for life and I obeyed him because I saw the transformation in
47:47
my life and as I planted myself as I stayed obedient to God. Um the
47:53
tormenting thoughts of fear left me, the panic attacks left me. I started walking
47:59
in authority over the devil. Like it's the best life. This is amazing. like
48:06
from being so shy and so withdrawn. I used to be bullied and beat up by the
48:11
devil every single day of my life. Just to share an example, when I was in school, I was terrified of getting vaccinated. So every day in school in
48:18
like um yeah 12 years, every single day when I was in school, I would sit in
48:24
fear and every time somebody walked in the door, I was terrified that it was the nurse telling it was time to get
48:29
vaccinated every single day in school. So and it just grew. It was so many
48:35
different bondages. I'm completely free from all of that. After I planted myself at Five Church, after I found Apostle
48:40
Katherine, she's my spiritual mother. She's a true vessel of God because this is such amazing fruit that I've seen in
48:47
my life. And this is just a part like my life is flourishing. It's abundant life. My personality is flourishing. Like I
48:53
never knew. I never knew. So all glory to God. This is Jesus. If you're
48:58
doubting, this is Jesus. Revivalist now Sweden. It's my greatest honor to introduce Apostle Katherine. Hallelujah.

54:22

54:29
Let's say it on three. Revival is now Sweden. One, two, three. Revival is now
54:34
Sweden. Yes. Hallelujah.
54:41
Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Well, this is a true word that revival
54:47
is now. This is not just a fun uh slogan or something. This is a true prophetic
54:53
word of God that was once just a prophecy. I shouldn't say just, but it was once a powerful prophecy.
55:01
And as that prophecy was believed in, was stewarded, was kept alive, the flame
55:07
was kept alive, that prophecy came to pass and revival spread has spread
55:15
across the world. This is evidence of it right here. All of you, 20 nations who had traveled to be here today, I know we
55:23
missed Greece. Revival is now Greece. I saw I saw Yes. I saw him yesterday. I
55:30
saw I saw people from Denmark. I saw people from Austria. I saw people from Denmark while I was in Stockholm. And
55:36
God spoke to me. You see, this is a prophetic sign that revival has spread all over Europe and will continue to
55:43
spread like wildfire like never before because of what God is doing here today.
55:51
Hallelujah. I'm excited for what God's going to do today. I feel the excitement and joy
56:00
that God has for what he's going to do today and for how you all your life will
56:05
be changed and this city and nation will change forever after what God does
56:10
today. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I feel the fire of the Holy Spirit. Thank you, Holy Spirit. Thank
56:17
you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. He is here. His presence is here. His anointing is here.
56:23
Revival is now is a true word. It is really happening now.
56:30
These testimonies that we heard from all of the 5F church family in Sweden, my
56:35
spiritual sons and daughters in Sweden, how powerful. Amen. Praise God.
56:42
And I I'm so proud of you, my spiritual sons and daughters from Sweden. I'm so
56:47
proud of you. God is so proud of you. Thank you on
56:53
behalf of God's kingdom for carrying this revival fire to your nation. Hallelujah.
56:59
These testimonies that you heard, these are not rare in this revival.
57:04
I have seen testimony after testimony every day. There's not a day that goes
57:09
by where I don't see a testimony of God doing shocking miracles, healing people
57:15
of all types of ailments and diseases, delivering people from all kinds of oppression from all over the world. We
57:22
have people planted from 162 nations at F-fold church, meaning they are members
57:27
of fivefold church from 162 nations. And I am seeing God do these mighty miracles
57:33
in people literally across the world. Glory to God. every day. Even one woman
57:40
shared recently there was more than 110 different kinds of sicknesses and oppressions that she had that Jesus
57:47
delivered her and healed her of all of them. Jesus,
57:52
this is truly revival. We are living in the greatest days. We
57:59
are living in the greatest days truly because it is the days that we have
58:05
prayed for, our parents have prayed for, our grandparents have prayed for, etc. Revival, it is truly here. Maybe not
58:13
everyone sees it, but as it doesn't change the fact that it is truly here
58:18
and now, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
58:24
God has decided that this time in our generation, he would bring his revival.
58:31
He would restore what has been lost. What has been lost that we saw in the
58:37
book of Acts, that we saw in the church, in the book of Acts, the original church. These things we are, we've been
58:44
missing in the body of Christ, such as the anointing.
58:49
The anointed is the power of God that God puts in a vessel that he puts in
58:54
vessels of his choosing. Now, every single believer is given the
59:00
Holy Spirit when they give their lives to Jesus.
59:05
But there are greater measures of the Holy Spirit to be had. When you seek the
59:11
Lord with all your heart, then you will find him. The Bible says, "So some
59:17
people are seeking God partially with part of their heart and they are receiving a measure of him, a measure of
59:26
the Holy Spirit. But to find all of God, the fullness of God, the fullness of the
59:33
Holy Spirit, the measure of the Holy Spirit that he intends you to have in your life, you need to seek him with all
59:40
of your heart. You need to surrender everything to him. This is a true
59:45
principle. It is a it is a simple principle to access the anointing of
59:51
God. Many people are missing the anointing. The anointing has been lost by enlarge. The anointing is a greater
59:58
measure of the Holy Spirit. Specifically, the Holy Spirit coming upon a person's life to walk in God's
1:00:05
power, to do miracles, to release healing and cast out demons.
1:00:13
That's what the anointing is. That's what we see Elijah walking in doing signs and wonders and miracles. He had
1:00:19
the anointing. His mantel came upon his spiritual son Elisha. And he was doing
1:00:24
the same miracles. Receive a double portion. This anointing that I'm talking about is what we see in Moses. He was
1:00:30
doing signs, wonders, and miracles because he was carrying the anointing. That anointing then came upon his
1:00:35
spiritual son Joshua. And we see him doing miracles as well. We see this same
1:00:40
anointing in Apostle Paul. The Bible says Acts 19:11, God was doing
1:00:46
extraordinary miracles through the hands of Apostle Paul. There was a great
1:00:52
measure, a great level of anointing in Paul. This is the anointing we see moving through Paul, through Peter,
1:00:58
through the disciples, the five-fold ministers in the book of Acts. And that anointing would come upon their
1:01:03
spiritual children just like Timothy. But we see Jesus saying to the disciples
1:01:09
when they first cast out demons for the first time, they are amazed that they
1:01:15
are doing the miracles that Jesus was doing by Jesus's power. And Jesus says
1:01:22
he pray he he he says, "I have given you all authority.
1:01:28
I have given you all authority." Luke 10:19, "Behold, I have given you
1:01:34
authority to the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by
1:01:42
any means hurt you. So he's saying the reason why the demons are obeying you is because I have given you the authority.
1:01:52
Now he says this to his disciples. He does not say this for every single
1:01:58
believer. He then goes on to say right after he says this, he praises the father and he
1:02:04
says, "Thank you, father, for hiding these things, the revelation of your authority." One translation says,
1:02:10
"Hiding these things from those who are wise and proud and only revealing it to the humble and childlike."
1:02:17
So it reveals right there, you can be a Christian who is not humble and these
1:02:23
things will not be revealed to you. The authority to cast out demons to heal the
1:02:28
sick will not be given to you if you are proud, if you are wise in your own eyes
1:02:36
and not humble. So I just share this briefly so you can understand how the anointing has been
1:02:43
missing. How people have been missing the anointing. How many people have not humbled themselves so that God can open
1:02:50
up their eyes to see how to access the anointing? the mysteries of the spiritual realm, the secrets of the
1:02:56
spiritual realm, and that that they would be able to be trustworthy. God
1:03:01
could see them as trustworthy to pour the anointing upon them. So, so and and
1:03:07
then what you have is time has had gone by and then you have people with good
1:03:12
hearts, but they don't have direction. They don't have proper revelation, new wine revelation of the word of God about
1:03:19
anointing. They never even hear about anointing being preached in the church. They never see demons being cast out in
1:03:25
the church. So, how are they supposed to know how to receive anointing? So, so, so what has happened is there
1:03:32
has been just darkness in the body of Christ, a a measure of darkness of not
1:03:38
knowing how to access what's been missing or even see that there's
1:03:44
something missing. And so there was a need for revival and many people were
1:03:51
praying for revival, you know, just in their own mind, their own vision of
1:03:58
revival. But many people didn't even know what exactly was missing. Many didn't realize
1:04:04
we also need the five-fold ministry to equip the believers to be true
1:04:11
disciples so that their spiritual eyes may open up. And we need ful ministers
1:04:16
like apostles and prophets to carry the anointing to impart to the believers.
1:04:21
But many people didn't even realize this. So in their mind, they're praying for revival, not knowing what God's
1:04:28
revival really looks like. But God answered the prayers. God has answered your prayers. God has answered many
1:04:33
people's prayers, but many people don't realize it because it's not the revival that they were praying for. But it's
1:04:40
better. It's better. It's better than what people have been imagining revival
1:04:46
to look like, what God is bringing, what he has brought. Now, many people, they
1:04:52
didn't even know that the the the the capacity of what God could do. They
1:04:57
didn't know these great miracles like we heard on share shared on the stage just
1:05:02
a little bit ago. Many people don't know that God is capable of this right now.
1:05:09
Many people have lowered the standard and they're just wanting people to be saved, but not not knowing that God
1:05:16
wants to save people here on this earth right now from the devil's bondage. Not
1:05:22
only save them from hell when they die, but save them from hell right now.
1:05:27
And so I say this revival is far greater than what many people, what many of you
1:05:33
maybe have even been praying for revival, not even knowing it's here. And it's greater than what you were even
1:05:40
imagining. And I speak this with all of my heart because I'm living this. I'm seeing this. I'm seeing this revival
1:05:47
every day. I'm seeing people's lives being risen from the dead, come alive
1:05:54
spiritually and physically. In some cases, I'm seeing people be filled with peace and joy and abundant life and find
1:06:02
true intimacy with Jesus for the first time in their lives as they've at last been freed from the devil's grip that
1:06:10
kept them stuck, that kept them in darkness, that kept them from not being able to move forward and be walking in
1:06:16
their calling. I'm telling you, revival is now. Hallelujah. And it's time to
1:06:22
step into it. Hallelujah.
1:06:28
Isaiah 10:27, it says that the yoke shall be destroyed because of the
1:06:34
anointing. So today, the reason why, you know, you heard these testimonies just a little
1:06:40
bit ago on the stage of these testimonies and miracles happening is because of the anointing.
1:06:46
It's because the anointing was present. The anointing is Jesus himself, but it's
1:06:51
Jesus specifically moving in power. Not just Jesus being spoken about,
1:06:58
but this this Jesus in his fullness, Jesus coming in power.
1:07:03
And there's a principle in the Bible of how to receive the anointing. And that is to position yourself where the
1:07:11
anointing is being released. God chooses to use vessels.
1:07:16
every instance of miracles taking place in the Bible, these miracles are happening through vessels.
1:07:24
Read the Bible and you'll see from Old Testament to New Testament. Amen.
1:07:29
And so there's a there's a scripture where there's a story in the Bible where Apostle Peter, it says that they brought
1:07:36
the sick and demon oppressed where he was ministering under his
1:07:41
shadow. And it says that all demons left, all were healed as they came under
1:07:49
his shadow. This is New Testament. This is teaching us how to receive miracles.
1:07:55
This is teaching us God's way, main way of releasing miracles to his people.
1:08:02
So God wants to heal and deliver everyone who would come to him. But you have to come to him. You have to come to
1:08:08
him in his way. He doesn't force himself. and he will not be manipulated.
1:08:14
You have to align yourself with his principles of how he moves in power. This is what you all have done here
1:08:19
today. You've positioned yourself under the shadow of anointing.
1:08:25
You position yourself where the anointing will hit you and touch you. And it already is right now. The
1:08:31
anointing is here in this place. Some of you are already feeling and sensing the anointing on you.
1:08:38
And some of you may not even feel anything physical. Victor shared how he wasn't even a
1:08:44
believer and he came to a revival is now event. That was the action of seeking God. God saw in the spiritual realm. He
1:08:51
positioned himself under the anointing and that was it. That was all that was needed. He had to get wet by the
1:08:57
anointing by the waterfall coming upon him. He had to be touched. But he didn't
1:09:02
feel anything physical. Even immediately after he left the event, he didn't see anything different.
1:09:10
But he was changed forever. He was delivered. The ano, he was drenched by the anointing in the spiritual realm.
1:09:18
These are spiritual things, miracles that are taking place. So sometimes you don't feel anything physically. May you
1:09:25
all lift your faith so that you can receive all that God has for you. Amen.
1:09:31
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
1:09:38
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:09:49
I am so full of excitement and joy
1:09:55
for all of you here for this nation because of what God has revealed to me.
1:10:02
Even something today, this morning that he revealed to me
1:10:09
This is a prophetic word for you here in Sweden. All of you in Sweden.
1:10:16
You in Sweden in past generations, you you have experienced days of revival.
1:10:25
Revival has been here in Sweden in the past, but over time it has grown cold.
1:10:34
But now God is bringing revival, days of revival
1:10:41
back to Sweden.
1:10:46
The time is now for revival in Sweden.
1:10:51
This is the word of the Lord, Sweden. It is time for the days of revival to
1:10:58
come back to this land. And this revival will be far greater
1:11:05
than the revival experienced in the past.
1:11:10
This anointing that God is releasing is so powerful. Is extraordinary like the
1:11:18
anointing that Paul was walking in. Acts 19:11. This is extraordinary anointing.
1:11:24
And there are going to be extraordinary amounts of people saved, healed,
1:11:29
delivered, came to life and set on fire for Jesus.
1:11:36
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:11:44
It says in Hagi 2:9, "The future glory of this
1:11:49
temple will be greater than his past glory, says the Lord of heaven's armies.
1:11:55
And in this place, I will bring peace. I, the Lord of heaven armies, have spoken." God has spoken this word to you
1:12:02
Sweden right now. He is speaking this to you right now. The future glory of this
1:12:07
nation of this revival revival in this nation will be greater than its past
1:12:13
glory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:12:20
Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. There's a great wave of revival
1:12:27
coming to Sweden. It is here now. It is here now. And it is going to grow and
1:12:33
continue to grow and continue to grow. And you will be amazed. You will be shocked. This nation will be shocked.
1:12:38
The world will be shocked of what God is doing in Sweden.
1:12:46
The nation of Sweden is a chosen nation for revival
1:12:51
right now. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:12:56
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Praise God. Acts 21:17, "In the last
1:13:04
days, God says, I will pour out my spirit upon all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy. Your young men
1:13:10
will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams." These are the days right now. The the
1:13:16
the the the la the latter days. These are the days right now where God is pouring out his spirit, his anointing,
1:13:24
and it's time for miracle upon miracle upon this land for people and salvation
1:13:30
upon salvation. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. And there
1:13:37
is nothing, there is no person, there is no force of darkness that can stop this
1:13:44
revival in Sweden. Nothing. Nothing. The I I I'm telling
1:13:53
you, I know with all of my heart that this is the word of God, that it is time
1:13:59
for revival in Sweden. Th with all of my heart, this is what
1:14:06
God has spoken. And when it's God's timing, when it's God's timing for him to move, for him to bring revival in a
1:14:14
nation, nothing can stop it. Absolutely nothing. Nothing will ever stop this
1:14:20
revival. It doesn't matter how angry the devil is. It doesn't matter what people
1:14:26
try to do to stop it. Nothing will stop this move. Nothing will hinder this move
1:14:31
of God. God has decided to move now for the people of Sweden. Hallelujah.
1:14:41
Thank you, Jesus. Romans 8:31. What then shall we say of
1:14:47
these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?
1:14:53
Romans 8:31 Amplified Version. What shall we say to all these things? If God is for us, who can be successful against
1:15:01
us? Who? Absolutely nobody. I love this scripture
1:15:07
how it says, who like this is a joke. This is so silly to think that anyone
1:15:13
could be against you, could could be successful coming against you when God is on your side.
1:15:21
Hallelujah. And this is the word of the Lord for this nation and for your life,
1:15:27
for you as revival carriers that God is with you as you stand with him in his
1:15:33
move in revival and nobody can be successful against you.
1:15:40
I can shout on the rooftops of the faithfulness of God to stand with his
1:15:47
servants. I can shout on the rooftops about the
1:15:53
power, the mighty power of our God to bring victory after victory for his
1:15:59
servants, for his people.
1:16:04
I have seen my God, our God Jesus Christ, come through and defeat every
1:16:12
battle, many battles that have come against me, that have come against revival, that have come against revival
1:16:17
in LA, that have come against revival in America, that have come against revival in Europe, that have come against revival all over the world. I have seen
1:16:25
my God come through every time and bring victory.
1:16:32
I I've seen Hallelujah. It's been eight years that I have been
1:16:41
carrying this revival fire. At first, for four and a half years, it was just a prophecy. I should not say it was just
1:16:48
it was a powerful prophecy. Hallelujah. For four and a half years. And I saw
1:16:53
even when it hadn't even revival hadn't broken out yet, I saw the devil attack
1:16:58
me like I never seen in my entire life. And I was a believer my whole life. But when I stepped in this revival, when I
1:17:06
started walking in the anointing, I saw the devil manifest work through people
1:17:11
like I had never seen in my life. I saw people do evil things towards me for no reason. People hate me for no reason.
1:17:19
Like I've never seen in my life. I've seen people make up lies and spread
1:17:25
them, bring false accusations, and people believe them. And our church of 20 people shrink down to 15 and then the
1:17:33
next year shrink down to 10 and the next year shrink down to five and then to two over the course of four and a half
1:17:38
years. Then COVID hit. The Bible says no weapon forms against you shall prosper. But that it it
1:17:46
doesn't say that the weapon won't form against you. Weapons will still form against you, but
1:17:51
they won't prosper. So, hallelujah.
1:17:57
Weapons look really scary when you think there's a chance they will prosper. But when you look at the weapon in the eye
1:18:03
and you know with all your heart that it will not prosper, that it must return back to where it was sent and not harm
1:18:11
you even one bit. Then you can stand with peace, with boldness, with
1:18:16
confidence and look at that weapon in the eye and say, "If God is for me, who
1:18:22
can be against me? I resist you, Satan. Get behind me,
1:18:27
Satan. I reject this lie and I put my eyes on
1:18:34
Jesus and I stay focused on my Jesus and I stay focused on the work he has called me to do." Those weapons will then
1:18:41
leave. Resist the devil and he must flee. Resist the devil and he must flee. Resist those weapons, those lies and
1:18:48
they must turn back away from you. Hallelujah. So I saw the enemy try to bring, you
1:18:54
know, when that when the church was getting smaller, it was not the devil succeeding. It was not the weapons prospering
1:19:01
in those moments. That was the best thing that could happen to me because I needed refining fire. I needed testing.
1:19:08
I needed that trial that would refine my heart to be more like Jesus to build
1:19:13
strength in me, to build faith, to build the character of Christ. I needed that. I needed that. That was the best thing
1:19:19
that could happen to me. Just like Joseph needed that refining fire when
1:19:24
his brothers threw him in a pit and he was falsely accused and thrown into prison. Just like David, God knew he
1:19:31
needed that refining fire when Saul was allowed to falsely accuse him and attack
1:19:36
him and try to kill him. This refining fire is what we need to be
1:19:43
able to be these giants of faith that God has called us to be. to be leaders in his revival, to be true disciples
1:19:49
that are mature and not weak and babies, but ones that can make disciples of the nations and help others and lead the way
1:19:57
and encourage them and say, "God is faithful. Keep going. Keep believing."
1:20:03
You you cannot do that without life experience. You can't encourage people at least
1:20:10
powerfully without that experience that of God's faithfulness in your life which
1:20:16
comes through the refining fire your faith being tested and you see God show up again and again and again.
1:20:22
Hallelujah. And so after those four and a half years
1:20:28
of this this refining fire that I went through and seeing even the enemy so
1:20:34
terrified of the anointing before even revival broke out, trying to stop the work of God, trying to intimidate me,
1:20:39
try to cause fear in me and and doubt, intimidation.
1:20:45
The devil was defeated. As I kept my eyes on Jesus, as I kept staying focused
1:20:50
on him and focused on the work of God, in God's perfect timing, he brought us
1:20:55
into the promised land of revival. The walls of Jericho came down in God's perfect timing. Hallelujah. And now, in
1:21:04
just four years later, revival has spread across the whole world. Hallelujah.
1:21:13
And And through those four through those four years since the revival broke out
1:21:19
in 2021, I've seen the devil come in even more
1:21:25
evil ways than I did be the first four years of the the refining fire. I saw
1:21:31
him come in evil ways to try to stop the work of God, to try to intimidate me, to try to get me to give up, uh just to try
1:21:39
to sway me in any way. I saw the devil come in ways I couldn't dream he could be this evil. I couldn't dream that
1:21:46
people could be this evil. But every time the devil was defeated,
1:21:51
every time light conquered darkness, it overcame every time. Every time God
1:21:59
stood by me, he stood by his move and he brought victory.
1:22:04
There hasn't been a day, there hasn't been a year where I haven't seen there be victory in God's revival.
1:22:12
There hasn't been an attack from the devil that I haven't seen God turn around
1:22:18
for the good of the body of Christ, for my good, for our good, for the revival
1:22:23
army's good. Every time he has been faithful, every time he has been victorious. And so I
1:22:30
say to you with all of my heart, if God is for you, who can be against you? I
1:22:36
say with all my heart that nothing can stop this move of God, this revival that
1:22:42
has come to Sweden and will grow like a wildfire.
1:22:49
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:22:54
If there's one thing I could tell myself years ago before going through a lot of
1:23:01
attacks from the devil, a lot of persecution, one of the things I would tell myself is
1:23:09
don't give the devil any kind of satisfaction.
1:23:15
Like don't don't let him get to you with this persecution.
1:23:21
Don't Don't let him make you cry. I'm not saying crying's bad, you know.
1:23:28
Don't. But I'm what I'm saying is like don't let the devil get to you,
1:23:34
get to your heart. He's nothing but a big fat liar.
1:23:45
And so every attack that comes towards you, every kind of persecution that comes towards you through other people,
1:23:53
every single time it's nothing but a big lie, a false accusation of you, a false
1:24:01
accusation of God, a false accusation about revival, the move of God, a false
1:24:06
accusation about the ministry you're planted at, a false accusation about the servant of God who you've been blessed
1:24:12
you've been by, you've received the power of God through.
1:24:18
Every time the enemy persecutes you, attacks you, it's nothing but a lie. A
1:24:24
lie. A lie of doubt. A a lie of a a lie to doubt God's
1:24:29
faithfulness. A lie to doubt to try to get you to doubt God's plan for your life. The prophecy spoken over your life
1:24:36
about revival. Uh, every attack of the devil is nothing
1:24:42
but a lie to to bring you insecure, to try to bring you in be insecure, to
1:24:47
intimidate you, to try to get you to to stifle your fire, to get you to slow down, to try to get you to second guess
1:24:54
and be confused. Lie, lie, lie. Nothing but lies.
1:25:02
And so I've had some days where where I was crying because of the attack of the
1:25:08
devil because it hurt. But looking back, it did not need to hurt.
1:25:14
I did not need to to let it hurt so bad because what the devil meant for harm,
1:25:20
God used for my good.
1:25:28
Every time sometimes there was something I wanted. There was like one time it was
1:25:33
like a a like a a church like a a place where we were going to have an event
1:25:38
have services and I thought God has released this. It
1:25:44
got taken away because of the because of the enemy seems an enemy but then what
1:25:49
God gave was so much better
1:25:54
was so much better. And so I thank God now for the thing that I was sad about
1:26:01
missing. I think you you see I have so many examples in my own life where I seen the
1:26:08
devil wanted to just get to my heart. This is what I would tell myself.
1:26:14
Don't ever let him get to you. Make this decision to never let him get in your
1:26:20
mind, get in your heart, because God sees everything. He will never let
1:26:26
weapons formed against you to prosper. So, if you're feeling defeated, you're
1:26:31
believing a lie. If you're seeing Goliath and you think the the battle's over, you're believing
1:26:39
a lie.
1:26:44
And you will come against Goliaths. I've seen this move of God come against
1:26:49
Goliaths and I've seen God bring victory every time. God will bring you victory
1:26:54
every time. every time you face a Goliath. And the the fact of the matter was that
1:27:00
that battle of David against Goliath
1:27:06
with God on his side, David was far more powerful than Goliath. So much more
1:27:12
powerful than that. Goliath could have been a million times the size of what he
1:27:17
was and he would have still been defeated.
1:27:24
David still would have won. Hallelujah.
1:27:29
That's the God we serve. That's the God we serve. Hallelujah.
1:27:36
Hallelujah. Amen. Yeah.
1:27:42
Anybody excited about our Jesus? Our mighty God. Our mighty God.
1:27:48
He's a mighty God. Hallelujah.
1:27:55
The devil is under our feet. Hallelujah.
1:28:02
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Acts 5:38. So my advice is leave these
1:28:09
men alone, these these disciples of Jesus, let them go. If they are planning and doing things merely on their own, it
1:28:15
will soon be overthrown. But if but if it is from God, if this revival that
1:28:21
they're speaking of, this the power this power that's moving through them and doing miracles. If it is from God, you
1:28:29
will not be able to overthrow them. You will not. You may even find
1:28:36
yourselves fighting against God.
1:28:41
The Bible gives us so much proof that we have the victory
1:28:48
every single time when God is on our side.
1:28:55
So this is a peaceful, relaxing, amazing life we get to live with Jesus. If you
1:29:01
can just open your eyes, allow your spiritual eyes to open to see how
1:29:08
faithful God is and how mighty God is. And if you you all need to your eyes
1:29:17
need to open up more. And I'm praying I I'm praying this over all of you today
1:29:22
that your spiritual eyes will open up more to grasp
1:29:27
the bigness the the the the size of this revival how huge this anointing this power of
1:29:35
God is that is here moving in this place and that has come upon many of you
1:29:40
already and you're walking in it. There's impartation testimonies we've heard from our here in Sweden and that
1:29:47
will come upon you here today. Impartation of anointing.
1:29:54
The devil hates The devil hates revival and he hates the anointing more than
1:30:01
anything. If you He He cannot stand the anointing
1:30:07
because it's the anointing that destroys his kingdom. When people preach nice sermons, but they don't carry the
1:30:15
authority over demons and they don't carry the anointing and they don't cast
1:30:20
out demons. The devil is not afraid.
1:30:26
He sees a bunch of believers believing in Jesus but staying stuck in bondage. He can still control them in some
1:30:32
aspects of their life through this bondage. And he can control how much they shine. They can't shine to their
1:30:38
fullness because they are in bondage. So this is why I say what the devil
1:30:44
hates more than anything is the anointing. Is true disciples, true servants of God
1:30:52
who have embraced and received the anointing, the power of God,
1:30:59
God in his fullness. Because that's when the devil loses.
1:31:04
That's when he can't control believers in any way anymore. That's when he is completely defeated in that believer's
1:31:11
life. He doesn't want you to have total victory over him. You have to open up your eyes to see this truth. You have to
1:31:18
understand why you are experiencing persecution when you seek Jesus more.
1:31:24
When you embrace his anointing, then you find persecution. Of course.
1:31:31
and and and the devil's number one way to try to stop you from receiving the
1:31:36
anointing, from receiving deliverance, from receiving impartation, walking in abundant life, the number one way he'll
1:31:42
try to stop you is the same way he tried to stop Jesus and the his disciples in
1:31:48
the Bible, which was which was through religious people,
1:31:54
through believers of God, Pharisees,
1:32:04
Jesus was persecuted and crucified because of the devil moving through the
1:32:10
Pharisees. This is that's this is the ultimate by the way God uses everything what the
1:32:17
devil meant for evil for good. This is why God allowed all that
1:32:23
persecution, all of that led to even crucifixion because Jesus needed to be
1:32:28
crucified to be the sacrifice of for us. Amen.
1:32:35
But hallelujah. But in the Bible,
1:32:41
when we're seeing persecution come towards Jesus, towards the disciples,
1:32:47
it was always through religious people. people who thought they knew the word of
1:32:53
God. People who thought they knew the things of God, the heart of God, but
1:32:58
they were so wrong. They were prideful and they missed
1:33:04
Jesus. They missed revival. Because when you're humble and
1:33:10
childlike, remember as I shared earlier, Jesus said, that is when your spiritual eyes will open up and God can reveal the
1:33:18
secrets of the spiritual realm. So people will miss revival. They will
1:33:24
miss Jesus if they do not humble themselves 100%.
1:33:30
You have to humble yourself for your eyes to open up for you to
1:33:35
recognize Jesus. The Bible says that he moves and through weak and foolish things, he does a new thing.
1:33:43
And so, you have to be humble to recognize Jesus moving in a way that's going to be
1:33:50
beyond what you expected, beyond your understanding and human knowledge.
1:33:56
You need to see in the spirit. Amen. And so
1:34:03
and so I I God wants to empower you to stand strong against persecution.
1:34:12
For many of you, persecution is new. I never encountered persecution until I walked in my calling and carried the
1:34:18
anointing. And then I experienced the Bible coming alive, persecution.
1:34:25
But now I've learned that it is such a great encouragement and motivation
1:34:31
to see biblical level persecution
1:34:37
because the Bible says blessed are you when you are persecuted. The Bible says that if you if they hate
1:34:44
you, Jesus says they hated me. So don't worry about it. Of course
1:34:50
you're going to be hated. Of course you're going to be persecuted. To be persecuted is a sign that the
1:34:57
devil is terrified of you and you are doing powerful things for Jesus.
1:35:04
And hallelujah.
1:35:11
And God is truly using you powerfully to bring salvation, healing, deliverance,
1:35:17
and releasing the fire of God upon people. If you're experiencing persecution, you
1:35:23
can know that that is taking place, that God is using you powerfully.
1:35:28
Hallelujah. In fact, if you're not finding persecution, that's actually a sign that
1:35:34
you are not a threat to the devil. So, I want to encourage you, get used to
1:35:40
the new normal. Get used to the Bible coming alive.
1:35:46
I would say for better or worse, but it's really just for better. Because remember, whatever the devil
1:35:52
intends for evil, God uses for good. Hallelujah.
1:35:59
Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Jesus.
1:36:07
It's taken time, but I've learned to to to to tune out the noise of the devil.
1:36:17
No, the biggest noise of the devil in my life that the he tries to bring is
1:36:23
through Pharisees of today. But I've learned through time that the
1:36:30
best thing I can do, the most pleasing thing I can do for God is to please God,
1:36:36
is to make the choice to tune out the noise, keep my eyes on Jesus, and stay
1:36:43
focused on loving his people. There are so many more for us than against us.
1:36:50
There are so many for us than against us. And the devil, he likes to make a
1:36:56
loud ruckus. A large ruckus. A large ruckus. A large noise.
1:37:04
But really, there are more for us than against us. It it is just like when the
1:37:11
servant of Elisha was so terrified when he saw this massive army against coming against Elijah and everyone with Elijah
1:37:19
and sec 2 Kings 6:17 it says and Elisha prayed open his eyes Lord so that he may
1:37:25
see. Then the Lord opened the servant's eyes and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all
1:37:33
around Elisha. So his eyes opened up and he could see a massive angel army
1:37:40
all around Elisha that was so much bigger, so much
1:37:46
more powerful than the physical army that was coming against them.
1:37:52
And this is how it is in the spiritual realm. You got to be prepared for this. That through persecution the devil will
1:37:59
will will try to intimidate, look like Goliath, look scary, but he's nothing.
1:38:06
He is nothing. He is defeated. And there are always more for us than against us.
1:38:12
The angel army and the revival army. You've got you've got brothers and
1:38:19
sisters in this revival army. Fellow warriors of God in the revival army around the world in 162 nations.
1:38:29
That's a massive army that you're a part of that you are united with.
1:38:36
Not to mention the angel army. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus.
1:38:44
So in Isaiah 60 verse1 it says arise shine for your light has come and the glory of the Lord rises upon you. See
1:38:50
darkness covers the earth and thick darkness is over the peoples but the Lord rises upon you and his glory
1:38:56
appears over you. Nations will come to your light and kings to the brightness of your dawn.
1:39:02
This year prophetically is the year of the Lord's acceptance. It's the year of the Lord's favor. the year where God has
1:39:10
been preparing hearts to receive him and the harvest is ripe and people will come
1:39:16
and accept Jesus like you haven't seen before in the past. So prophetically the
1:39:21
direction for all of you for the revival army is to shine your lights so that the
1:39:28
people in the darkness can see that the light of Jesus is here. the light of
1:39:33
revival has come and that Jesus is the answer to all of
1:39:39
their problems. That healing and deliverance and salvation is available
1:39:44
for them. God will use you so powerfully as you shine your light. Hallelujah.
1:39:52
So this is a prophetic word for all of you in Sweden. It is time right now to
1:39:58
unite together with this big revival army that is here on this earth to unite
1:40:05
together all of you in Sweden. We have a 5F church small group in Sweden. I met
1:40:11
with them earlier today who's who are on fire for Jesus. The
1:40:17
leaders of the small group, you heard their testimony earlier today.
1:40:23
unite with them to carry this revival fire to your
1:40:28
nation because we are stronger together. And this is God's principle that we work
1:40:35
together as a body. This is how we kindle the flame that's been put in us
1:40:41
is by uniting together with our family in Christ. This is how you will stay
1:40:47
strong. This is how you'll be reminded of God's faithfulness when you need it.
1:40:54
Is how God can entrust you with more responsibility
1:41:00
for in his kingdom with more anointing is when you get in line with God's ways.
1:41:07
One of his ways, one of his principles is to unite together as a family in
1:41:13
Christ. One of his principles is to be planted in a church, not just any church, a
1:41:21
church that God has truly anointed, where really his power is moving.
1:41:26
That is where you'll actually be equipped spiritually to have victory over the devil. That is where yolks will
1:41:33
be destroyed off your life. That is where you will have a spiritual protection where no witches or anybody
1:41:39
can send curses on you or anything like that because you are getting in line with God's way of releasing spiritual
1:41:46
protection. That is where you will receive impartation of anointing because
1:41:52
you have planted yourself like Elisha planted himself under Elijah like Timothy planted himself under Apostle
1:41:58
Paul. Hallelujah. So God is calling every one of you to be planted in a
1:42:04
church where God's power is moving. He's called you to be planted in one
1:42:10
church. Hallelujah. So it is where he will be moving and it is where he is specifically calling you.
1:42:18
And I invite you all to join the 5F church family. I invite you all to plant yourself at Five-fold Church and be a
1:42:25
part of this revival and come and receive this impartation of anointing.
1:42:31
Amen. To be planted in a church, you don't have to be in the physical. You don't
1:42:36
have to be physically there. Especially in this season, in this season that we are in in revival where God is laying
1:42:43
the foundation. There will one day be a five-fold church branch in Sweden in
1:42:49
God's perfect timing. Hallelujah. And the beginnings of it are this is the
1:42:56
five is the five-fold church small group in Sweden. This is the foundation that
1:43:02
is being laid. And so God is speaking right now. It's time to unite with this
1:43:08
revival army so I can use you mightily with this anointing.
1:43:15
Hallelujah. Victor, did you share in your testimony about impartation?
1:43:21
No. Come, if you can just briefly share your
1:43:27
testimony of impartation. Yeah. Um, so
1:43:32
I I went to um I've been to multiple events with this church and one of them
1:43:39
was in Berlin where Apostle Katherine prayed for me and uh I received the
1:43:45
impartation of anointing and after that I met two people who just
1:43:52
had become Christians in the other church that I was going to still a little bit in Sweden. And uh they had
1:44:00
two different issues. um their neighbors were Satanists basically and were
1:44:07
attacking them spiritually. And so the man in that family, he experienced as if
1:44:13
someone was blowing smoke in his face constantly like 24/7, especially when he
1:44:18
was trying to sleep. And how they know there was the neighbors was because they got a little note in the mailbox saying
1:44:25
that he's a coward and a picture of a man blowing smoke. And there was no smoke anywhere in the room. And this
1:44:31
went on for a long time. The people in his church prayed for him and it even
1:44:38
got worse at some point, but nothing really happened. And then uh I sensed
1:44:44
the Holy Spirit leading me to pray for him and I took him outside of the church. I just prayed very simply and
1:44:49
just commanded it to go. And then he had woken up that night and started to cough and cough and cough. And then after a
1:44:57
long time, he experienced freedom. And uh the day after it was gone and since then it was completely gone. Glory to
1:45:03
God. Glory to God. Yeah. And uh and this
1:45:08
same man he his face or his his face too as you're going to hear but his faith
1:45:14
was lift uh lifted by this of course. And he had another problem that he came
1:45:19
to me with. He had a facial nerve therefore his face that um he had had
1:45:25
problems so that he couldn't really go outside outside. If he went outside, he could be sick for like a week. If he
1:45:32
just went to the store, he would have to be indoors for like a week. And I go to pray for him. And same thing, I just
1:45:38
declared very simply healing in Jesus' name. And the day after he woke up and
1:45:44
it was much better. And he went out for a 15 kilometer walk and nothing
1:45:49
happened. And then the day after he went for another long walk, nothing happened. And I'm still friends with them today.
1:45:55
And they go for long walks all the time. and there's no problems. He's completely healed. Glory to God. Uh yeah, and the
1:46:02
people in his church had also prayed for this thing and nothing happened. But then when I prayed and I promise there's
1:46:08
nothing special about me at all, but I had received impartation. And when I
1:46:13
prayed, it just gone completely. So, uh yeah, lift your faith when it comes to
1:46:20
importation. It's real. There's been so many testimonies about it. And uh yeah,
1:46:26
that's the that's what happened. Hallelujah. So Vic Victor is from Sweden, lives in
1:46:33
Sweden, and God used him in the anointing.
1:46:39
You see, this is not just for me. This is not just for a handful of ministers
1:46:44
to walk in the anointing. Th when I say revival has come to Sweden and it is
1:46:51
going to grow so big, I don't mean just the old way. I mean
1:46:57
getting align getting in line with God's ways. I mean God is going to use you
1:47:06
like you just heard, put his anointing in you and move
1:47:12
through you. It is not for me to spearhead revival in
1:47:19
Sweden. It is for you. I release impartation to you. I equip
1:47:27
you. But it is you who is used by God to
1:47:34
carry this revival in Sweden. It is through you that so many people

this family now. And I declare every demonic spirit that's tried to hold you
2:19:52
back, that's tried to hinder you from being used by God, every spirit of lack,
2:19:57
it must go now in Jesus name.
2:20:04
I declare total freedom for this family, total freedom for baby and protection in
2:20:10
the spiritual realm. And I bless this baby. I release this anointing to this baby now and to you. And I speak peace
2:20:17
and health over you both in Jesus name. Healthy blessed deliveries in Jesus name
2:20:24
I declare for both of you and for anyone who is pregnant here. Hallelujah. Thank
2:20:30
you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah.
2:20:37
How great is our God? How great is our God? God is going to move in power right
2:20:44
now. He's already moved in power upon all of you. But he's going to move in a in a greater measure right now
2:20:52
and bring deliverance and healing to everyone who needs it. One of a big key
2:20:58
to receiving freedom is to renounce. And to renounce it means to resist the
2:21:06
devil. The ways he's been trying to bring oppression in your life. The way he has oppressed you. The portion he's
2:21:12
trying to give you is to resist it. Renounce. It also means to walk in
2:21:19
authority and claim that you are a child of God. You have an inheritance that God
2:21:25
has given you. And that inheritance is healing. By his stripes, you are healed.
2:21:31
That inheritance is healing, freedom, peace, sound mind, joy, and abundant
2:21:38
life in every area. So when you renounce, you're taking a stand against
2:21:43
the devil and you're surrendering to Jesus so that the anointing can then come upon you and deliver you. Amen. So
2:21:51
begin speaking aloud. Begin renouncing whatever the oppression is that you
2:21:57
have, whatever the sickness is. If you have sickness, pain, whatever whatever
2:22:02
yoke of the devil is on your life, speak it aloud. Renounce it. Say, "I renounce
2:22:08
depression. I renounce addiction. I renounce this sickness etc. Start speaking it right now. And everyone
2:22:15
watching online, speak right now. Renounce. God is going to come in power and touch you through the screen
2:22:24
right now. This anointing is coming upon every person here from the front to all
2:22:29
the way in the back. Lift your faith. Take all the limits off of God.
2:22:39
Lift your hands to receive right now. I detach every one of you from what you
2:22:46
have renounced, from lists of renouncing that you brought. From what you are speaking, renouncing right now. I detach
2:22:53
you now. I break every generational curse off of
2:22:59
your lives. I break every curse of witchcraft. I break every word curse. I
2:23:06
break every demonic soul tie. I cancel every demonic covenant. I cancel every
2:23:13
covenant of death and suicide. And I declare now that every spirit
2:23:22
of witchcraft, it must go from every person now in
2:23:27
Jesus name. Every spirit of death and suicide must
2:23:33

2:36:55
praising Jesus. I I speak totally totally in Jesus name.
2:37:02

2:37:09
that Jesus his his power has moved upon every person here. Hallelujah.
2:37:15
Hallelujah. Jesus has just done miracle upon miracle. right now
2:37:21

2:37:26

2:37:32
seats. Please keep praising Jesus.
2:37:38
Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus.
2:37:45
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
2:37:54
Thank you Lord.
2:38:02
Hallelujah. God, you are so good. Thank you Jesus
2:38:08
for every miracle you have done in this place. Thank you Jesus.
2:38:14
Thank you Jesus.
2:38:21
If you could be if you can make your way quietly to your seats because I want to share something with you as you're
2:38:27
making your way to your seats.
2:38:36
There are some people who felt something physically and there are others who have not.
2:38:44
But in both categories, you have received miracles.
2:38:52
God moves differently. Sometimes you feel the miracle. There's a there's a manifestation to the physical realm and
2:38:59
sometimes there's not. Sometimes you don't see the miracle manifest till days later. Like the people with leprosy,
2:39:06
they came to Jesus and the Bible says on their way, he says, "Show yourselves to the priest and the Bible says on their way they were healed." So that means
2:39:13
that in the presence of Jesus, they didn't experience uh uh they didn't see that they were physically healed yet,
2:39:20
but they were indeed healed in the spirit and it would manifest as they kept their faith and walked in
2:39:25
obedience. So God moves the same way today. It's different. It's different for everybody.
2:39:31
What's important is that you value what he has just released. You you you value
2:39:37
it by believing without seeing. That's how you actually receive the
2:39:42
miracle and not let the devil take it. So you do this by confessing, I thank
2:39:47
you, Jesus. I believe I am healed. I believe I am free. Thank you Jesus for healing me. Thank you Jesus for freeing
2:39:54
me. Amen. So say I am healed. I am I am free.
2:40:00
I am free. Thank you God. Thank you God for healing me.
2:40:06
For healing for freeing me. for doing miracles
2:40:11
for me today. Amen. That's how you receive. It's simple.
2:40:20
And you keep you keep doing that. You keep walking in that truth and that authority and that faith. And that's how
2:40:28
you see the miracle manifest. Amen. Hallelujah.
2:40:33
Well, I want to invite you all to give thanks to God right now. in action
2:40:38
through sacrifice because he's worthy of of of giving a sacrifice and a
2:40:44
thanksgiving to. He He's worthy of this. Amen. All of his miracles that he gives,
2:40:49
they are free. They are completely free. But we shouldn't treat them as free. We should treat them as valuable, as
2:40:55
costly, as precious. Amen. A big way we give thanks to God
2:41:03
is in action. The Bible says faith without works is dead. by the action of giving back to him,
2:41:09
giving back to his kingdom because it's through ministry, through the work of
2:41:14
God that the miracles take place. Amen.
2:41:20
So by giving back to the work of God, you are advancing God's kingdom more.
2:41:25
You are making it so that God can do what he has done in you for others, for more people. Amen.
2:41:34
And um I want you to know just how how
2:41:40
much God loves Sweden, how how how serious he is about his plans for revival here. How much he
2:41:47
loves all of you. This event is a 5F church event hosted
2:41:53

2:41:58
me to come minister here in Sweden to an event on here. And so we raised
2:42:08

2:43:52
Thank you. God has used you so powerfully. And we still have about 40, yes $42,000
2:44:00

2:44:06
your life and sew into this event so that we can start to raise funds for
2:44:11
future events. We are wanting to plan, God has put on on my heart to he wants
2:44:16
me to to do an event, us to do an event at FiveF Church from Five Church in
2:44:21
Paris and New Zealand and many others. And so by you giving to
2:44:28
this work of God, by to contributing to this event, we are able to then raise money to plan for future events. Amen.
2:44:37

Okay. Thank you, sis. So, we have some
2:53:36
announcements. Um, and the first one is that Apostle Katherine will be signing books out in
2:53:44
the lobby after right now. So, she'll be signing uh her two wonderful books,
2:53:51
Unlock Your Deliverance, which is the latest one, and then also The Secret of the Anointing. And uh they're also
2:53:57
available to be purchased. And this is wonderful equipping from uh Jesus Christ
2:54:02
anointed warfare equipping to overcome the enemy and how to receive more impartation and walk in the anointing.
2:54:09
So walk out there and uh she will be there shortly to uh sign your copies.
2:54:16
Hallelujah. Yes. So I will continue. We we want to remind you that we have a merch table
2:54:23
right there in the lobby. There you can buy your own copy of Apostles, both
2:54:28
books, Unlock Your Deliverance and Secret of the Anointing. And there is also some Five-Fold Church merch and
2:54:35
t-shirts and some stuff. So, grab your own stuff.
2:54:41
Thank you, Sh. And uh I'm I'm going to talk about being planted. So, one of the major spiritual
2:54:49
principles is being planted. Uh, Apostle Katherine talked a little bit about this before and I'm just going to read one
2:54:56
scripture. He's like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its
2:55:02
season and its leaves uh does not wither. In all he does, he prospers.
2:55:07
That's Psalms 13. And this talks about being planted and how when you decide to
2:55:16
be planted and stay planted, you will prosper and you will have victory and
2:55:21
you will bear fruit in every season. And it's also a key component to maintaining your deliverance. And God is calling us
2:55:28
to be planted in a church. Uh specifically, he calls us to be planted in a church that is anointed by God, not
2:55:35
anointed by man. and where the leadership is anointed by God and not anointed by man. And so God can call you
2:55:43
to different churches depending on what his calling is for you of course. Um
2:55:51
sorry if we could have everyone's attention if you want to continue talking you can do that outside but right now just if we could have
2:55:57
everyone's intention in here. Thank you. Yes. And uh this is a spiritual
2:56:03
principle. So that means it's not bound to the physical. For example, I'm
2:56:08
planted in fivefold church that is located in Los Angeles and I've seen
2:56:14
that work tremendously in my life. Hello.
2:56:23
I just I want to encourage you all to listen up because this is really important information
2:56:29
that the all of these precious 5F church members are sharing. So please, if I can have your attention, I'm not going to be
2:56:34
signing books quite yet until the announcements are finished. Okay? So please, if you can have all your ears
2:56:40
and respect, thank you. Um, and also I want to share these are these are small
2:56:46
group leaders all on the stage here from Finland. Finland
2:56:52
and Norway and Sweden and Daniel Sweden. Hallelujah.
2:56:59
Awesome. You can continue. Yes. So, I was saying being planted is a
2:57:04
spiritual principle. It's not bound to uh where you are located physically. I'm planted in 5F. It's in Los Angeles. I
2:57:11
live in southern Sweden. And it works very well. And uh how that works is the
2:57:17
anointing works prophetically. That means that what I need during the
2:57:22
week and in my life, God will give it to me. He knows what I need. It's not a man
2:57:28
that knows what I need. Uh but God knows what I need and he has again and again
2:57:34
shocked me by speaking prophetically through my leader. Uh you know I meditate on something in the week and uh
2:57:40
the devil is attacking in a certain way and then when a live stream on Wednesday for example occurs exactly what I need
2:57:48
is given to me by the Holy Spirit through my leader and that's how it's supposed to work. And so uh being
2:57:56
planted and remaining planted is a key it's a key principle to um walk in your
2:58:04
calling and be effective and uh yeah these things I shared. So if you want to
2:58:10
be planted in five-fold church, if you feel called to be planted in this church
2:58:16
uh and take this seriously, be a disciple here u learn from here, receive from here, you can scan this QR code or
2:58:24
you can go to the website and there will be a form that you can fill in and then you will receive an email and uh yeah,
2:58:32
you will be planted and uh I think that's all I want to share. Yeah. And
2:58:38
just like uh Apostle said, we are all most of us are leaders in small groups.
2:58:44
So 5F have small groups around the world. This is mainly for people that
2:58:50
are not in the LA area and want to be a part of a community and fellowship and
2:58:57
learn from apostle together, learn how to become a revival warrior together. Um
2:59:04
so these groups you can sign up. There's a QR code behind me here, so you can sign up for a small group. There's one
2:59:12
in Finland and there's one in Sweden and Norway and other countries as well. And
2:59:18
as a leader in the small group, it has been such a blessing to see how people
2:59:24
are being touched and transformed and the testimonies coming forth. So more
2:59:30
and more and more testimonies coming forth from these small groups and it's really really such a blessing to be a
2:59:36
part of this. So if you want to have fellowship together with other 5F
2:59:42
revival warriors, sign up for a small group near you. Hallelujah. Um God has moved so
2:59:50
powerfully tonight and so many have you have been set free, delivered, healed
2:59:57
and the enemy is mad about it and we have to take this deliverance, our freedom so seriously. We need to re
3:00:05
maintain our deliverance. Apostle Kathern Craig has a playlist called How
3:00:10
to Maintain Your Deliverance and you can find this from this QR code. It is very
3:00:19
serious. So access this playlist, keep your deliverance and grow.
3:00:30
And then I really encourage you to share your testimony. This is a way that you
3:00:35
can let other people know of what what you've received tonight, miracles you've received from God. It's a way that you
3:00:41
can tell other people this is available for you, too. I've received this. God did this for me. And the testimony is
3:00:47
the spirit of prophecy. It it's giving other people hope and faith that they too can receive what you have received.
3:00:53
So I encourage you to testify of what God has done tonight for you or previously watching live streams of
3:00:59
Apostle Katherine or previous revival events. Um because it's so powerful and it's how we overcome the devil by our
3:01:06
testimony and it's the fruits that overpower the lie. So this is a powerful tool that we have that we can play a
3:01:12
part in this work of God on this earth. So there's a testimony sign in that corner. So you can go there and also ask
3:01:19
the ushers where you need to where you can go to share your testimony. We have a testimony room right now where uh you
3:01:25
can go and share your testimony for God's glory. So praise God for all he's done tonight. Revival is now Sweden.
3:01:36
Hallelujah.
