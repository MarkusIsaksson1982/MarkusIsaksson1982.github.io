know that those are just the ones that are shared. So get expectant for God to touch you and also share this with your
42:11
friends and your family. Share, share, share everywhere possible. Not only does
42:18
this reach your friends and your family and people on your social media uh feeds
42:23
that need desperately need a touch from God, but also when you share this live
42:30
stream and when you interact with it, you like it, you comment, you you you you do all those things,
42:36
it makes the video reach more people. That's how it works. That's how social media works. It's called an algorithm.
42:43
So you are truly making the gospel be spread further and God's power and
42:48
revival be spread further every time you hit share. So I want to encourage you to do that today and always do that. Amen.
42:55
Also share with us where you're watching from in the comments. I want to also welcome everyone who's traveled from

44:52
things. The testimony that you you shared with the welcome table, but also
44:57
um just a brief testimony of what God's doing in the small group in the Florida small group. Oh, it's so amazing. Uh, one testimony
45:05
that I happened just uh the last week was that um I I gave them a homework to
45:13
watch one of your videos and uh one of the girls from the group said, "Oh my
45:19
God, God used you so mightily for me to watch this video because he delivered me from fear."
45:26
So, so that was amazing. So, that was amazing. And and and one thing about
45:31
that it was that the video that I chose it was the same video that the next that
45:38
uh it was Emily from Texas. She chose that same video for her group and it was
45:44
like oh my god I texted Emily and I said it's it's the spirit. It's like we're
45:49
united because you choose that video but I choose it at the same time without you
45:54
knowing. you know, out of thousands of videos videos out of thousand of videos. So,
45:59
that was so amazing. That was so amazing. We have 123 people that have
46:05
joined the Florida group. So, that's amazing. Not everybody's
46:11
showing up. It's small beginnings like you said. Uh we have people like some weeks six, some weeks 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
46:18
12, 13. Every week more people join, you know. But uh I I see that uh that
46:26
their faith is being increased by their testimony that they're hearing, you know. So it's amazing. It's really
46:31
amazing. It's praise God. Praise God. If you're in Florida, go to

46:55
Colorado starting soon. So, you can sign up for those now. Hallelujah. So amazing. So, I want to share the
47:02
miracles God has done. Um, first time I came uh to 5F was in October 2023.
47:09
And uh somebody at church in Miami told me about you, but I never I never saw you, never follow up. I went from church
47:16
to church to church finding looking for Jesus. But then I came here and uh that
47:22
day it was October 29, 2023 and you took me out of the group. You said you come here and uh out of the front you know
47:30
and and you pray for me and uh you deliver me from a stagnation from war
47:35
curses. You deliver me from um spirit of death
47:43
lying words spoken about me. And I came back on October and I came back in
47:49
November 23, December 23, January 24 was the revival in Miami. But when that
47:56
revival came to Miami, it was like the fire of God, it was all over me that I
48:01
wanted to serve. I wanted to to be part of this ministry. So I signed up to to
48:07
to assist in the Revival Miami. And uh it
48:13
was I was so fired up for God. when you announced uh floor I bought my ticket
48:19
and I didn't tell anyone but God I said God I know you're going to open doors and one of my prayer was that my husband
48:26
travels around the the USA for him to travel too so I can come
48:33
I just left it there and one day you said I pray that open doors for people
48:40
to come to flourish and I receive it and I felt it on my bones like I received this.
48:46
I left it there. The week before flourish, my husband said, "Damaris." They call me Damaris.
48:53
My full name is Ruth Damaris, but my family call me Damaris. So he said, "Damaris, I'm going to California." And
48:59
I was like, "What?" I started screaming, "Yes, yes." So that
49:07
was the week before I came to the week before flourish, the week of flourish. And after
49:14
one thing that that opened up my eyes was when in flourish conference on the
49:21
how do you call it the when you were praying for people you you
49:27
were praying for Mjam. It was the the impartation session. In the impartation session you were
49:34
start you started weeping that you felt the love of God for his people. And I was like, how? I didn't know how, you
49:42
know, because I think I wasn't seeing people like like God sees people.
49:49
But that's that stayed with me so much, you know. A month after God showed me
49:55
the love for his people and I started weeping and weeping and weeping just like you did, weeping and
50:02
weeping because that day I I was able he opened my eyes to see his love for his
50:09
people and it's so awesome. So, so I started serving. I started serving
50:16
in the Spanish uh translation team. I came back in uh for Flourish uh LA, New
50:24
York, Flourish Dallas and miracles happen started to happen in my family
50:30
like opening like these are my sons and at one point they they they didn't
50:36
believe in God but I forgot to say that uh on October 29 when you deliver me
50:41
that day I asked you can you pray for my son that he's sick and you pray for him
50:48
that's him
50:54
and I believe that word. I believe that declaration and I always told him
51:00
whenever you want prayer let me know and we come to LA. Whenever you want prayer come and we go
51:07
to LA he knows that. So for a rise and shine
51:12
I bought my tickets and I said if you want to come I'm going come. But I I I didn't pressure him, but
51:20
I invited him. And he said, "I'm coming." And I said, "Okay." I bought
51:25
the tickets. I bought the tickets for him and me in
51:31
February a week before or two weeks before. I
51:37
asked him because I didn't invited him. He So I said, "Do you want to come?" And
51:44
he was like, "Yeah, I'll come. When I booked the flights, I already
51:50
booked the flights in February. So it was April. We we we we travel round
51:57
trip, the three of us sitting together. Wow. Wow.
52:03
Another thing that h that that is God is God is a God of miracles. Um my dad
52:08
asked me for prayer and I said, "Oh, I'm going to send you a video." So I sent my
52:14
dad the deliverance prayer video. My dad lives in Costa Rica. So I I send it to him. I forgot about it. I forgot to ask
52:20
him or or follow up. A week and a half later, he calls me back. Damaris.
52:26
I weep and I weep and I weep.
52:37
And then he said the next day all my pain was gone.
52:47
And and and and he said that he has like a bad eye. He had like a bad eye a bad
52:52
eye vision with one of his eyes and he said I took my eyeglasses and I can see with that eye.
52:58
[Applause] So another m miracle that happened his
53:06
his university was paid for one year, right? Your college was paid for one
53:11
year. He didn't apply for anything. He was like, "Oh, mama, it's paid for."
53:17
A and and and God opening doors like uh my husband uh and I we went to buy some
53:23
uh watches and uh for our anniversary and and then they said, "Oh, it's going
53:30
to take like six months to a year." Da da da. And I got my watch like three weeks later. And he was like, "You're so
53:36
lucky." And I'm like, "No, this is God." The Bible says, "When you delight in me,
53:42
I will give you the your heart desires." So, uh, my husband is not in he's he's he's
53:50
not believing yet, but I've been declaring and I've been praying for God. God,
53:57
surround him with your servants. Send your servants to plant seeds. So, every time he travels, he's like, "Oh, that I
54:03
went to Austin and and the owner of the company, he was Christian. Oh, that is I was riding bike and the guy next to me
54:10
was a pastor. Oh, I went I went to Chicago and the owner of the company is Christian. Oh, ask them. It's
54:17
incredible. It's incredible how God is how God moves.
54:23
Hallelujah. So, so arise and shine,
54:29
he came and uh
54:34
he needs freedom. And uh so on Saturday he had some fungus on his
54:41
arms on his hands and he was like mom the fungus is gone.
54:48
Thank you. So one of the one of the things that uh he was diagnosed was with um an
54:55
autoimmune that is called useratis colitis and that uh that what it does is
55:01
that when you get a uh any illness like a cold or whatever instead of the the
55:07
autoimmune attack whatever you get it attacks your intestines and then you get
55:13
ulcers and diarrhea. That's why it's called eratic colitis. So we when I
55:19
invited him to Arise and Shine, we I said, you know, God can can heal you. Let's go. So he came.
55:27
You didn't pray for him. You didn't do anything. He was just there. And uh when we came back to to to
55:34
Miami, uh I told him, "Why don't you go to your doctor, get all the tests done, and let's see." Because he was feeling
55:40
well. Everything he was able to eat, things that he was not able to eat. So
55:46
he got all the test. He got a colonoscopy, blood test, biopsies and
55:52
stool test, stool test and everything came back normal. Praise God.
55:58
Normal. So one thing that I that I told him, we
56:05
need to go and testify. We need to go and testify. We need to go and testify. And he was like, no, no, no, no.
56:13
until I want to get all the results. So I said, you know what? One thing that that that needs to be broken and uh the
56:21
anointing is the only thing that can break that joke. It was that one of the nurses when he was first diagnosed, he
56:27
was receiving um an infusion and she she cursed him saying, "You will have this
56:33
for the rest of your life." And uh and and then the the doctor she
56:40
discharged the the chemotherapy. He's not taking any more chemotherapy.
56:46
That's a chemtrax. The Yeah, it's a chemotherapy. Yeah. So she she said you don't have to take
56:52
that, but the infusion you have to take and that infusion that's the thing that that nurse cursed him with that. So I
56:59
said we need to go back to church so that curse can be broken off. Yes. So that's what we're here for.
57:06
Amen. Praise God. You stand right here. God is going to touch you and free you and break this
57:13
curse now. Hallelujah. They overcame by the blood of the by the blood of the
57:18
lamb and the word of their testimony. So this testimony is how you were overcoming the enemy's attacks upon your
57:25
life right now. Hallelujah. I declare right now that every word spoken over you, negative word, be broken now. I
57:33
break those word curses now in Jesus' name. I break those word curses that you
57:38
would have this sickness forever. I cancel that. I nullify it in Jesus'
57:44
name. And I declare now that every last bit of sickness, whatever you were
57:50
needing the the infusion for, it must leave your body now in Jesus' name.
57:59
Be healed completely. receive this anointing upon your life.
58:04
May you have abundant health and abundant life in Jesus' name.
58:10
Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
58:17
Glory to God. Glory to God. Glory to God. Can you
58:23
stand right here? Thank you, Jesus. God is so proud of you for how you were spreading this revival in Miami, in
58:29
Florida, and in this small group, 5F Church small group. I see him increasing
58:34
the fire in you, increasing the anointing because this group is going to grow now more as you return upon this
58:41
impartation of anointing. I release more of his impartation now. May this the
58:47
fire of the Holy Spirit increase upon your life in Jesus' name. May many more come to this small group
58:54
in Jesus name. To this 5F group in Florida in Jesus name. Amen.
59:00
Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Glory to God.
59:08
Wow. Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I want to invite uh Casey
59:16
Knight. [Applause]
59:24
Casey. Oh, here she is.
59:30
Hallelujah. I hear you have a testimony.
59:35
Praise God. Um, all right. Well, I was planted here in February of 2023
59:43
and um prior to that, I was a Christian all of my life, raised a Christian. Um
59:52
but I was as lost as they come, you know. Um,
59:58
sorry. I was it just it was like one thing after
1:00:04
another in my life that brought a lot of bondage and um I was struggling with uh
1:00:10
deep generational curses of depression and alcoholism, self-hatred.
1:00:17
Um condemning thoughts. Um, I would just pray like for the Lord
1:00:24
to take me home often and I would search and I would search
1:00:31
for um him to
1:00:36
fix it all. You know, I would go to him, but like the churches that I was in, they didn't have um help like we do
1:00:44
here, you know, like there was just missing links. And um I had a hard
1:00:51
conversation with the Lord before coming here and I just kind of
1:00:56
said like I don't feel like this is a relationship. Like it's like a one-way
1:01:03
relationship. I'm praying to you and there's nothing coming back. Like I
1:01:08
don't know what to do. And um that's when he showed me one of your videos and
1:01:16
um I it just popped up and one thing led to
1:01:21
another and um I was like who's this girl gassing out demons in the in the park, you know, like I want to see who
1:01:28
she is. I started watching I think it was your revival is now TV show and um I
1:01:33
was learning so much and just it's like one video after another and I realized
1:01:38
my depression's gone and you know I was like wow where did it go? Um, and that's
1:01:46
when it clicked that something was real that with this and that I needed to continue to just watch the teachings.
1:01:54
And then um through that the Lord has delivered me in layers through um the
1:02:00
flourish conference. He broke off stagnancy. A few months later I came to True Grace and here and I was delivered
1:02:07
of an an orphan spirit. um soul ties, just literally all of it is completely
1:02:14
gone. Completely. It's a long list. Um and it's just beautiful. I hear from the
1:02:20
Lord. He He He guides me. He directs me. There's stuff coming in, you know. So, I
1:02:27
just um want to thank you for all you do. Um for for
1:02:34
just taking the heat sometimes because I don't know where I'd be with this. My marriage has been restored completely.
1:02:41
Completely. Yeah. Yeah. So, we're He's not here today, but we're celebrating
1:02:47
our 23rd anniversary. And it's just been the most biggest blessing. It's a beautiful, beautiful
1:02:53
life that I live now. And it just reminds me of like the verse where Jesus said, "Those who drink from the water
1:02:59
that I give them, they'll never thirst again." And that's
1:03:06
just where I'm at now. Praise God.
1:03:12
Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Thank you for sharing. Praise God. Glory to God

God is so proud of all of you. God is going to use you so powerfully to spread

1:17:36
It's time for revival in Japan. It's time now truly. And it's a you all
1:17:44

1:17:50
He's brought all of you here to receive impartation of anointing. You know this impartation is real as you heard Yuko
1:17:56
share. God wants to use all of you in this same way that his power would be in
1:18:02
you and you would speak, you would testify, you would spread his word, his good news and supernaturally this news
1:18:10
would spread and it would touch people and it would bring people to the kingdom of God in this revival and that you
1:18:16
would pray for people and they would experience miracles and their eyes would open up. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
1:18:24
God is going to release impartation of anointing upon all of you. And I speak over all of you right now. Any any
1:18:30
things that have been holding you back, every bondage must be broken off your life. I break every generational curse

1:18:44
you coming from worship of false gods in past generations now. And I speak right now this anointing to
1:18:52
come upon you all. Now may the power of God come in you and move through you and
1:18:58
touch many people in Japan. And may this revival fire spread wildly in Japan
1:19:06
through you. Let it increase and increase with every day as you come back to Japan in Jesus' name. I release this
1:19:14
anointing upon you now. Receive this anointing. Receive this anointing.
1:19:19
Receive more fire. Receive this now. Receive. Receive. Receive this now in

Hallelujah. Shane, can you prophetically declare this in
1:19:49
the Japanese language? Revival is now Japan.
1:19:57
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. God bless you.
1:20:06
Wow. Hallelujah. Wow. Jesus. Hallelujah.
1:20:17
I'm excited for what God's about to do in Japan. How about you? Hallelujah.
1:20:22
It's time, Japan. It's time. Hallelujah.
1:20:27
Woo. All right. Well, I want to just welcome right now, speaking of all of
1:20:32
those who were planted from around the world, we have, as you see, they come from Japan and they are planted at
1:20:38
Fivefold Church. We have so many people who are planted at FFold Church who are
1:20:43
tuning in joining us on on every live stream. We have people planted from 162
1:20:51

1:20:57
and this revival is growing by the day, by the week. This week we are welcoming
1:21:02
now 175 new 5F church family members, revival warriors.
1:21:10
The revival army is growing. Hallelujah. And all of these people of these new
1:21:17
revival warriors are from these 22 states and these 51 nations from around
1:21:23
the world. Praise God. We welcome you all of you who have just joined the FiveUp Church family and those watching
1:21:30
online and and and the revival army. And um I want to just invite anyone if you
1:21:36
want to be planted, if God is calling you to be planted here at Five Church, you can just go to fivefchurch.org/planted
1:21:42
or the link in my bio. Amen. All right. Well, we're going to get into the word of God now. Are you ready?
1:21:49
Praise God. All right. So, we're going to go right
1:21:54
now to Colossians 1 vers9. It says, "For this reason, since the day
1:22:02
we heard about it, we have not stopped praying for you, asking specifically
1:22:08
that you may be filled with the knowledge of God's will, his will, in
1:22:14
all spiritual wisdom, with insight into his purposes,
1:22:21
and in understanding of spiritual things, so that you will walk in a manner worthy
1:22:28
of the Lord. Lord, displaying admiral character, moral courage, and personal
1:22:34
integrity, to fully please him in all things, bearing fruit in every good
1:22:42
work, and steadily growing in the knowledge of God with deeper faith,
1:22:48
clearer insight, and fervent love for his precepts.
1:22:54
So, um, this is the amplified version. By the way, I want to read another
1:23:00
scripture. Ephesians 1:15. Ever since I first heard of your strong
1:23:06
faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for God's people everywhere, I have not
1:23:11
stopped thanking God for you. He's speaking this to the disciples, to the
1:23:17
people in the church, the believers. I pray for you constantly asking God, the
1:23:24
glorious father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to give you spiritual wisdom and
1:23:29
insight so that you might grow in your knowledge of God.
1:23:37
I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light so that you can understand
1:23:43
the confident hope he has given to those he called, his holy people who are his rich and glorious inheritance. I also
1:23:50
pray that you will understand the incredible greatness of God's power for
1:23:56
us who believe him. This is the same mighty power that raised Christ from the dead and seated him in the place of
1:24:01
honor at God's right hand in the heavenly realms. So today I'm going to be teaching on
1:24:08
growing in the knowledge of God. Amen. So, we're seeing these the we're seeing
1:24:14
Paul, we're seeing five-fold ministers now in the in the New Testament church
1:24:20
praying for the believers and teaching this importance of them growing in the
1:24:28
knowledge of God, growing in their insight to be more in the spiritual
1:24:36
things, their understanding to grow. So this
1:24:42
shows us the great importance of knowing God
1:24:50
understanding the spiritual things. As the scripture says, when you understand the spiritual things, when you have the
1:24:57
knowledge of God, you'll be able to then please God. You'll be able to live morally upright and and and do what God
1:25:06
is asking and be in his will. Amen. So
1:25:13
what is the knowledge of God? First of all, number one,
1:25:19
it is God's heart.
1:25:24
First of all, knowing God himself. We have to know God and then we will
1:25:30
understand his kingdom. We will understand his ways. we will understand the spiritual
1:25:38
things that come from him. So it is so important that you have a knowledge of
1:25:46
God's heart and that you keep this knowledge. You don't forget it. So the
1:25:53
heart of God is full of love. No judgment, no condemnation. And it says
1:26:00
there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
1:26:08
So that that means he's not judging you for making a mistake. He has grace for
1:26:16
you. He understands that we are in a spiritual war.
1:26:22
So he's not looking for immediate perfection when you become a believer.
1:26:28
He knows. He understands even he came in the flesh as Jesus. Jesus came in the
1:26:34
flesh as fully God, fully human and he went through temptations. He went
1:26:40
through feeling so hungry. He went through that discomfort and pain and suffering in the garden of Gethsemane.
1:26:47
He he prays to the father, "Take this cup from me, Lord." Even though Jesus knew that wasn't God's will. And so he
1:26:54
says, "This is what I desire. I'm praying this. I'm asking this but not my
1:27:00
will be done. Let your will be done. So he understands our weaknesses. He
1:27:07
understands temptations. He understands we are in a spiritual war.
1:27:12
So he's not judging you when you make a mistake. He's looking for repentance.
1:27:19
Now there is the judgment of God that comes after we live our lives and die.
1:27:24
And then it says words will be judged. the the the the idol the negative words
1:27:30
we speak will be judged. But when we repent, he wipes them away. That
1:27:36
judgment comes when there's not repentance. But when if we would live a life of
1:27:41
repentance, if we would live a life of surrender and obedience, then God washes
1:27:47
away all of our sins. All of your sins are washed away. All of them. But you have to live a life
1:27:54
of repentance, a life of surrender. And then there is no judgment
1:28:00
for those who are in Christ Jesus. There is no condemnation. The Bible says not
1:28:07
there's no not simply there's no condemnation. There's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For
1:28:13
those who are living surrendered to God, for those who are living a life of continual repentance when that's needed.
1:28:19
Amen. So this is the heart of God. He is full of love. He is full of grace. He's full
1:28:25
of compassion. He is full of mercy. And he's a real person. He's not He's
1:28:31
not He's not just this lord that's lording over you things just cuz he
1:28:39
wants to, just cuz he can. Everything that he asks you asks you to do is for a
1:28:45
purpose and is for your good. So he does not have all of these rules
1:28:51
that are with no purpose and that you just have to follow them for no reason and it takes the fun out of life. That's
1:28:58
not God. Every command he has for you is for your protection
1:29:04
is to leave is it it is a road map into receiving freedom and then maintaining
1:29:10
the freedom and walking in abundant life.
1:29:15
Amen. So God is amazing and magnificent. His
1:29:22
love we cannot even comprehend. His love is so amazing for you and for
1:29:28
every single person on this earth. He is nothing but good. Any evil that happens on this earth is
1:29:35
not God. Is not God. It's the devil. God is nothing but good.
1:29:41
His thoughts for you are nothing but good. His plans for you are nothing but
1:29:46
good. When you mistake make a mistake, his thoughts for you are nothing but
1:29:52
good. For I know the plans I have for you. Not
1:29:58
just for those who are perfect. That's not even a thing. I know the plans I have for you. All of you. Those of you
1:30:04
that would follow me. God says these plans are not to harm you, but to
1:30:10
give you hope and a future to prosper you. Amen.
1:30:16
Hallelujah. This is the heart of God. And this is this is the most important
1:30:24
part of having the knowledge of God, of having the knowledge of God's kingdom
1:30:29
and spiritual things is having this understanding of who God is. His heart.
1:30:37
His heart for you. His heart for all people. His heart for your future. his
1:30:42
heart for this world, his heart for the church.
1:30:49
Amen. Part of God's heart, the knowledge of God that is so important to have is his
1:30:57
is this love for his people. This great love for his people.
1:31:06
This love that he has for his people equals
1:31:12
freedom and healing. He loves his people so much that he
1:31:19
never wants them to be in bondage from the devil even a day.
1:31:24
He wants that bondage from the devil to be broken off of people's lives. There's
1:31:30
a difference between weapons formed against you
1:31:35
and weapons that prosper. He allows weapons to be formed against you to test
1:31:41
your faith. And he brings you victory as you stand firm and fight the good fight of faith.
1:31:50
But he does not want weapons to ever prosper. So yes, he allows
1:31:58
attacks of the enemy to happen, but it's all for your good. But he does not want any person to be in
1:32:07
bondage from the devil. He allows anxious thoughts to come in
1:32:12
your mind. But he does not want you to be bound with the spirit of anxiety.
1:32:22
He allows attacks from the enemy of temptation to come, but he's does not want you to be bound by addiction.
1:32:30
He can allow the enemy to send dark thoughts to you. But he does not want you to be bound by depression or the
1:32:36
spirit of death and suicide. He allows the enemy to bring attacks
1:32:42
towards your health. But he does not want you to ever have a bondage from the enemy of sickness
1:32:49
and pain. You understand the difference?
1:32:56
And so when a person is in bondage from the devil, this is a 911 emergency. God
1:33:02
sees it as this person must be free.
1:33:09
I used to be a lifeguard. It's my first job as a teen. And the Lord gave me this
1:33:17
vision today. Vision last night. Uh
1:33:22
how when people are in bondage, it's like they are struggling on the surface or
1:33:29
about to drown, gasping for air in the water.
1:33:37
And God chooses to use vessels
1:33:42
to deliver and heal people. He chooses to put power his power in them and use them to cast out demons and
1:33:48
heal the sick. And so God has called us to heal the sick, to cast out the demons in addition
1:33:54
to preaching that the kingdom of heaven is at hand as part of our great commission. And so
1:34:00
he's commanded us to be lifeguards in the spiritual realm.
1:34:05
He's commanded us to be ready to save somebody.
1:34:10
It's Jesus saving, but we're a vessel he say he he he he uses to save.
1:34:16
But that's our job to be available and and and and be be ready, be alert to
1:34:24
see if someone's drowning with demonic oppression and sickness.
1:34:29
And when we see them struggling, we are called to jump in that water
1:34:35
and save them. We are called to cast the demons out or
1:34:41
we are called to point them to where God's power is moving.
1:34:48
Point them to where they can be free.
1:34:53
And what you have in the body of Christ today is you have so many leaders,
1:35:02
Christian leaders, and so many just believers who
1:35:08
think it's okay to do the chill lifeguard job only.
1:35:15
I was a lifeguard and praise God, I never had to get in the water.
1:35:20
I never had to rescue somebody, but I was trained for it and I was ready for it and I knew that I signed up for this
1:35:27
and I was ready. I wasn't going to hesitate if I had to go jump in the water, even though it would be very
1:35:32
uncomfortable and scary feeling and it's a lot of pressure and responsibility.
1:35:39
Um, so I was thinking about the Lord was
1:35:45
reminding me of like lifeguarding, how chill the job was. I was at a um
1:35:51
in my home hometown there's only a population of 1,200 people. There's not even cell phone service to this day. And
1:35:56
so it was a town pool that wasn't very busy. So my job was very chill and quite
1:36:02
easy. Just sit out in the sun and I didn't really have to do much. Walk, please use
1:36:09
the ladder. That's that was most of my job. But you know,
1:36:16
it was chill. It was it was fun even. It there was no uncomfortable parts really.
1:36:24
And the Lord was showing me yesterday how many Christians that's the life they want. They want the
1:36:30
chill lifeguard life. They don't want to jump in the water and get uncomfortable.
1:36:37
Um leading people to where God's power is. speaking up
1:36:43
that revival is truly now and that people can be set free if they would position themselves where God's power is
1:36:49
moving. Speaking this today leads to persecution in in one way or another
1:36:58
because the enemy hates that more than anything for God's people to be free. And so when you speak up and you lead
1:37:04
you point people how to be free, the enemy is not going to like it. The enemy
1:37:09
is going to want to silence you. the enemy is going to want to stop you from doing that again. And so in today's time, the enemy's
1:37:16
strategy, the way he tries to stop you is usually through persecution. Is usually through the religious spirit,
1:37:23
the same spirit coming through the Pharisees, accusing Jesus, of being from the devil, of using demonic powers, of
1:37:31
going against the word of God. That same spirit is at work today.
1:37:37
That's this that's the that's the main spirit the devil uses to try to keep people from being free, to try to keep
1:37:45
revival from spreading is the fear and intimidation
1:37:50
spirit that comes by being persecuted.
1:37:57
And so there's many believers and there's there's many believers there's many Christian leaders who think it's
1:38:03
fine because they are doing their job as a lifeguard.
1:38:09
They're preaching. They're doing a lot of good things. They're doing their job.
1:38:16
But there's people drowning.
1:38:22
There's people drowning and you are looking the other way. That's horrible.
1:38:32
But there's many there's many believers, there's many Christian leaders who who think it's okay to look the other way.
1:38:42
They are missing the knowledge of God. They are missing the knowledge of God's
1:38:49
heart.
1:38:55
There is testimony after testimony of impartation here. We've heard some today.
1:39:01
Praise God. Like I'm telling you, the whole body of
1:39:07
Christ right now, every church, if if people who have not even been in
1:39:12
seminary, we hear these testimonies. Sarah, you shared one yesterday. Maybe
1:39:17
I'll have you share it next week. She just shared one yesterday of just a friend called her. She was led by the
1:39:24
Lord to pray for her and she heard the friend had to pull over. She was driving and started coughing out coughing up.
1:39:30
She was being delivered. Praise God.
1:39:35
But but there's there's these testimonies of
1:39:40
impartation. There's so many testimonies of impartation here. And these people who've received impartation, they are a
1:39:48
lot of them, most of them have not even gone to seminary. Most of them are not ministers.
1:39:56
What I'm saying is like, do you know how easy and simple it would be for church leaders around the world to receive
1:40:03
impartation?
1:40:09
If God can just pour it out so easily to what? You don't need all these things to
1:40:16
receive impartation. You just need to have that heart that will go and rescue someone when they need rescuing
1:40:23
with not caring what people will think.
1:40:29
Dying to your ego. That's all God's looking for. a pure
1:40:35
heart that's surrendered to him that will care about what God thinks about them than anything else. More than
1:40:41
anything else. Not caring what people think. Not caring what people will say. Not caring about connections. You'll
1:40:47
lose doors that will shut in you in your face now
1:40:54
because these people don't agree with you because these people are religious.
1:41:02
And and as I see this as I see I see people I see people here receiving impartation so easily
1:41:10
and it's it's grieving that pastors that other believers that that they wouldn't
1:41:16
just humble themselves and simply receive so that they can rescue the people in their churches
1:41:26
or even if even even to not even receive impartation but just to speak up and
1:41:32
say, "You need rescuing. Jesus can deliver you." I've heard
1:41:37
testimonies of many people being delivered here at this church. If we
1:41:42
could actually act like a united body, that we were intended to.
1:41:49
And I I I can go on and on about this, but I already did a few weeks ago in a
1:41:55
message. What's the message called again? Anyone remember?
1:42:02
prophetic word for pastors and leaders, but it's for everybody, not just leaders. So, go watch that message from
1:42:07
a few days ago. But the heart of God is to rescue his people
1:42:13
because he loves his people so much. The anointing is here. We do not have to keep praying for revival. We do not have
1:42:20
to keep praying for the anointing to come. It has come. It is here on this earth now. God has released it in the
1:42:27
body of Christ. Not just here at 5F Church. This anointing is to be shared
1:42:32
and passed. But people have to have the heart to rescue people, to free people,
1:42:37
not caring what people will think. They have to humble themselves and be pure in order to receive it.
1:42:45
I can't just I can't just go to every church building and say, "I release the anointing here. May the pastor now walk
1:42:51
in this anointing." It's up to the pastor, the minister. God only releases
1:42:56
it when your heart can simply be humble and pure and surrendered to him.
1:43:02
It's not hard to do that, but you have to do that. That's the requirement.
1:43:07
Amen. So, this is the heart of God
1:43:14
that people would be free and healed.
1:43:20
This is just as important as salvation. This is part of salvation.
1:43:27
Salvation, freedom, healing, being freed from the enemy's grip. They are all in
1:43:35
one. Preaching of the gospel, preaching the word.
1:43:40
That's why Jesus with the great commission, he says, "Preach that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the
1:43:46
sick, cast out demons all together."
1:43:51
He doesn't say mostly preach sometimes
1:43:56
cast out demons or some of you just deliverance ministries will cast out demons. He doesn't say that. He puts it
1:44:03
all there together. And there's a verse in the Gospels where it says Jesus went from town to town preaching
1:44:11
and a N d and casting out demons.
1:44:19
Like that was the ministry of Jesus. Hallelujah.
1:44:26
This is the heart of God. Many people are missing this knowledge of God.
1:44:35
Many people are doing things that they have learned. They have learned wrong
1:44:40
doctrine. They have learned wrong religious doctrine. Um Galatians 4:8 says, "But at
1:44:47
that time, I'm going to leave. I'm going to read Galatians 4 8-9 and then verse 12 right now. But at that time when you
1:44:54
did but at that time when you did not know the true God and were unacquainted
1:45:01
with him, you Gentiles were slaves to those pagan things which by their very
1:45:08
nature were not and could not be gods at all. Now, however, since you have come
1:45:14
to know the true God through personal experience,
1:45:22
or rather to be known by God, how is it that you are turning back again to the
1:45:27
weak and worthless elemental principles of religions and philosophies to which
1:45:33
you want to be enslaved all over again? Believers, I beg of you, become as I am,
1:45:41
free from the bondage of Jewish ritualism and ordinances in today's
1:45:47
time. Free from the bondage of religious doctrine that's been fed to you.
1:45:53
This old wine religious garbage that's not pleasing to God that keeps
1:45:59
you going around in circles of sin because religion is bondage. these
1:46:04
religious rituals and performing your way to please God, to try to please God.
1:46:12
For I have become as you are a Gentile. You did me no wrong when I first came to you. Do not do it now.
1:46:22
So you find so many believers, so many Christian leaders,
1:46:27
they are looking at what the majority is doing and the majority is not casting out demons. and walking in the
1:46:34
anointing. But but there's many people that are famous. There are many people who who have tons of followers. There
1:46:40
are many people that are that have so much success in the Christian world and they're not doing these things.
1:46:48
So many people they are not humbling themselves to receive this greater
1:46:53
knowledge of God's heart and they are continuing in this wrong religious
1:47:00
doctrine. They are praying hours on end. They
1:47:07
think that they are really being a great Christian.
1:47:14
But in fact, in reality, they are missing God's heart.
1:47:21
In reality, they are not rescuing God's people.
1:47:27
They are preaching nice words while people are drowning in bondage and they
1:47:32
are smiling pretty and they are preaching with passion.
1:47:38
But God's people are drowning and they can't even hear.
1:47:47
The Bible says John 15:12, "This is my commandment.
1:47:53
Love each other in the same way I have loved you." There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's
1:48:01
friends. You are my friends if you do what I command. So he's saying to you, Jesus
1:48:08
laid down his life for his friends. He laid down his literal physical life.
1:48:14
But he is asking you, he is asking us to also lay down our lives.
1:48:21
Not to make ourselves to be killed. No. as a sacrifice. Jesus already did that.
1:48:28
But he's the Bible says, "You cannot be my disciple unless you pick up your cross and leave everything to follow
1:48:35
me." So he is calling all of you to lay down your life for your friends, to lay
1:48:42
down your life for your the strangers, for for people that are really God's
1:48:48
children that he loves so much that are drowning. to lay down your life like a lifeguard would lay down their life for
1:48:54
a stranger drowning in the pool.
1:48:59
Amen. It's worth the persecution. That's
1:49:05
laying down your life. I'm going to be used as a vessel of God right now to deliver this person.
1:49:11
Whether it's casting the demon out by rece after you receive anointing or leading them to where God's power is moving, pointing to them to where they
1:49:18
can receive freedom. You're laying down your life. You know, there's a cost to that. When I was when I was training to
1:49:24
be a lifeguard and I took the test, I had to go to the bottom of a 12-oot pool and grab a brick and bring it up and
1:49:31
swim with it on my back. That was really difficult. That was very uncomfortable. And if I had to save
1:49:38
somebody, I would be risking my own life putting that person first.
1:49:44
All right. This is what God has called us to do. not be comfortable Christians
1:49:50
who don't have any persecution. I am convinced Romans 8:18 passion
1:49:57
translation. I am convinced that any suffering we endure is less than nothing
1:50:03
compared to the magnitude of glory that is about to be unveiled within us.
1:50:10
And this is my message. I I I pray that people watching online, people here who
1:50:16
who are like the the comfortable Christian out there that that are not laying down your life
1:50:24
for God's people. I pray that God would open up your eyes and would give you more knowledge of
1:50:30
this of God's heart and also this spiritual knowledge of this scripture
1:50:35
that the suffering that you endure that comes from persecution. Persecution
1:50:42
is not fun. Persecution stinks. Okay, I'll tell you that. It's
1:50:48
suffering. It's part of the suffering we are called to on this earth. But I'm telling you,
1:50:55
this suffering we endure is less than nothing compared
1:51:01
to the magnitude of glory that is about to be unveiled within us.
1:51:11
The magnitude of glory of revival spreading of lives saved and moved into
1:51:16
real surrender to Jesus of lives healed and delivered and transformed. It's so
1:51:22
I'm telling you, I've been through a lot of persecution, but this glory that I'm experiencing and even more that will
1:51:28
come. The glory of God I get to see in my life, the fruits for his glory is far
1:51:35
greater. It surpasses the suffering I've had to endure, the
1:51:41
suffering of persecution.
1:51:47
It's a life of so much greater joy. greater glory and most importantly it's
1:51:55
the only life where you will actually please God. Stop fooling yourself
1:52:03
by being a comfortable Christian
1:52:09
doing your religious rituals. Stop fooling yourself. You're not pleasing God.
1:52:16
Get to know God's heart. Grow in the knowledge of God's heart for his people.
1:52:23
Know what really matters to God. He's appointed you to be a lifeguard in
1:52:29
the spiritual realm. Jump in the pool. Jump in the water and rescue his people.
1:52:37
You're not here to get a tan and look good. [Applause]
1:52:45
Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
1:52:57
So the message today, I I'm I'm God wants you to know the importance of growing in the knowledge of God. Because
1:53:04
what I've been trying to what I've been sharing with you is that there are Christians that have been Christians for a long time that are even successful
1:53:10
Christians, influencers, Christian leaders who they're limited of. They're
1:53:15
so limited in their knowledge of God. They're limited. They have limited
1:53:21
knowledge of God's heart. And you see how dangerous this is, how detrimental
1:53:26
this is when you simply don't have the knowledge of God's heart.
1:53:32
What really matters to him. He doesn't care about your religious rituals.
1:53:39
He doesn't care how many hours you're praying and reading the Bible and all the the the the the things you are
1:53:44
preaching if you are not rescuing his people who were in bondage
1:53:50
leading them to be free. How to have the knowledge of God. How to
1:53:57
grow in the knowledge of God. Well, the Bible is so clear about this.
1:54:03
It says, it says in um Matthew 3:10,
1:54:10
the prince, the disciples came to him and asked, why do you speak to the people in parables? He replied, because
1:54:17
so Jesus is saying this, because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom
1:54:24
of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.
1:54:31
Verse 13, though seeing they do not see,
1:54:38
though hearing, they do not hear or understand. In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah. You will never You will be ever
1:54:44
hearing but never understanding. You will be ever seeing but never perceiving. For this people's heart has
1:54:51
become callous. They hardly hear with their ears. They and they close their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with
1:54:57
their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn. and I would heal them. But blessed are
1:55:03
your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear. For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people long
1:55:09
to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it. So he's saying blessed are you
1:55:16
your eyes see. He's saying other people they do not see because their hearts have become
1:55:22
callous. How do hearts become callous? By one's choice.
1:55:28
by one's choice to not humble themselves. Simple. That's it.
1:55:35
Pharaoh Pharaoh was given many opportunities.
1:55:40
Many opportunities to humble himself, to humble his heart and be obedient to God.
1:55:49
God gave him chance after chance after chance. That wasn't just for anything.
1:55:55
That wasn't just for God to show his wonders, doing all of those signs and wonders in Egypt. the amount of them.
1:56:02
God was continually giving Pharaoh free will, a
1:56:08
choice, speaking, revealing to him, like showing
1:56:14
him, revealing himself, giving him an opportunity to have
1:56:20
understanding of God, that he was real, that he was all
1:56:25
powerful, that he was the only God and his the other gods were rubbish.
1:56:32
and that he should obey him. God kept
1:56:39
showing himself. I mean, kept bringing different
1:56:45
destructions upon the land. It wasn't all at once. Pharaoh just kept choosing to keep the pride.
1:56:55
His son did not have to die. All of the firstborns did not have to die. But Pharaoh chose that. He chose
1:57:05
for his heart to become callous.
1:57:14
When the disciples came back from casting out demons for the very first time, one of the first things that Jesus
1:57:20
says is, "Father, I praise you for hiding these things, the spiritual
1:57:25
things we keep hearing about in these scriptures, the spiritual things from
1:57:31
those who are wise and proud and only revealing it to the humble and
1:57:37
childlike." So the word is very clear.
1:57:44
The pure in heart shall see God. The pure in heart shall gain understanding.
1:57:52
Shall have more of the knowledge of God. Shall know God more. Shall understand
1:57:57
him and his ways. It's very simple. And to be pure is a
1:58:04
choice. It's not about luck. It's not about some people are born with it, some people are not. To be pure in heart is a
1:58:12
choice everyone can make. Everyone can make. And God is so good to
1:58:19
pursue people and reveal himself to lead them into repentance if they
1:58:25
would only choose. Everyone can choose this.
1:58:32
Everyone can choose to receive the knowledge of the spiritual things that
1:58:38
it talks about in this scripture. The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom
1:58:43
of heaven.
1:58:51
So that's how you will gain knowledge and that's how you will keep on gaining more and more knowledge. The message
1:58:58
today, the message God has for you is that he wants you to keep on growing in
1:59:03
knowledge every day. To never become stagnant, but to keep
1:59:09
growing because that is how you will be able to stay in his will and he will be able to
1:59:17
use you even more powerfully with every day is when you become more spiritual.
1:59:25
It's how you become more like Christ is by your eyes opening up more to who he
1:59:30
is. Because when you when you can see who he is, then you can imitate that.
1:59:40
When you see who he is, when you see his heart, then you know what you're supposed to be like on this earth.
1:59:49
What Jesus is really like. that he really is this good, full of
1:59:54
love. The more your spiritual eyes open up, the more you'll be able to love people better. You'll see them how God sees
2:00:01
them. The more your spiritual eyes will open up, the more your faith will grow.
2:00:12
the more you will not give into temptation to complain and to step out
2:00:18
of God's will when things don't come in your timing
2:00:23
because your eyes have opened up to really understand just how good God is,
2:00:29
just how faithful he is, just how perfect his ways are, just how perfect
2:00:34
his timing is, just how much he is in control. How big
2:00:41
he is, the more your spiritual eyes open up. So
2:00:47
for your spiritual eyes to open up more and more is the most important thing.
2:00:53
It's how you're able to see God's love more and how then you'll be able to love him back the best and how you'll be able
2:01:00
to be a vessel of him the best and be in his will and be victorious over the
2:01:06
devil. The more your eyes open up to who God is and how big he is, you'll see how
2:01:11
tiny the devil is. And he'll never get to you again. He'll
2:01:16
never bother you again. The the taller you you'll stand with
2:01:21
godly confidence, the the the the the better you'll walk
2:01:27
in your authority, the more snakes and scorpions you'll trample on.
2:01:34
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So you need to to to to grow in this
2:01:42
knowledge always. You have to stay pure in heart. You have to keep humbling yourself. When you start to feel
2:01:50
thoughts of entitlement to come in, thoughts of jealousy to come in, thoughts of impatience to come in,
2:01:58
that's like a 911 alert. It should be like fire alarms going off
2:02:03
like, "Oh, nope. I'm not going backwards. I got to keep moving forwards. Forward.
2:02:11
God has opened up my eyes to who he is. That he is worthy of my surrender.
2:02:18
That I don't deserve anything. So why am I feeling entitled? Why am I feeling jealous? Get out of here. These lies.
2:02:26
Hallelujah. Why am I feeling impatient? God's timing is perfect. The reason the promise
2:02:32
hasn't come to pass yet is because it would crush me if it came now. It wouldn't last if it came now. When it
2:02:39
comes, it's God's perfect timing and it will be protected and we will enjoy it the most.
2:02:45
It will be the most beautiful when it comes in God's timing. Why am I impatient?
2:02:52
So, that brings me to the the next important thing of not only do we need to keep moving forward, but we need to
2:02:57
make sure you're not going backward. You need to make sure you're not losing the knowledge you gained. Because you know, you ever try to think
2:03:05
back 10 years ago and it's like kind of freaky because you can't remember certain things.
2:03:10
You like you remember being somewhere but you don't know remember who you were with. I did that the other day. I'm like
2:03:16
wow. Because it's not important to remember. Our mind can't store all that
2:03:22
all that information. We weren't built to store like every single little detail for our whole lives. You know what I
2:03:28
mean? And so what we do remember is what we value. What memories are important to
2:03:34
us. And so when God opens up your eyes,
2:03:41
you have to choose to keep that memory. You have to choose to keep that
2:03:47
knowledge that you didn't once have, but then you did receive one day. You have
2:03:52
to choose to keep meditating, meditating on it. You have to choose to to keep
2:03:58
remembering. Oh yes, I used to be in darkness in this area. I used to not know spiritually things in this area.
2:04:05
But then God opened up my eyes. I used to be lukewarm. I used to to not really
2:04:11
understand how worthy God was. But then God opened up my eyes to see how worthy he is of my surrender
2:04:18
and that nothing matters but obeying him. There was a day that my eyes opened
2:04:24
up. You have to remember that day. You have to renew your mind to that specific
2:04:29
knowledge that God gave you on those life-changing days that changed
2:04:35
everything. Or else you can go backwards. It can be a memory that is lost. That knowledge
2:04:41
you have received.
2:04:52
Proverbs 2:1, "My son, if you will receive my words and treasure my commandments within you, so that your
2:04:57
ear is attentive to skillful and godly wisdom and apply your heart to understanding, seeking it conscientiously and striving for it
2:05:05
eagerly. Yes. If you cry out for insight and lift up your voice for understanding, if you seek skillful and
2:05:10
godly wisdom as you would silver and search for her as as you would hidden treasures, then you will understand the
2:05:16
reverent fear of the Lord that is worshiping him and regarding him as truly awesome and discover the knowledge
2:05:23
of God. Hallelujah.
2:05:28
So you have to be searching after this wisdom. You have to be according to this
2:05:34
word, you have your ear has to be attentive to skillful and godly wisdom. You have to seek this understanding
2:05:41
conscientiously and striving for it eagerly. Hallelujah. You need to seek this wisdom
2:05:48
and treasure it as silver. Amen. Amen.
2:05:53
Colossians 3:8 says, "But now rid yourselves completely of all these things, anger, ra anger, rage, malice,
2:05:59
slander, and obscene, abusive, filthy, vulgar language from your mouth. Do not lie to one another. For you, for you
2:06:05
have stripped off the old self with its evil practices, and you have put on the new spiritual self, who is being
2:06:12
continually renewed in true knowledge in the image of him who created the new
2:06:18
self." Hallelujah.
2:06:27
So you have to be continually you have to continually renew your mind to put on the new spiritual self.
2:06:34
So when you become a a born again believer, when you become a believer for the f when you first become a believer,
2:06:40
you have a new self. The new self, the new you're a new creation.
2:06:46
But that's day one of your spiritual eyes opening up and the knowledge of God
2:06:52
coming in you. Just day one. It's a journey each day of seeking God. When
2:06:58
you seek God with all your heart, then you will find him. So as you keep seeking God, you find more of him. As
2:07:04
you keep seeking God, your knowledge of God and the kingdom of God and the
2:07:09
spiritual things, his ways, it increases.
2:07:16
It keeps on increasing. And so that becomes so you're like stepping into your new self each day
2:07:24
more and more. So you have to keep renewing your mind to according to the scripture according to the scripture it
2:07:31
says put on the new self.
2:07:37
So I'm telling you when years pass it be you really have to make the discipline to put on
2:07:43
your new spiritual self the aspect of your new spiritual self that you got on day one or year one
2:07:52
because like when your eyes first open up to how God is so worthy of your surrender and all you want to do is
2:07:57
please him. that is in your mind so sharp, the fire in your heart every day
2:08:04
at first, but then as time passes, you are going
2:08:09
to have to make the choice to put on again your new spiritual self
2:08:19
because it's a life of mountains and valleys. And I've seen this pattern in my life. And I've seen on mountains
2:08:27
I have just this overwhelming fire for Jesus.
2:08:34
Oh, it's just this fire to please him. It's so sharp in my mind. And I found in
2:08:41
valleys that I have to make the intention to put on my new self
2:08:49
because on mountain tops everything is easy, everything is exciting.
2:08:55
But in valleys things feel dry. They naturally feel dry. Wilderness is
2:09:03
dry. As you put on your new self, you will drink from the well that never runs dry.
2:09:12
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But it's the natural feeling. It's kind
2:09:18
of like when you step outside and it's so hot and you're like as opposed to a
2:09:26
beautiful normal LA day of like low 70s.
2:09:32
It's like in the valleys you have to make an an extra intention to put on
2:09:39
your new self or else you'll go backwards.
2:09:49
I remember when four the four and a half years of serving God when I started walking in my calling and I started the
2:09:56
church four and a half years before revival broke out and I'm holding on this promise that revival is going to break
2:10:02
out and I was having this expectancy it was going to break out like every week
2:10:08
for years and the church got smaller and smaller with each year through those years
2:10:15
and I remember like there was so many times thoughts would come to my mind like condemning thoughts like maybe I'm
2:10:23
doing something wrong. Maybe that's why it's not happening.
2:10:29
I don't know if I'm I hope I'm pleasing God, but I'm not sure completely because
2:10:36
of the because we're getting smaller. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.
2:10:42
You know, really condemnation would be there. And
2:10:49
I I I I had been free of those voices of condemnation in the past. I had been
2:10:54
free years before. But as time passed and I was deep in
2:10:59
that wilderness, the enemy came for a time he will come. The Bible says
2:11:06
when Jesus Jesus was tempted by the by the devil in the wilderness and it says the Holy Spirit led him there. And so in
2:11:13
a time of vulnerability, in a time of weakness, the devil came
2:11:19
because he knew his chances were better in the weak times and the weakness
2:11:24
and Jesus overcame and he defeated the enemy. He passed the test and then the Bible says that the devil left him for a
2:11:32
time. So the devil will come from time to time. So I had been free of the voice of
2:11:39
condemnation. That was what I dealt with the most before I was surrendered to God. Before I was baptized in the Holy
2:11:46
Spirit and then surrendered to God. I've been free of that completely. But then a few years passed and the church is
2:11:52
getting smaller and smaller and smaller and the enemy came and I would hear
2:11:57
those voices. And then then revival broke out and God
2:12:04
fulfilled the promise and it was a mountaintop and it was I mean it really spoke like I really I
2:12:12
felt God's love so much. I felt God's love so much when the
2:12:18
promise was fulfilled. It was like God was speaking to me. you
2:12:25
were faithful and I can trust you with this.
2:12:31
I can trust you with this. It It was like God was speaking to me that I have been pleasing him
2:12:40
and I it was so easy. It was so easy to feel God's love and no condemnation
2:12:47
on that mountaintop. And then I've seen in a different kind of wilderness in my life after that in a
2:12:53
different kind of you know waiting on a promise that you believe will come sooner
2:12:58
I would see the devil try to come back in that same scheme and God opened up my eyes
2:13:06
the importance of putting on your new self cuz there's going to be times on the
2:13:12
mountain tops you won't feel any condemnation or whatever thing you used to struggle with is it you won't feel it
2:13:19
at All you your eyes are so open to God's love and his truth and his ways.
2:13:26
So open. But then in the valley there will be a temptation.
2:13:33
The enemy will try to come back in those old ways. It's not as natural to feel
2:13:38
God's love in the valley. But the love is the same regardless. It taught me
2:13:43
when I came to that mountaintop of the promise being fulfilled. It taught me a lesson for the future. Like God was so
2:13:51
proud of you then. God was so proud of you in the valley,
2:13:57
but you weren't having these external blessings that showed God's proud of you.
2:14:05
But it wasn't a sign that you were doing anything wrong because you're in the wilderness.
2:14:10
This is God's love. He's proud of you. But you have to take the action of
2:14:15
putting on your new self, of reminding yourself of the knowledge of God, of his
2:14:21
ways, of the spiritual realm, how the enemy works, how the enemy attacks in a wilderness, when you haven't gotten a promise, and it hasn't come to pass yet
2:14:28
for many years. Um, yeah, the devil's going to try to attack. The devil's going to try to tempt you with impatience, tempt you to complain, tempt
2:14:35
you with condemnation, thinking you're doing something wrong. The devil's going to try to tempt you
2:14:41
and make you think like life's not that great. Try to try to try to distract you
2:14:46
away from seeing how blessed you are right now.
2:14:52
To have Jesus in your life, to have freedom that you once didn't have
2:14:58
and all the other different blessings God's given you, provision, family, friends.
2:15:04
So you you God, this is God's message for you today. He doesn't want you to go backwards. He wants you to continually
2:15:11
grow in the knowledge of God. But you have to do that work to renew your mind. Continually renew your renew your mind
2:15:17
with what God has shown you. Amen.
2:15:22
Praise God.
2:15:32
Second Peter 1:19. Because of that experience, we have even greater confidence in the message proclaimed by
2:15:38
the prophets. You must pay close attention to what they wrote, for their words are like a lamp shining in a dark
2:15:45
place until the day dawn and Christ the morning star shines in your hearts.
2:15:52
So um one of the one of the areas of knowledge of God when it talks about the
2:15:58
knowledge of God is talking about his heart. But it's also talking about his ways,
2:16:08
his spiritual principles because he he doesn't just move and do
2:16:15
his work on this earth half-hazardly, chaotically, just randomly,
2:16:21
but he is truly a god of order and he is a God of principles.
2:16:27
He he moves in a certain way, in certain ways. And so a big part of
2:16:34
this understanding that's that's what that is that is the new wine.
2:16:39
That is the new wine. When we talk about new wine, it's talking about God's ways, God's principles, the secrets of the
2:16:47
kingdom. When Jesus is talking about the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom,
2:16:53
it's talking about his ways and his principles.
2:16:58
to summarize some of his main ways and principles of moving on this earth. One
2:17:04
of them is that he chooses to use vessels to move in power to put his power in and he moves through them like
2:17:11
we see with Peter like we see through Paul like we see through all the apostles.
2:17:16
Another one of his principles is the I he has a principle of equipping his
2:17:22
believers and that is for every believer to be planted in one church that God has
2:17:28
called them to that is anointed that carries truly God's power and the secrets of the kingdom, the keys of the
2:17:35
kingdom. That's God's way and principle of
2:17:40
equipping his believers is by believers coming to the church, being true disciples and receiving the teachings,
2:17:47
equipping through the teachings of anointed servants of God. There's other principles about sewing and reaping.
2:17:55
There's principles about the power of making sacrifice and what that leads to,
2:18:00
the reaping that leads to. And I have many teachings of this. This is these
2:18:06
are I teach about these principles in depth in my book unlock your deliverance and also my YouTube playlist how to
2:18:12
receive and maintain complete deliverance. But this is part of the knowledge of God
2:18:18
that's so important is understanding God's ways because that's how you access
2:18:23
abundant life and that's how you can be a vessel of God truly carrying his power
2:18:30
and walking in his will. Amen. Amen. And so with one of his principles of how
2:18:36
he equips the body, uh, one of his principles is how he equips the body is through the five-fold ministry,
2:18:41
apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers according to Ephesians 4. And so this scripture I
2:18:47
just read about valuing this word coming from the prophets. This is so important to
2:18:54
gaining this knowledge and to keeping this knowledge.
2:19:00
This is the humble heart that helps you to gain more knowledge.
2:19:07
This is how you have a humble heart. One of the ways you have a h one of the ways you access this knowledge. One of the ways you humble yourself to receive this
2:19:14
knowledge is by valuing the words of God. This is mean the rama
2:19:20
present tense word of God spoken through anointed servants of God.
2:19:26
You're a leader at the church. So when you come to church, you hear the word and you value it as the word of God. You
2:19:33
take it to heart. You make it priority. You be you are a true disciple who
2:19:39
studies that word, who meditates on it, who listens to it again, and who truly applies it in their life.
2:19:47
That's one of the big ways that you will continually grow in the knowledge of God.
2:19:54
Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
2:19:59
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. So, I want to remind
2:20:06
there's some of you today, you need this reminder. Some of you that the enemy, you've been ah, I'm having these
2:20:11
attacks. It's just a matter of renewing your mind to remember the knowledge God has given
2:20:18
you. Don't go back to listening to the voice of condemnation. You already know the
2:20:25
truth. If you have made a mistake,
2:20:30
renew your truth with this word that a righteous man or woman falls down seven
2:20:36
times and rises again. Hallelujah.
2:20:42
[Applause] Thank you, Jesus. If you're feeling bad
2:20:49
about maybe you don't feel naturally on fire for God in some season, maybe you're in a valley season or something,
2:20:56
renew your mind that faith without works is dead. Faith
2:21:01
is not about your feelings, but it's about action. It doesn't matter how you feel. God is not looking at your
2:21:07
feelings. He's looking at your actions. Remember
2:21:13
what you've learned, value it, and you will keep growing. and growing and
2:21:18
growing in the knowledge of God. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
2:21:26
Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. We are going to give to God
2:21:32
right now. And I want to read a verse. It says in 2 Corinthians 9:10, "He who
2:21:38
supplies seed to the sewer and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed
2:21:45
for sewing and increase the harvest of your righteousness."
2:21:52
[Music] Um, I was looking at the birds that were
2:21:58
many birds were flying above me yesterday on my hike on the top of a mountain. As I was thinking about all of
2:22:06
the I've been speaking about God's great vision for this revival and his great
2:22:12
vision requires so much so many finances to expand this revival for all of God's
2:22:19
big plans. Amen. Thinking about this and I see all these birds flying by
2:22:26
suddenly. They were loud and they were just flying above me. And the moment I
2:22:32
see this fly, see the birds fly, the scripture I preached on Wednesday, uh,
2:22:38
Matthew 6, it came to mind. The scripture that says, "If God supplies
2:22:43
food to the birds of the air, how much more will God provide for you?"
2:22:50
Because you are much more valuable than birds.
2:22:56
And this is powerful. God provides for the birds.
2:23:01
according to the word of God. It's God who provides. So it's not just like
2:23:09
luck or science like the fact that a bird can find food
2:23:15
each day. God's hand is upon that. It's because of God according to that
2:23:21
scripture. How much more for you? You are so much more valuable than birds
2:23:27
in God's eyes. So much more valuable. Hallelujah. So every seed that you have with you
2:23:34
right now, all the finances that you have right now, the fact that you have a job right now, it's because of God.
2:23:41
It's not because of yourself. It's because of God. 100% because of God. Yes, you have to
2:23:49
take this step. You have to work, but he blesses the work of your hands. It's all God that you have any finances.
2:23:57
And I want to encourage you to grow in that knowledge so that you will not feel entitled to
2:24:04
that money that God has given you, but that you would see that it belongs to God,
2:24:11
that he can have his way with it. Amen. It's when you seek first the kingdom of
2:24:17
God that all these things are added. When you contribute to the work of God, he gives seed to the sewer. This
2:24:24
scripture says he gives seed to the swer. Not just he gives seed to all believers. To those who will sow,
2:24:33
who are sowing, he will give more seed. He will increase that seed as you sow.
2:24:40
He will see how he can entrust you with more because you're using it for his kingdom.
2:24:46
Amen. Um we we have revival is now Stockholm,
2:24:53
Sweden coming up in less than two weeks
2:24:58
and God has you know in the first couple years of revival breaking out 5F Church
2:25:05
we weren't hosting we weren't hosting hardly any re any
2:25:10
events in terms of finances. it was just pretty much Sunday services that we had to
2:25:16
cover as a church. Um, and in God has shifted things and it's a new season
2:25:23
where he is calling us to go and plan
2:25:28
events and host the events and pay for the events completely. And on top of
2:25:34
that, in this season, he is calling us to make the events free so that nothing is holding back people from coming.
2:25:41
I've noticed that when there are free events, there's many more people that come. And when we had ticketed conferences, it was to help pay for the
2:25:47
the venue costs cuz it's so high cuz there wasn't another way at this at this
2:25:52
time. Um, but we found that even though I would say if you can't afford it,
2:25:59
come. We will we will let you in for free. Just let us know. But even in saying that, not as many people would
2:26:06
come as when they were free. So that the Lord led us now in this season to make
2:26:12
these events free. So nothing is holding back anyone from coming.
2:26:17
But this means a greater cost for us. This means a greater cost for all of you that God is calling us to. He's calling
2:26:24
us higher to sacrifice more. So this event in Sweden, we have a graphic. I
2:26:31
want to thank everyone who has supported this fund, who's given to this fund for this event. We have raised almost
2:26:39
$26,000. Hallelujah. Thank you to everyone who has given for
2:26:46
this event. And the event is in just two weeks and we still need almost $85,000.
2:26:53
[Music] So, I wanted to show you this so you can really know the need and also that God
2:27:00
is really calling 5F Church higher. All of you higher. This is for his people to
2:27:07
be free. These events for them to know Jesus, to encounter his power. We have also other events that we are planning,
2:27:15
but we have not uh uh they're not they're not official yet cuz we are waiting to raise more funds until we can
2:27:22
start planning them. And so, if we can put that, we have New Zealand and Paris
2:27:27
that we are raising funds for. And I want to thank everyone who has so far donated. We have donated
2:27:35
uh 17,600 for New Zealand and 20 almost 26,000 for Paris.
2:27:41
But as you can see, there's still a great need. So I want to speak to all of you in New Zealand and in that area of
2:27:47
the world, Australia, and I want to I want to speak to everyone in Paris and surrounding nations, Europe. You know,
2:27:55
to receive from God, there is a cost. Salvation is free. But to receive more from God, there is a cost. This is God's
2:28:04
principle. When you sow, then you reap. [Music] When you seek God with all your heart,
2:28:10
then you will find all of him. Not just seek him a little bit. Salvation is free. And for people to receive
2:28:17
miracles, it's free. but to bring this event that will touch
2:28:23
thousands and shake the spiritual atmosphere to its core and make revival
2:28:30
to spread in these nations. There is a cost. And so I want to encourage you if you're
2:28:37
in those nations to to make a sacrifice for your nation.
2:28:43
Amen. Amen. And and for anyone around the world, if you have a heart for everyone should
2:28:49
have a heart for all of our brothers and sisters around the world. So I encourage you to give to these events so that we
2:28:55
can go and do these events around the world and more to come. Amen.
2:29:01
Hallelujah. So I want to speak over all of you now who
2:29:08
are giving. If you want to give online, you can go to fiveurch.org/give /give or the link in my bio if you're watching
2:29:14

2:29:22

2:29:30
Jesus' name. May more seed come upon you as a swer. May favor increase. I speak
2:29:37
supernatural favor over everything having to do with finances, bills, jobs,
2:29:44
houses, apartments. I speak supernatural favor now in Jesus' name. Let there be
2:29:51
increase upon you now in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. You can bring

2:34:02
And I and and God is leading some of you to to repent from going backwards, to
2:34:10
repent from not valuing the knowledge of God that he revealed to you.
2:34:16
and and for everyone, he's he's calling you to make a commitment to keep moving forward and keep seeking God, keep
2:34:24
knowing him. Amen. So, just take a moment to speak to
