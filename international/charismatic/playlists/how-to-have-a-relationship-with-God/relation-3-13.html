about god's amazing love for you today's valentine's day a
6:36
day of love a day that's centered on love
6:42
but i'm glad you're here and god is glad you're here because the definition of love
6:49
is god the bible says god is love
6:57
love only exists because of god you can only love and experience love
7:03
because you are made in the image of your creator who is love
7:11
god loves you so much
7:19
his love is infinite never ending incomprehensible
7:27
for you not just his people in general but specifically
7:34
you he loves you intimately as if you were the only
7:40
person on this universe this is the truth this is the word of
7:47
god god sent me today to to reveal to you
7:53
his love for you he says my people do not know how much i love them
8:02
i need you to tell them to reveal to them my love for them
8:11
hallelujah say god loves me god loves me
8:17
so much no matter what no matter what i've done
8:25
god loves me for me and he always will
8:37
to comprehend god's love is impossible but to start with
8:46
so you can kind of try to imagine his love for you
8:51
i know you all love people in your lives the greatest love that you've felt for
8:57
someone in your life whether it's your child your spouse a friend a son a daughter
9:04
a sister or brother that love that you have felt that you've experienced for that person
9:13
it's like a grain of sand compared to the ocean of god's love for
9:20
just you for just you
9:27
that's his love you can't do anything to change his love you can't do anything to mess it up you
9:33
can't do anything to make him turn away and change his mind he loves you as you are
9:42
he sees you as his beautiful creation he looks at you every single second with
9:49
adoration with devotion with awe and wonder
9:55
like you've looked at your children if you've had children before and you look at them with awe and wonder that's how he looks
10:02
at you now right now in this moment that's how he's looking upon you
10:09
he looks at you and he says this there is only one in the world like this
10:16
i've made my son my daughter perfectly and n nothing compares to him or her they
10:22
are irreplaceable and only him or her can accomplish what i've set them out to do to change
10:30
the world and to bring my kingdom to this earth this person right here you you hold a
10:36
special place in god's heart where where only you can bring him a certain kind of joy
10:45
there's a space reserved in his heart where only you can fulfill it just by being you
10:50
and just by you knowing his love and walking in relationship with him
10:58
this is the powerful love of god hallelujah
11:09
god today wants you to be confident in his love for you this
11:17
love that i explain to you right now this is truth this is the word
11:23
of god this is truth not the thoughts you have had in your
11:29
mind that are conflicting no what i have spoken right now is the
11:34
truth and god today wants you to be confident of this
11:40
he wants nothing to shake this truth nothing to shake how you see him how you
11:48
see his love for you
11:53
god's love is so incredible is so big and amazing and
12:00
supernatural that he when you when you have revelation of
12:08
his love and allow his love to fill you
12:14
and be in relationship with him you don't need anything else
12:23
you will feel complete contentment
12:28
you will never feel lonely even if you live by yourself are a single person when
12:36
you can have this revelation of god's love and it can stay in you this
12:44
contentment that never changes is possible and it's what god wants
12:51
for you more than anything you were created with this
12:57
hole this vacuum inside where your soul you long for it to be filled
13:06
you long for contentment for peace for joy for love for acceptance for purpose
13:16
every single person here feels that every single person here was born with that
13:22
there's only one thing that can fill that and that's the love of god
13:30
nothing else can fill it you can try things of the world you can try other things you can try even people
13:38
people to fill it it will never be filled you will always
13:43
feel lacking only the love of god
13:51
seeing how god loves you believing it knowing it and having relationship with
13:59
him that is the only thing that will fill you and it will fill you with such
14:04
amazing peace and joy that you stand out in this world it fills you with such peace and joy and
14:11
love that your love his love is so poor so big in you
14:17
that it overflows to everyone it cannot not over overwhelm and overflow to
14:23
everyone this is what happens this is what happens this is how
14:28
amazing and powerful and massive his love is
14:35
this is what separates you this is how people can see jesus is real by his love
14:42
fully in you fully known by you and overflowing to others
14:50
god wants more than anything in this world for you to know his love for you
14:58
specifically you not his children in general specifically for you this is what god wants
15:05
more than anything this is how you will fulfill your purpose this is how you will find peace and joy in this world
15:13
hallelujah so god sent me today
15:24
to co-labor with him
15:29
to fight for your love
15:35
god today is fighting for your love fighting for you to see his
15:41
love fighting for you to know his love he's fighting for you he's fighting for this i say the word
15:48
fighting because it is a fight it is a struggle
15:55
i know many of you sitting here have heard tons of thoughts in their
16:01
mind that are speaking the opposite of what i've just said today
16:07
many of you dealing with thoughts in your head i'm not good enough i'm not worthy god is far from me i think how can he be
16:14
close how can he love me many of you are think have been thinking these thoughts
16:21
right here shows that it is a fight it's a battle
16:27
to receive god's love to live in his love to keep on seeing his love the way he
16:34
sees you accurately this is a battle and god is fighting for you today
16:42
i am fighting for you for jesus today hallelujah by you positioning yourself
16:49
here today you are fighting to receive this love
16:55
and you will have victory today
17:02
amen
17:08
genesis 3 verse 1 it says now the serpent was more crafty
17:15
subtle skilled and deceit than any living creature of the field which the lord god had made
17:22
this is in genesis when god had just created the universe adam and eve
17:30
it says the serpent was more crafty subtle skilled and deceit than any living creature in the field which the lord had made
17:35
and the serpent satan said to the woman can it really be that god has said you
17:41
shall not eat from any tree of the garden and the woman said to the serpent we may
17:46
eat fruit from the trees of the garden except the fruit from which the tree is in the middle of the garden
17:51
god said you shall not eat from it nor touch it otherwise you will die but the serpent said to the woman you
17:57
certainly will not die for god knows that on the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened
18:03
that is you will have greater awareness and you will be like god knowing the difference between good and
18:08
evil so this here what i just read to you
18:14
shows us the beginning of the battle to know god's love
18:22
the beginning of the battle adam and eve knew god's love they saw god accurately
18:28
god loves me god loves me no matter what but one day the devil who was
18:36
full of deceit he came lying to them lying
18:45
aggressively not only did he come lying
18:50
but he made up lies about god's character he tried to say the
18:58
opposite of what was true about how god was he says
19:03
you certainly will not die when god said you will die so number one he says
19:09
that's absolutely false what god said that's what the devil said and secondly he says
19:18
you know what god's just trying to trick you because god doesn't want you to be powerful
19:23
god's got ulterior motives you can't really trust him that's what the devil was saying when he
19:29
said that here comes the battle to hang on to the
19:37
truth of this incomparable and
19:43
incomprehensible love that god has for you now adam and eve believed the devil they
19:52
were deceived they went with the lie but today we have
20:00
this word of god that we can learn from that we can be equipped
20:06
so that we don't make the same mistakes this word of god is powerful because it
20:13
shows us clearly exactly how the devil works the way that that the devil worked in an
20:20
adam and eve's mind planting lies and deceit
20:26
in their minds about the character of god about how god saw them that's the same
20:33
exact way he works today and he's been doing this for many years
20:42
it says he was he was crafty subtle skilled and deceit that's what it
20:48
says more than any living creature that was back in the beginning of time so he's improved by
20:54
now the point is this shows us this shows us what's going on
21:02
what's going on right now it's like if you're watching a movie you know a movie or a tv show maybe a reality uh dating
21:08
show or something and there's this drama where somebody plants this lie oh this guy that you love he's actually
21:14
doing this he's actually not who you think he is and you're watching the show and you're like no
21:20
don't fall for that lie it's just someone making up a lie no like there's this this man really
21:26
does love you this is the truth i hope you can see it and you get all nervous watching the
21:31
show in the movie you know what i'm talking about we've been there or maybe in your own life this is exactly what's going on in the
21:39
spiritual realm the enemy is constantly trying to lie to
21:44
you about how god thinks about you about how he sees you
21:50
and about who you are as a child of god
21:56
so when when we are equipped with this knowledge it changes the game
22:04
it changes the game without the word of god without the bible
22:09
we're helpless we're hopeless we don't know we even have an enemy and we don't know the strategy of the
22:15
enemy even it's like if you are playing a soccer game and you don't know that you have
22:20
any opponent so you're just dribbling down the field unaware that there's somebody who's
22:26
super skilled at soccer who's trying with all their might to take away the ball from you
22:32
you don't stand a chance if you aren't prepared for your opponent if you aren't prepared
22:38
of the opponent's strategy that's why soccer players they know okay they're gonna come this way i'm gonna do a trick
22:45
i'm gonna do a fake or basketball a pump a pump fake right you know the strategy you know how
22:51
they're thinking i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna out with them i'm not gonna let them trick me i'm gonna have victory amen
23:00
so as a child of god you have to know what's going on in the
23:06
spiritual realm you have to know that there is a battle constantly
23:11
but that you will always have victory as long as you do what god says as you go to his word as you remind
23:18
yourself of this truth as you choose to resist the enemy when
23:24
he tries to come and accuse amen
23:30
first peter 5 8 it says be well balanced and always alert because your enemy the
23:38
devil roams around incessantly like a roaring lion looking for its prey to devour
23:44
take a decisive stand against him and resist his every attack with strong
23:50
vigorous faith for you know that your believing brothers and sisters around the world are experiencing the same
23:56
kinds of troubles you endure so here it gives us direction this is
24:02
like the game plan okay you want to have victory this is how you have victory be well
24:08
balanced and always alert this is an assignment that god's given us he wants you to live in his
24:15
love always but you have to fight for it it it doesn't always become this like
24:23
hard fight jesus makes your yoke light your burden light amen
24:30
the bible says when you resist the devil he will flee from you so when you start doing this when you
24:36
start putting this into action i'm alert i'm alert to the mind the
24:41
thoughts that are coming to my mind i'm alert and i'm gonna resist everyone
24:47
over time the enemy realizes i can't get him or her i've lost
24:55
and he leaves you can't be tricked in your mind anymore the devil doesn't even try anymore
25:01
hallelujah
25:06
also this is powerful it says you know that you're believing brothers and sisters around the world are experiencing the same kinds of troubles
25:13
you endure be encouraged that you're not the only
25:18
one that has thoughts in your mind that are unwanted and conflicting from what
25:26
the truth is the enemy tries with everybody
25:32
there's nothing more that the devil hates than you knowing god's love
25:40
this is what he tries upon every single person to try to deceive them to try to keep
25:46
them blinded from the truth
25:52
second corinthians 10 5. it says we can demolish every deceptive
26:00
fantasy that opposes god and break through every arrogant attitude that is raised up in defiance
26:07
of the true knowledge of god we capture like prisoners of war every
26:12
thought and insists that it bow in obedience to the anointed one
26:18
so this passage reveals that the way that the enemy comes is in your mind
26:27
is in your thoughts this passage makes it very clear
26:34
the enemy will try to come speaking lies to you in your mind the enemy will try to come speaking
26:39
through other people lies and then will cause that to stay
26:45
in your mind and bring it up again remind you again and again and again
26:51
but you have power you have power over your mind you have
26:58
power over these lies you do god has given you the strength
27:05
when you make this intention of being alert and of taking
27:13
prisoner of war every thought it says every thought captive taking it
27:20
seriously i will not let that thought linger oh that thought in my
27:26
mind wait that does not align with the word of god that does not align with god's truth
27:32
oh i know what's going on here i know the enemy is lying to me right now
27:38
i will not believe it i will not let this be my truth i will not cause it to make me cry
27:45
and linger in that nope i'm being stubborn it says it says be be vigilant
27:52
hallelujah it says resist every attack with strong
28:00
vigorous faith you have the power to do it
28:05
be serious and vigilant no this thought is not truth speak it out loud so the
28:11
enemy hears you i don't agree with that thought that went in my mind god loves me god is close to me i'm more
28:19
than enough i am worthy i have a bright future god has amazing plans for me god is with
28:27
me god is protecting me i am lovable
28:32
i can do all things through christ i am beautiful i am fearfully and
28:39
wonderfully made this is the word of god i'm speaking this is the truth
28:45
of what god says about you and how he sees you so this is how you have victory when
28:52
those thoughts come you don't let them stay you don't let them be truth you don't voice them
29:01
you speak the word of god you say this is my truth this is my truth this is my truth and
29:07
the enemy has no choice but to leave it's a spiritual principle resist the
29:13
devil and he will flee from you so when you take intention in this when you do what the word of god says what i
29:20
just read to you the enemy has no choice but to leave
29:28
hallelujah the power is in faith so when you believe what i'm telling you
29:33
right now and you put it into action you will see the results you will see
29:38
the enemy fleeing you hallelujah so hallelujah thank you jesus
29:48
okay so so there's one thing i want to share with
29:54
you that's really important to know important to know so you have
30:01
you know the enemy strategy you you you're able to discern the truth and that's this
30:06
that when when we see the devil how he spoke to adam and eve he was
30:12
aggressive he said that's not truth
30:18
you most certainly will not die he was so he was a good actor right he was
30:25
confident he was aggressive when he spoke right right but when we
30:33
when we when we read the word of god we see how the bible says that with elijah he
30:40
wasn't in the earthquake he wasn't in the wind
30:46
but he was in he wasn't in the fire but he was in the still small voice
30:54
he was found in a still quiet voice is where god's voice was found
31:00
the bible also says you will seek me and you will find me when you
31:07
seek me go out to seek me with all of your heart that is when
31:13
you'll find me the bible says seek
31:18
and you will find knock and the door will be open unto you
31:25
so how god works is he wants you to come to him he does not
31:31
force himself on you he's here with arms wide open but the
31:36
principle in the spiritual realm of how it works how you hear his voice how you find his
31:42
presence is you seek him you knock like you coming here today
31:47
this is you seeking this is you positioning yourself to hear from him
31:52
to receive from him this is how god works whereas the devil is the opposite
32:00
he barges in your thoughts he barged into adam and eve and says hey
32:07
no i'm gonna tell you some lies right now boom that's how the enemy was
32:14
so i share this with you because
32:20
many of you do not know the spiritual principle that thoughts in your mind many times
32:27
are coming from the enemy are planted from the enemy whatever does not align with
32:33
god's word that comes in your mind comes from the devil specifically it did
32:41
not even come from you it came from the enemy
32:47
to try to deceive you into thinking it's truth
32:55
those lies that come i don't know if i'll make it i don't know if i'm good enough i don't know if i'm worthy maybe i
33:01
should just end it i don't know if anyone loves me i don't even know if even anyone sees me
33:07
i don't feel god i don't hear god i think he's far those are all from the devil and i expose them now in
33:13
jesus name so the spiritual reality
33:20
the spiritual truth is that feelings are not the truth most of the time
33:28
but the word of god is what's truth you can feel a certain way but it
33:34
doesn't doesn't mean that that's your truth you can feel you can feel
33:40
all sorts of fear hopeless about the future but the truth is that god knows the
33:47
plans he has for you plans to prosper you have to harm you to give you hope and a future the truth is is god is protecting you
33:55
you are his child and part of your inheritance is his protection
34:00
the truth is the bible says no weapon formed against you shall prosper so all of those truths are
34:07
opposite from what you're feeling inside
34:12
but when you do not know the spiritual reality of things
34:17
and you're living in the world just going with your feelings going with your thoughts the worldly way
34:25
is the feelings are the truth you give power to your feelings that's just the
34:30
worldly normal way it feels right to like like your feelings or your truth but
34:37
that's not how it is in the spiritual realm that's not the truth that's not god's truth and
34:42
god's truth is the truth is your truth amen so this is powerful
34:50
what i'm sharing with you right now this is going to free many of you because many of you have been bombarded
34:56
with these negative thoughts and because they are so much more
35:01
aggressive than the voice of god than your
35:06
experience your perception of the voice of god
35:13
of the presence of god you've thought that these emotions
35:21
and thoughts from the devil are truth because they seem to you more powerful
35:30
see so the word of god is powerful because it reveals to us
35:36
how how it works how you find god's voice how you find his presence and how the devil finds you the devil is
35:44
aggressive and loud god comes in a still small voice and you have to seek
35:50
so this is powerful because when those thoughts come you can remember this word okay just because these thoughts are
35:56
overwhelming me so much and i feel like i don't hear god at all that doesn't mean that they're true
36:03
the enemy is the accuser the aggressive accuser but god comes in a still small
36:10
voice he's with me all the time he's not in the feelings he's a spirit he's not in the feelings
36:16
he's a spirit he is with me this is my truth the word of god i'm going to the word of god
36:21
i'm going to the spiritual truth this is what's truth not my feelings no matter how big they
36:26
feel hallelujah amen
36:34
i want to share with you i want to expose one lie of the enemy
36:41
that many of you have been believing i'm gonna expose it as a lie right now
36:47
and that is that you should feel shame when you've messed up done something
36:54
wrong and you should feel shame about your past and that god is disappointed with
37:01
you i expose that lie right now that is never
37:06
ever truth the bible says that there is no condemnation in christ
37:12
jesus meaning jesus never condemns jesus
37:19
has compassion and understanding for you
37:24
i mean look how you think about a child a two-year-old child makes a huge mess everywhere costs you a
37:32
bunch of money because of the big mess but do you make the child feel shame
37:38
no you love them you hug them and you say it's okay let me show you a new a new
37:44
way to go next time i'm gonna show you a way that this won't happen again and it will be better for
37:50
you amen right so when you look at god and you look at
37:57
yourself that's a much bigger leap than a toddler
38:02
an adult amen in terms of the mind my point is is that if you can have
38:08
compassion and understanding and grace and no shame no shame but only love for
38:14
the two-year-old how about god for you i don't care even if you've done it tons of times over messed up the same
38:22
thing god's grace and compassion and understanding and forgiveness and love remains the
38:28
same for you hallelujah
38:36
genesis 2 25 it says that adam and eve were both naked and
38:42
they were not ashamed or embarrassed when they were first in the garden before the devil came
38:49
it says they were naked and unashamed and not embarrassed so they were like they had no idea like
38:56
god you can see everything that's how god wants us to be now in our lives
39:03
like we're not perfect we're humans we're not perfect but god doesn't he wants us to be open i
39:10
know you're not perfect and it's okay let me just see you all i love all of you the mistakes i love you all
39:17
i love you the same i love you the same i just want to see all of you because when you're this way it makes
39:23
you come to jesus it makes you want to come to him it
39:30
makes you want to follow him it makes you want to obey him when you can rightly see his love for
39:36
you and your imperfections it makes you fall even more in love with
39:42
him and it's the love of jesus that gives you the power
39:47
to obey him that's the only that's the only thing
39:53
that gives you the ability to not sin and to obey him the only thing
39:59
is seeing his love for you is having revelation of his love for you
40:06
hallelujah so but it says that when the the devil deceived adam and eve
40:15
then adam and eve then after they ate the apple they hid
40:22
and they said they they were embarrassed that they were they saw that they were naked
40:28
and they say to god i heard you in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked so i head and he said who told you that you
40:35
were naked so they accepted shame for the first
40:41
time which was a lie and then they hid from god
40:46
so this is the opposite of being able to see god's love for you
40:54
when you do this you are saying yes to the enemy and allowing him
40:59
to speak more and more and closing your eyes more and more from
41:05
god's amazing love for you that's what happens that's what the
41:12
enemy wants
41:17
the god says who told you that you were naked
41:23
in other words who told you that you should ever feel shame that's what he's saying
41:30
to you today that's what he meant when he said that to them who told you whoever told you that
41:38
was a liar i am never ashamed of you when you make
41:45
mistakes i love you just the same i never want you to feel shame never
41:55
this is the truth of how god is hallelujah it's any time you feel shame any time
42:02
you feel oh go oh man i'm god must be disappointed i can't believe
42:07
i did this stop yourself stop yourself right there and do what i just explained about
42:13
taking the thoughts captive that thought of oh i can't believe i did that oh no oh oh my gosh i can't believe i did that
42:20
ugh god must be disappointed that is all lies that you're believing
42:27
and you need to stop you need to stop right there you need to say wait wait i'm different now i'm different now
42:34
i'm a warrior of god and i'm fighting this battle i'm fighting to stay in god's love
42:40
i'm fighting to keep my eyes open and not have the blinders of the devil on i'm fighting for this so jesus
42:47
i'm sorry but oh i thank you for your forgiveness i thank you for your forgiveness thank you lord for loving me
42:52
as i am thank you jesus for giving me the power to change thank you jesus for never condemning me
42:58
just go to jesus like that go to him like that that's you being naked
43:04
and that's when you can see his love for you and receive it that's when you are in the truth today
43:12
you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free
43:18
thank you father the word of god is powerful i'm giving
43:25
you powerful truths for you to know today do you know that love keeps no record of
43:30
wrongs the bible says first corinthians 13 5 it keeps no record of wrongs
43:36
hebrews 8 12 god says i will forgive their wickedness and it will remember
43:42
their sins no more god has chosen to completely
43:51
forget your sins the one you did today he's chosen to forget
43:58
he has supernatural powers i know we don't really have that power but god can do it god's chosen to do
44:04
this amazing act this is his love for you you mess up and he's already erased it
44:11
away from his memory he can't see it and so you have been holding this thing
44:17
this bad thing that you did carrying it around feeling awful about it feeling regret
44:23
feeling shame feeling like god sees it all the time and that you can never be anything good
44:30
in this world and the whole time god's like what are you talking about i don't see anything
44:37
i don't see anything in your life i say nothing i see nothing but pure blameless spotless
44:42
that's all i see this is the truth this is the truth
44:49
hallelujah thank you lord lastly i'm going to share with you as we
44:57
close one last lie
45:03
one last lie that the enemy strategically speaks to all of god's people
45:09
i'm exposing this today and that is because you don't feel god
45:17
or hear him that he's not close to you
45:23
or that he doesn't love you as much as other people
45:28
that is a lie
45:39
your relationship with god is based on faith faith your relationship
45:46
with god is based on faith your relationship with god is not based on feelings
45:53
your relationship with god is not based on how you physically hear him physically see him
45:59
physically touch him no it is not that is how your earthly
46:05
relationships are but that is not how your relationship with god is
46:10
it is based on faith
46:16
in john 20 jesus appeared to the disciples to 11 of
46:22
them he appeared after he resurrected wow jesus you've risen from the dead we
46:29
see you but there was one disciple who wasn't there when jesus showed up
46:35
and then the eleven told him it was thomas we have seen the lord with our own eyes
46:40
but it says still unconvinced thomas replied there's no way i'm going to believe this
46:45
unless i personally see the wounds of the nails in his hands touch them with my finger and put my hand into the wound of his side where he
46:51
was pierced in other words i won't believe it's not real until i physically feel
46:58
physically see then eight days later thomas and all the
47:03
others were in the house together and even though all the doors were locked jesus suddenly stood before them peace to you he said then looking into
47:10
thomas's eyes he said put your finger here in the wounds of my hands here put your hand into my wounded side and
47:17
see for yourself thomas don't give in to your doubts any longer
47:23
just believe then the word spilled out of his heart
47:28
you are my lord you are my god jesus responded thomas now that you've seen me you
47:35
believe but there are those who have never seen me with their eyes
47:44
but have believed in me with their hearts and they will be blessed even
47:52
more did you catch that
47:57
there are those who have not seen me with their own eyes who have not heard my audible voice
48:04
who have only found me in this still small voice many times they weren't sure if they
48:10
were really hearing me or not but they are more blessed than you
48:17
thomas they are more blessed
48:24
i used to be insecure about my relationship with god
48:29
i used to be insecure i felt like i didn't really hear him i didn't know how to hear him
48:38
and it's unnatural when you're you know you're used to hearing audibly people and how do you hear god's voice
48:44
you know when you're becoming a believer it's natural to take a journey and learn and it not be
48:51
immediate and it not be certain okay
48:56
but there were also people in my life who would say like i heard god god told me this god told me
49:02
this some i even heard they say god appeared to me i heard god audibly you know there were
49:08
people in my life that would speak these things and that would make me feel insecure
49:14
and it would make me i would i would hear the lie of the devil that says maybe they maybe
49:20
god loves them more than you or maybe you're not being spiritual enough maybe you're not being quiet
49:27
enough and listening maybe you're not praying enough maybe you're not doing this enough because how come you're not having the experiences that
49:33
they seem to be having i was actually called to be an apostle i
49:40
was it was a prophecy and i was shocked because at that point i was still insecure super insecure about my
49:47
relationship with god and how to hear god and it made me bel i would believe the
49:53
lie that's like you won't be called to do something big for god because you don't hear him that well
50:03
but those were all lies of the devil those were all lies of the devil those were all lies of the devil
50:08
and even some people maybe even out of insecurities the same
50:14
insecurities that i had sometimes may even make up that they
50:21
are hearing god a certain way or had this big encounter the saw him visibly some people do
50:29
but in my experience i've seen that even some sometimes people will make that up and the enemy
50:35
will use that to make you feel insecure but i'm here to say that your relationship with god
50:41
is based on faith not feelings faith not feelings
50:49
god is not closer to people whom he's talked audibly to before amen
50:57
you don't always have to feel something
51:03
the bible says you cannot please god without faith
51:08
so it touches him so much when you are just taking the intention
51:15
to remind yourself of the word of god of the truth that as you're walking to the grocery
51:21
store god is with me i don't really feel much i don't really like you know
51:27
hear tons of things or anything but god is with me hi god
51:34
i love you thanks for being with me
51:40
god that was an amazing day thank you father for helping me through today
51:45
thank you for being with me jesus i love you simply throughout your day just
51:51
reminding yourself he's here he doesn't get any closer than that
51:58
he doesn't get any closer than that i used to be so insecure about my relationship with god
52:05
but i have grown now to be confident in my relationship with god i've grown
52:12
to be confident that i hear god's voice but i have never audibly heard the voice
52:18
of god i have never seen jesus appear this confidence has come only through
52:26
faith from encountering the power of god like
52:32
many of you are about to encounter right now i had encounters of my own
52:37
through a prophetic word through the baptism of the holy spirit
52:44
one encounter that increased my faith so much that after that encounter
52:50
i was different forever i was no longer insecure i knew god's with me god's with me he's
52:58
with me hallelujah thank you jesus
53:07
i even even long long into being an apostle
53:16
i went through a long a long time of desert wilderness time
53:22
and i was working hard for god doing what he was calling me to do
53:28
and then there came a time when i was really in the peak of my wilderness season
53:33
where i wasn't working as much i was still working a lot but i just was
53:40
like a little bit less and do you know that even though i had had this breakthrough
53:45
i've i've really put into practice what i taught you today there was a lie that came in my
53:53
head and i sort of believed it for a bit and that lie was
54:00
you're not seeing the breakthrough you're not seeing the harvest yet after all these years because you're not working hard enough
54:06
because you're not doing enough you know that it was just a couple weeks
54:12
later that the biggest harvest breakthrough promises fulfilled happened in my life
54:23
i share that to say that the devil's tricky
54:30
and you you have to be on guard anytime you hear something like that like now i've learned from that i've
54:37
learned to know god never condemns if he wants you to work harder
54:44
he convicts with love what does that look like like you positioning yourself to come
54:49
here and i happen to share a word one day about how god blesses the work of your
54:54
hands how when you work god then blesses
54:59
your hands the work of your hand so you have to go to work and then the next day you happen to open
55:05
up your bible and you read the verse that says whatever you sow you will reap
55:12
so all of a sudden you're you're having this revelation from god oh wow god blesses the work of my hands
55:19
what i so i will reap only what i sow so if i don't sow anything if i don't so much i won't reap much
55:24
oh i think that i should work more i think that i should do more i think god wants me to do more
55:31
do you see that conviction with love do you see how there was no condemnation shame
55:42
hallelujah so above all above all above all
55:49
you need to know that this love that god has for you is as good as it sounds
55:57
it is amazing it is amazing it's not too good to be
56:04
true this is really his love for you from today don't let the enemy fool you
56:11
another time in your life be aggressive with those wrong thoughts
56:19
jesus loves you so much just as you are and nothing can change that
56:26
