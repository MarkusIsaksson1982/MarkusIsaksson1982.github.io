Intro
0:01
when tests that God allows are failed what should one do from
0:07
there especially when God's will is the desire of the heart um you have to remember that God
0:15
is for you he's on your side and just like um you know if you're an athlete
0:20
training for the Olympics you'll have the best trainer to help you and
0:28
sometimes gold winning athletes don't make it to the Olympics on their first
0:36
try maybe not their second try either maybe not their third try but it doesn't mean that they they weren't destined to
0:43
go to the Olympics and win I I
0:49
um I I I heard this story of this woman who was who tried to swim she tried to
0:57
swim from I think it was Cuba to I think the key the Key West key the keys in
1:04
Florida and it was like several hundred miles and she was trying to want to swim there just non-stop and people would
1:12
like feed her um and they couldn't touch her she would tread water as she ate and it took like a few days and um she tried
1:20
several times when she was in her 20s I believe it was and failed um and then in
1:26
her um 60s she decided to try again and she tried I think it was like two or
1:32
three times and she failed and then she tried again and she made
1:38
it so um that's how it is in the spiritual realm too like just because
1:45
you failed one time doesn't mean it's over it doesn't mean that you screw you
1:50
you messed up your purpose your calling and that God just like moved on and gave
1:55
up on you no God is for you he's cheering you on and sometimes you might
2:02
not pass the first time but you are destined to pass you are destined to win and overcome so you have to remember
2:09
that just like training for a sport the Olympics
2:15
your trainer is cheering you on and is not like like leaving you when you mess
2:22
up when you don't make it when you don't win but they're cheering you on like it's okay get up try again you're going
2:28
to make it this next time believe in you that's how God is but so much more he's the best personal trainer that you could
2:36
ever imagine in this world so you have to remember that God is on your side he's cheering you on he hasn't like
2:43
given up on you and moved on or something so don't beat yourself up
2:48
about it just come to Jesus seek him and say Lord I want to pass every test I don't want to fail any more tests
2:55
anymore I want to get serious about serving you about being surrendered to you
3:00
about um passing every T every test and going glory to glory I want to be so serious about this Lord so help me uh I
3:08
need your strength uh and when you do that you will pass the tests you will absolutely pass the tests if you're
3:14
truly surrendered if you truly are surrendered and you come to God and you take it seriously you will
3:21
pass every test and there's another question about tests does God put us in a test of our
Does God test us
3:28
childlikeness absolutely God will test you in the
3:34
areas that he needs you to be strong in the qualities the the qualities of your
3:39
heart the qualities of your character that he needs you to be strong in he will absolutely test you in all of those
3:47
and so childlikeness SL humility those are uh two very
3:53
similar things basically the same thing humility childlikeness being
3:58
teachable not thinking too highly of yourself and being
4:03
prideful that will be tested and tested and tested and tested again because God
4:09
needs you to be humble not just a little humble but humble through and through
4:16
extremely humble that's what God needs from you so you absolutely will be
4:21
tested in that area several times continually throughout your
4:27
life we will have these tests we will keep on having this tests I mean
4:33
when you when God even lifts you and you go glory to glory more Temptations can
4:39
come because of success because of um how people honor you people look up to
4:46
you people respect you there's a different kind of Temptation that can
4:52
come testing your uh testing your humility tempting you to be
4:57
prideful so but God wants to lift You For Your Glory God wants that to happen God wants you to be an example for
5:04
others so as he lifts you there will absolutely be those Temptations slash
5:09
tests those Temptations God will use a test God will keep on testing you in that area and um not just humility every
5:18
area that God needs you to be to have of in your character Faith he will test
5:23
your faith in him again and again um he will test your strength he will test
5:30
your boldness he will test your patience he will test your gentleness he will test
5:38
if you are slow to anger he will test if you love your enemies all of the
5:44
different parts of your character the fruits of the spirit that God needs you to have God will
5:49
absolutely test you in these areas again
5:54
and again that's part that's how you're refined he brings these tests in these different areas is and then as you pass
6:00
those tests he he's refining you through it he's transforming you to be more
6:06
beautiful inside beautiful heart why can't I speak or pray in tongues is this
6:12
a gift only for some this is a gift for every child of God that God truly wants
6:17
every child to have because um the Bible says that praying
6:23
in the spirit praying in tongues edifies your spirit man so when you pray in the
6:30
in the spirit praying in tongues it's it's helping your spirit to rise and be
6:36
stronger and push your carnal nature down your carnal your flesh down also when you pray in the spirit you are
6:42
communicating with Holy Spirit directly you are speaking in a supernatural
6:47
Heavenly language straight to the holy spirit so because of these things like
6:53
because of what I just shared of what it is God obviously wants this for every
7:00
one of his children um and so This truly is a gift that God wants you to have the thing is
7:08
is that when it comes to speaking in tongues and really any kind of miracle any kind of Supernatural blessing from
7:14
God gift it doesn't always come on our timeline many
7:21
times we've received these things in the spiritual realm but we've but but but they haven't yet manifested completely
7:30
into the Physical Realm and the the the biggest key I can
7:36
give you of how to see all of these things manifest whether it's healing whether it's different
7:43
spiritual gifts whether it's speaking in tongues the key the great that the sum
7:49
the summary the the great key I can give you is to keep seeking God is to surrender more and
7:55
more and to just be after his heart and to not worry about anything else like
8:01
don't worry about not seeing the gift manifest yet have faith that it will
8:07
come it will manifest fully in God's timing as you keep seeking him as you
8:13
keep surrendering everything it absolutely will come how do we not miss the wave of Revival um
8:21
well on the message on New Year's Eve
How to catch the wave of revival
8:26
the sermon that I preached I taught in depth on this so I'm going to just refer to that uh that message as it shares
8:35
really that's really what the message was about was speaking about the prophetic word that um of how to catch
8:43
the wave of Revival how to not miss it but to summarize it it's to surrender
8:51
everything to God and be serious about serving him like never before so like
8:57
never before be serious in your surrender to to God and serving him and
9:02
being flexible with him like wherever he's going we will go we are ready I
9:09
mean to catch a wave is no small thing it takes it takes um a
9:17
lot of energy attention uh it you know you can't be
9:23
halfway in halfway paying attention of the you know when to get on the surfboard
9:29
and catch that wave like you need to be serious about it you need to be all in
9:36
aware and then it will happen then the timing will be right you will catch it
9:43
and you won't miss it so it's like that in the spiritual realm what do you say to someone that believes that sickness
9:49
is their portion because everyone dies of something so first of all you want to
9:56
make sure that the person's for first of all open to receive to
10:02
receive a word from God like um Revelation from God through you because
10:09
we're not called to force teaching Force beliefs on anybody but if they are
10:15
open then you can share with them you can share with them what God's taught you and testimonies that you've seen
10:22
Miracles you've seen happen Miracles you've seen in your life you can share with them how you want once thought that
10:29
this was just your portion the certain sicknesses that you had in your life was just your portion but then God healed
10:35
you of so many things and so many like little little things maybe you can share with them that you just thought you know
10:42
it's normal for people to have these these issues um you know maybe it's even
10:47
like allergies you know but God healed you from allergies like little things you can share with them um really by his
10:55
stripes we are healed is what the Bible says Jesus has has paid the price for us to have an
11:02
inheritance of Abundant Life to receive an inheritance from heaven
11:09
like the the gifts of Heaven what what heaven has healing and freedom and
11:15
Abundant Life and peace and joy to have it here on this Earth not just when we
11:20
die and go to heaven but Heaven has come here for us to experience Heaven here and now and um when it comes to a lot of
11:29
sicknesses they're actually coming from the enemy they're actually
11:35
coming as a as a attack a work of the devil to try to keep a person bound from
11:43
living out their full purpose to try to hold them back in some way to try to try
11:48
to hold them back in terms of peace and joy which affects their witness of Jesus
11:54
to hold them back physically sometimes I mean to do the work of God l lots of times there's a physical aspect to it
12:01
even if it's just like having energy you know um that's many times why sickness
12:08
what sickness is like the root of it is a work of the devil to try to hold back
12:13
children of God from fulfilling their purpose fully and shining the brightest
12:19
they can be for Jesus that Jesus wants them to be so that others may be saved
12:25
and find Jesus through them so when you understand that now you really you
What do you do when you think sickness is normal
12:32
desire healing and freedom you don't feel like lazy anymore in terms of
12:39
having faith and having hunger for these things but you realize that you don't
12:45
have to to have these things in your life you don't have to accept it and not only is that going to be a blessing for
12:51
you but this is how you're going to be able to fully live out your purpose and Lead so many others to Jesus and be the
12:59
best vessel of God you can be so um yeah I think sometimes maybe people are lazy
13:06
in the faith Department like they don't want to have disappointment that's many times when
13:11
people are like lazy with faith is because they're they're afraid of being disappointed of it not happening but um
13:19
God calls us to have faith to believe to
13:24
trust him to receive his full inheritance includes healing and
13:30
freedom and this person what you were saying you you're asking like what do you do when a person thinks you know
13:38
that sickness is normal because everyone like dies of something so God it's true
13:45
God absolutely does use sicknesses and can even use works of the enemy allowing
13:52
them even to um transition a person from Earth to
14:00
Heaven because we aren't made to live forever on Earth we are made to live in
14:05
heaven like to leave earth eventually and so go God does have a way of getting
14:12
us to Heaven many times it's using such things that attack the
14:18
physical body and eventually make the physical body not work anymore and that's when death comes death of this
14:24
physical body um so you know yes that's a reality but it doesn't mean that God
14:32
wants us to accept all the sickness even when we're older even when we're older
14:37
and sickness comes we should still trust God and believe God for healing and keep
14:43
on declaring by a Stripes I'm a I'm Healed not not just like get lazy right
14:49
like oh well I'm older okay well this makes sense I guess I'll just accept all of this no like for all you know God may
14:57
want you to have complete perfect health until pretty much the very end let's
15:04
just believe God for that and at the same time be content with whatever his
15:09
will is so if one is older and it is God's will for them to remain with a
15:16
sickness for some time before they pass away um then that's okay we are content
15:23
with all God is God and we just trust him and accept whatever he has for us
15:29
amen should you share your full testimony in detail when talking about Jesus with
Should you share your full testimony in detail
15:35
non-believers who are not surrendered or is there a time and season for it really
15:41
the answer to this question is just to follow the holy spirit it's going to depend on each person like a person may
15:49
not know much about Jesus therefore they aren't saved they aren't
15:54
surrendered but it may be a ripe time they may be open they may be desperate
16:01
maybe they're they're struggling so much in life and so maybe this is the time of
16:07
harvest for them maybe it's God's timing for you to really share it all I
16:15
mean just share with them the full story you know of how Jesus brought you from
16:22
death to life and that Jesus wants to do that for that person too you know like
16:27
the the Samaritan woman at the well she had a like she had a dark past and
16:37
she had so many different partners um having sexual relations with
16:43
them and that was extra taboo back then extra looked down upon back then
16:50
than it is now and um Jesus had this encounter with her and
16:57
just ministered to her prophetically and just revealed to her
17:03
that he knew these details of her life like what I just shared that she
17:08
had many partners and everything and and she knew that there was no way that he could know that unless he was God and um
17:17
unless God had told him and so she become she she falls in
17:23
love with Jesus as he shows his love to her through the power of God through the
17:28
prophetic Ministry just her eyes open up to his love for her um and that he
17:35
didn't judge her but he just loved her and delivered her delivered her
17:40
from the from shame from Spirits that came
17:45
through like mistreatment from those past relation from those relationships
17:50
and everything and and how people treated her just there was a Deliverance moment that definitely happened in that
17:56
moment of prophetic Ministry with Jesus and the Samaritan woman and then the Bible says that she went and told
18:02
everybody I mean she just told everybody he told me all that he told me everything about me um and she probably
18:10
would have shared more details I mean the way the Bible shares it she was just so excited there was hold she was
18:17
holding nothing back you know what I mean she was just I mean I'm sure people would have asked more questions too like
18:23
what do you mean he told he told you everything you knew and she probably shared more and so and then the Bible
18:30
says that all those people that she told they all came to Jesus like hungry curious and hungry and it says that so
18:37
many came to Faith came to belief in Jesus um because of that woman's
18:43
testimony so that testimony shares us like you can just tell she was pretty
18:50
much not holding much not holding much back it was a season of harvest in that time those people she was sharing it
18:56
with it was a season of harvest so lots of times as long as people are open
19:01
to hear it's totally great to share it all share the
19:08
details um but just it might depend on the situation maybe someone is not super
19:13
open maybe you start to share a little bit and you can just tell they're not open to hear more and so don't force
19:20
more on them but that's pretty much all you need to be looking out for if someone's open then share share Away
19:27
share details share many miracles that Jesus has done how to know if we spend
19:33
enough time with God in a day so it's important to not really have like a
19:40
benchmark number because then things can get religious um because like in terms
19:50
of in terms of like reading the Bible praying it it shouldn't be like I must
19:57
spend 20 minutes um at least or I'm not doing a
20:05
good enough job SP time with God that's going to be totally religious and really it should it should just be like how
20:11
when you think about your relationships on Earth you would never be like that you would never be like okay I'm going
20:16
to call my mom and I need to do my duty and spend time with her on the phone my
20:21
parents so I'm going to put a timer for 20 minutes and then once 20 minutes hits I'm going to say okay got to go
20:28
maybe you'll have maybe you'll have in your your mindset like I want to like show love and spend some time with on
20:35
the phone so maybe you'll think to yourself about 20 minutes like that's okay because you have other things you
20:40
have on your schedule and stuff that's okay but in terms of like the exact minute that's just not real real like
20:48
relationship you know um and so we we just really want to Veer away from
20:55
religion cuz that's where things get um like that's where that's where things
21:02
get not good like that's where the enemy can come in in that Spirit of religion sneakily and there
21:10
can be distance from God just because you've allowed religion in so um
How do you spend time with God
21:20
really first of all you should make it a priority to spend time with God in the
21:25
word daily or as much daily as you can
21:31
um and it's it's great to make a habit of it you don't need to feel like oh I don't want to be religious so I can't
21:37
read one chapter I better read two chapters this day and one chapter the next day and three chapters I don't no
21:43
no like you can still have um like a
21:49
habit of I'm going to read one chapter today you know that's fine but at the same time have uh allow Holy Spirit to
21:57
lead you when maybe he wants you to read two chapters one day instead or maybe
22:03
Holy Spirit wants you to really meditate on one scripture or one like certain
22:09
paragraph or part of the chapter rather than the whole chapter just make sure you're letting Holy Spirit in to lead
22:16
you and you're not just stuck in your rigid uh tradition habit you know um but
22:25
the the really to how to know if you're spending enough time with God is you should be number one making time
Make time for God
22:33
in the word for God and time um to talk with God set aside time to talk with God
22:41
to Comm to communicate with God to listen to God and also throughout your day you should bring God with you
22:48
throughout your days like include him in your activities include him and what you're doing renew your mind that he
22:54
really is here and he wants you to remember he's here with you and that he's helping you and he wants you to
23:01
have intimacy with him renew your mind throughout the day so as you're doing
23:07
that you are spending time with God like it's a continual amount that can't really be
23:12
measured the Bible says pray without ceasing that's a big
23:17
part of that meaning is Renewing Your Mind and inviting God in with what
23:23
you're doing including him and um also like just to be making
23:31
sure that you're not putting your eyes on things that are
Spend time with God
23:38
not of the spirit make like making sure that you're not spending time putting your your mind
23:46
on things that are dark things that are negative and things that Holy Spirit wouldn't approve of but when throughout
23:52
the day you're putting your mind your attention to things that God approves of
23:58
that's things of the spirit then holy spirit is with you holy spirit is with
24:04
you you are you are spending time with him so that's a part of spending time
24:10
with God too like you know just like right now even I'm spending time with
24:16
God you're spending time with God right now because I'm spending time with God
24:22
Is My Eyes Are Fixed On him and what he wants me to do and he's moving through
24:27
me and helping me do this right now minister to you I'm this is this is this
24:32
counts as spending time with God God's not in another room right now as I'm doing this you know and same for you you
24:40
are listening to God right now you are being with him doing what he wants you to do he's not in another room right now
24:48
so it's important that you remember that that you keep that in your heart and your mind that Jesus is with you
24:57
continue continually as you are fixing your eyes on him on the things of the
25:02
spirit it's not only in the in the like
How do I discern if a dream is of God
25:08
reading the Bible and prayer time that you're spending time with him how do I discern if a dream is of God or not
25:17
so first of all don't worry about trying to interpret like re if a dream is
25:24
really like complex you don't need to worry about like how I interpret this um
25:31
you know God won't When God wants to speak to you he's not going to make it hard to hear his voice he's not going to
25:37
make it confusing um and
25:43
so like many times God won't speak in tons and tons of
25:49
dreams when we are young in the Lord or still growing many times the main way
25:56
God will be speaking to us is through uh teachings through your Your Leader Your
26:03
Leader or leaders he'll be speaking in that way and also speaking through his
26:08
word and in just ways that are simple and not complex and not something that
26:14
you're really having a hard time figuring out because God wants you to
26:19
hear his voice and understand him more than you do um and I think many times we
26:25
kind of over complicate them so um it's important for you to know
26:31
that number one so number two knowing
26:36
that let's say a dream is kind of scary like it makes you feel
26:44
not good it it it just um brings some
26:50
sort of negative feeling or like fear or condemning condemning you like
26:56
when you wake up um you can pretty much know for the most
God can give warnings
27:03
part that's from the enemy if you are
27:10
knowingly if you are sinning if you are going against God you're not
27:16
surrendered then God can give warnings warning dreams so that would be the case
27:22
where maybe that kind of negative feeling dream may be a warning like stop it you are going against God um but if
27:30
you are surrendered to God if you are truly surrendered and you are seeking
27:37
after his will every day truly and you're not um doing things you know you shouldn't be
27:42
doing if you are pure in heart and remember feelings are not the same as
Feelings are not actions
27:50
actions so you can the devil can be speaking in the feelings but if you don't want them and you're not acting on
27:56
them that's not you you and so God's not going to be like warning you or
28:01
something um because just because of feelings that
28:06
the devil's giving you a warning from God like stop
28:13
sinning uh that kind of communication that kind of dream would be because of
28:19
actions you were doing actions of sin acting on the thoughts the emotions that the devil's placed that you've accepted
28:26
and now are Act acting on okay but um you know if if the devil for example is
28:33
giving a person thoughts and feelings that they don't want to have negative thoughts and feelings then just be aware that maybe
28:41
the devil could also send a bad dream um trying to make you feel bad
28:47
about those thoughts and feelings that you had trying to make you think that it really was you trying to trying to be
28:55
God and think make you think that it's God condemning you be aware of that be
29:00
be very aware you have to just always remember like these thoughts and feelings that you don't want to be having but they're happening and you've
29:08
been rejecting them but you still have them maybe they have the devil hasn't completely fleed yet but he he is and he
29:15
must and he must completely but if you are having those feelings and thoughts that you don't want be having negative
29:21
ones you have to be aware that the enemy this is like a scheme of the enemy like
29:26
you have to be wise and know this is a specific scheme of the enemy so I got to be aware in different areas where the
29:33
devil might want to try to reinforce this lie this false narrative
29:40
that the devil's trying to bring um but uh when God speaks through
Dreams are confirmation
29:47
dreams they are going to be many times confirmation they're going to be
29:53
bringing peace and and and um they're
29:59
just going to be bringing peace and many times they may be reinforcing Promises of God I know for me
30:05
personally many dreams that I've had actually actually are are
30:11
are like confirmations of promises
30:17
confirmations of prophecies and it's like God gave that as a gift to help
30:24
build my faith even more even I've seen him do that for me me um like before he knew a testing was
30:31
coming before he knew an attack of the devil was coming that would discourage me or that would try to discourage me
30:38
attack of the devil that was coming that was like making it feel like I'm going farther from the promised land from the
30:44
promise coming to pass then then instead of going forward um I've seen God bring
30:50
me those dreams to really reinforce to really help build my faith and I
30:56
remember even in the face of the attack just that dream coming to mind and it's
31:02
so it's just this sweet gift from God to help you
31:08
overcome um so so yeah that don't be don't try to don't be
Dont be confused about dreams
31:15
like too confused about about dreams um for the most part they're going to be
31:23
like when they come from God it will be peace it will become affirmation um and when when it's a bad
31:32
dream it's generally going to be just sent from the enemy so you just need to resist it unless you are knowingly doing
31:40
a sin and God sends a warning dream I had a dream I was left behind yeah so if
31:48
someone is not living surrendered to God if someone is hasn't given their life to
31:53
Jesus God may send a warning dream like that that you're left behind but if you
31:59
know you are doing your best surrender to God you are your your heart's desire
32:05
is truly to to be in his will you're doing your best doesn't mean you're perfect but when you do make a mistake
32:11
you do repent God isn't going to be sending a dream that you're left
32:16
behind you know that that's how you can discern you you that's how you concern
32:22
God's not going to make things so confusing and it espe especially like
32:28
there's so many people that the devil just plays around in the dreams with them like there's so many
32:35
people that God didn't call them to be prophets but they're on social
32:43
media pretending to be a prophet you know God gave me this dream and d d and
32:49
no the devil sent that dream and came as an angel of Light and wants you to conf
32:56
wants to use you to to confuse people and maybe just say the opposite of what's
33:02
true um you know that that's why that's why I say
God cant just be giving ambiguous dreams
33:07
like when someone God's many times not going to
33:13
get God's usually not going to give this like huge prophetic dream that God wants them to announce it
33:20
unless he has commissioned them to be a prophet to be an apostle to really be
33:27
this mouthpiece for many people because he has he has to he has
33:33
to trust that they will wisely interpret the dream and interpret it accurately you know um so he can't just
33:41
be giving like ambiguous dreams to like all these people and be asking them all
33:47
to be interpreting them and prophesying them that's a mess and that's what we see a lot today is people thinking God's
33:54
called them to be prophets and um speak these things that are just
33:59
bringing confusion to the body of Christ and sometimes I mean the truth is
34:04
sometimes like people want to feel spiritual and people want others to see them as super spiritual and people want
34:11
to have clickbait and so many times people can be like I had this dream of
34:17
the Rapture and and it's it's it's not from God but they know it will bring
34:25
fear and attention and all of that so you know we have to be wise of like who
34:31
we're listening to especially when it comes to people saying I had dreams of it's just people who we we don't know
34:39
who we don't know them we they haven't been identified as true Apostles
34:45
prophets ministers from God and we ourselves need to have the fear of God
34:50
and humility to realize that God's probably not calling most people to
34:59
be a mouthpiece of him in terms of dreams and and all that if I have been
Is God telling me to stop playing basketball
35:04
hurt a couple of times this week doing a passion of mine like playing basketball is God telling me to stop playing in
35:11
this particular season um well first of all if you're wondering if it's that specific
35:19
question um ask yourself
35:25
like for what is calling you to do the main things he's calling you to do is
35:30
the basketball taking away from it it is is do you find that there it feels like
35:39
a lack of time to do what God has called you to do um if so that could be that that God
35:47
was making time for you to do that thing I think when it comes to our our
35:55
passions our that that are like pure and good like when it comes to exercise passions I mean God wants us to exercise
36:03
he absolutely wants us to exercise so like exercising passions they're they're good things but at the same time um we
36:11
still C we still have to put what God is calling us to do number one
36:18
and like a like still surrender everything even the good
36:24
passions right and so um um you know
36:30
like sometime I love to go hiking but there's some Seasons where I just can't
36:35
um for different reasons or time won't allow or just things happen where I'm unable to and I recognize that's okay
36:43
like I can exercise in another in a different way and and it will sometimes it's going to take less time and stuff
36:49
and then there's a there's a um a positive side to that so there's more
36:56
times to do more time to do other things that God wants me to do for example so
37:01
whenever I see stuff like that happen in my life where like kind of like I'm unable to do something that I used to
37:07
enjoy doing I just um don't worry too much about it don't think too much into it but allow Holy Spirit to flow and
37:15
Lead me like okay this season things look different and that's okay um let me
37:20
follow the holy spirit with how he's leading me in this season right and so
37:25
at the same time though like as I was talking about job this
37:31
past Wednesday how he said the Lord gives and takes
God takes things away temporarily
37:36
away sometimes God takes things away temporarily he takes like job took
37:43
things God took things away from job temporarily He restored everything and gave double back I mean he couldn't
37:51
bring his children who died back to life but he had many more kids so pretty much
37:57
He restored everything and um even a double so sometimes when there are
38:03
testings when sometimes when there it sometimes God takes us through just simp
38:08
things that are just simply hard and uncomfortable and he's doing that as a
38:15
test he's doing that on purpose to refine us and so sometimes that can be the reason like when we see something we
38:22
love to do and it's a pure good thing but we're unable to do it something happens um it can be that it can be this
38:29
is a testing like God is testing will we be entitled and complain and be
38:35
distracted by this and be like God why can't I do this or will we just be
38:41
content be it be like how job was God gives and takes away okay in this season God allowed this to happen he allowed it
38:48
for a purpose I'm not going to like read too much into it I'm just going to say
38:54
okay Lord you allow this okay I trust you you allowed this for purpose and so I'm just
39:00
following your leading of of this new season how this new season looks
39:06
different that's what he's looking for so sometimes it's important also to not like read too much into things like like
39:15
maybe there's a good Godly p a a passion of some sort of sport exercise that we
39:21
do if we're unable to do it for one time it doesn't we don't need to read into it too much of like God saying You must not
39:28
do this forever but it could just be a season it just could just be a season where God wants you to just do something
39:35
different and go through a refining a testing of not being able to do
39:40
something you enjoy simply and how will you react how do you balance having
Balancing Godly confidence and humility
39:47
Godly confidence and humility that is a great
39:54
question and really what it comes down to
40:04
is like understanding what God has called you to do understanding what God has called you
40:10
to do if God has called you to do something then he wants you to have confidence in it and you don't need to
40:17
feel [Music] um like insecure about it so you need to
40:24
know that like when God has called you to do something he wants you to have confidence in it
40:30
but I think like the how to the how to do what he's called you to do for
40:37
example you need to always have so much humility there um I'll just give you an example
40:46
for me um my spiritual father has taught me
My spiritual father
40:52
so much and he has imparted the anointing in in me and so I know I know
41:00
that just because God planned it to be this way that he would be my spiritual father and that he would impart to me
41:06
and that God would use him as a mouthpiece you know to speak to me to
41:13
teach me spiritual things to equip me because God had planned it that way I
41:18
know that I wouldn't be where I am today without
41:24
him because I'm not saying like I need like God's not enough I don't mean it
41:31
like that I just mean this is God's way he uses vessels he calls us to be humble
41:38
and be planted under a spiritual father or mother that he calls us to be planted
41:43
under and there's so much teaching there's so much of God's voice there's
41:50
so much Direction that's going to come through your spiritual father or mother
41:55
Okay so so for my life I know like I did not see anointing moving through my life
42:04
at all through my Ministry until my spiritual father imparted to me I did
42:11
not have Direction in my life I did not have clear Direction I wasn't fulfilling
42:16
my purpose until God brought my spiritual father into my life and God
42:21
spoke through him I did not have um um I did not hear
42:28
God's voice very clearly the way I began to hear his
42:35
voice very clearly once my spiritual father came into my life and I started hearing God's voice so clearly through
42:42
my spiritual father but now also in the word of God like never before and the Holy Spirit speaking to me and so like
42:51
when I see like my Ministry I I just see
42:57
I see how my spiritual father is such a big part of it like because
43:05
God used him because he carried anointing and he imparted that anointing
43:10
to me because he had the spiritual wisdom and and taught me and taught me
43:16
so much and imparted wisdom to me um I
43:21
now could be a be a powerful Apostle of Jesus Christ who's
43:28
anointed because of that you know um and
43:34
so I'm a very weak and foolish thing like when I was called to be I mean when
43:39
God called me to be an apostle when my spiritual father Prophet Dr Jord DAV when he prophesied to me that I was
43:44
called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ I had no desire to be a minister
My transformation
43:50
I had no clue how to be a minister um I didn't want that but I
43:55
wanted God God's will above all else so I said yes God and when I said yes God I
44:01
didn't have this like immediate transformation where I
44:06
just automatically was hearing the audible voice of God and I just automatically just knew how to be a
44:13
minister and I just knew what to do no
44:18
no no no no no I didn't feel too much different actually the next day or the next day or the next day after
44:25
surrendering to God it was gradual this transformation but like when I accepted
44:32
that calling I was this such a weak and foolish thing where I'm like I don't know what to do I don't know I mean like
44:41
I was just the most normal person I know you see me in a different way especially those of you that don't know me from the
44:47
beginning from this was more than seven years ago I'm talking about when I first received this this prophecy over my life
44:55
um you see me as this like powerful minister of
45:00
God you know but that was not me seven years ago at
45:06
all and um so I was this weak and foolish thing who just asked lots of questions and was just this
45:15
teachable young woman and and I learned and I learned and I learned more and I
45:21
learned more and I learned more through asking and through continuing to be humble I wasn't like oh God called me to
45:28
be an apostle so I I got it now like he called me to
45:34
to be that to call me to do this so like I'm good I got it I'll figure it out God
45:39
will just speak to me everything um like without a vessel you know um no I wasn't
45:48
that way at all praise God because that would have been prideful but really I was like such a
45:55
weaken foolish thing and so I was so teachable um my I was able to
46:04
just never really act like I knew I know what I'm doing I got this that was not
46:11
me at all and still to this day that's not me like I got this I know what I'm
46:18
doing like to this day I I'm I'm still teachable I still ask my spiritual father many questions I still you know I
46:28
I still um I never want to be to that place of like um I don't need anyone I
46:36
don't need my spiritual father you know it's been several years now and I'm good now I never want to be at that
Gods voice
46:44
place and I'm not at that place I'm I'm still teachable I'm still learning I'm
46:51
I'm I'm still obedient to hear God's voice how he wants to speak to me like
46:57
God speaks through me so much through my spiritual father and that's not um it it's literally God's voice it's whether
47:04
God speaks in an audible voice whether God speaks in a dream to you whether God
47:10
speaks through the word of God or whether God speaks through a vessel it's
47:15
God's voice 100% so I've I've really learned that
47:22
that that's a big way that God speaks is through people and so I've learned to be humble to not force God to speak to me
47:30
how I want in a way that would make me feel um more important or
47:37
something but like if God wants to speak to me through my spiritual father awesome I'm just so grateful to hear
47:45
God's voice I'm just so grateful that I can hear God speak to me however he
47:50
wants to speak to me you know like that's my heart and that's how I've been able to like remain humble so what it
47:59
comes down to is like I I I I humble myself to hear God's voice not how not
48:05
how not how I want to hear God's voice my preference my favorite way I think my preference would be the audible voice of
48:11
God probably right probably most of us that would be the the preference and I probably would have his
48:17
number two favorite way to hear him number three number four so but I I I I I I don't care how God I
48:27
chose to surrender that I don't care how God wants to speak to me you know um and
48:32
so what but once I so once I know how God wants to speak to me so when I recognize okay when it comes to this
48:39
when it comes to this God wants to speak to me through my spiritual father so I hear God's Voice through my spiritual
48:45
father and I know this is God's voice God wants me to do this God wants me to speak this God want God wants me
48:52
to do this now God you know me as a leader a five full Church like God wants me to do this now God wants us to go
48:59
here now God wants me to speak this or something you know go I know God has called me to do that
49:06
because I've heard his voice but not because I've I've seek his voice how I want but I I I humbly SE his voice God
49:15
how do you want to speak to me and God will say to me through the Holy Spirit I want you to hear this way like for
49:22
example I want you to ask this question to your spiritual father and he will and I will speak and that will be my voice
49:28
like he will speak that to my my holy the holy spirit will speak that to me and so then I I have I I've heard the
49:35
voice of God and now I am 100% most confident person in the
49:41
world Godly confidence you know what I mean Godly confidence I know God has
49:47
spoken I know he's called me to do this and so I'm going to do this I'm going to speak this and I know God will back me
49:53
up I know what I speak is the the word of God I know what I spoke is the prophetic word of God yeah so that's
50:00
really how I would answer the question is to just constantly humble yourself
Humble yourself
50:05
and when it comes to hearing God's voice humble yourself with how he wants to
50:11
speak ask questions um that God wants you to ask
50:17
um and and like don't think you know best that kind of thing um and then when you
50:25
have heard God's voice and you're confident in it not like you had a dream and you want to
50:33
feel spiritual and so you just you you just live in denial that God gave you
50:40
this dream for example no no no I mean like really humble yourself and seek the
50:46
Lord's voice when you humble yourself and seek the Lord's voice you will hear the Lord's voice however you will you
50:53
will go to where the Lord's voice is and and and you will hear it and you'll be confident in it you'll know this is
51:00
God's voice and then you'll be you'll have Godly confidence that God wants you to have and I really even see in my own
51:08
life how I I like just see how I I can see why God chooses weak and
51:15
foolish things people that are like I don't know what I'm doing who am
51:21
I because when that's not your heart when you're
51:28
like more of a like know it all there's just so much
51:35
temptation [Music] to go your own way do your own
51:44
thing and and lose God's way lose God like
51:50
like lose sight of God's way of speaking and ditch spiritual like parents and
51:56
stuff you know like I've seen how badly the enemy oh my
52:02
gosh I I tell you I've seen how the devil has tried to to pull me from my spiritual father
52:10
I've seen his sneaky disgusting schemes time and time again over spans of
52:18
years um and I've seen like only if you're humble would you pass this test
Who am I
52:26
I've seen I've seen it I've seen like if there was someone like prideful in this
52:32
position they would probably take the bait like he comes so sneaky and tricky you
52:37
know so it's so important you remain humble it's so important that we in this
52:45
season the it's I'm so excited what God's doing now of making way for the
52:51
weak and foolish things to be accepted when
52:59
when PE God calls the weak and foolish things he anoints the weak and foolish things so that they can be humble they
53:05
can see themselves rightly who am I I don't know what I'm doing I need God I need help I need a teacher I need a
53:13
spiritual father or mother you know childlike like that who am I I I need
53:20
help I need guidance I you know um right now in this Revival God is is making
53:29
moves and making his true anointed ones the weak and foolish ones to be accepted
53:35
this is where the right leadership will be in place that's pure that's humble
I need God
53:40
will be truly led by the holy spirit will see themselves rightly for as they
53:46
are Who Am I who Am I who am I I need
53:51
God I need the the the the
53:56
the the the things he's put in place in the body of Christ to help us as
54:03
Believers a fful Ministry spiritual father spiritual mother Apostles prophets I need them if I'm going to do
54:10
what God has called me to do how do you know if God's calling you to bring someone in close to form a
54:17
relationship or if it's a selfish ambition or
54:24
distraction um well I would say that it's important to be equally
54:30
yolked the Bible says do not be unequally yolked and this is talking about relation this is talking about
54:36
marriage but this is also talking about friendships Jesus only brought three people really close to him uh James John
54:45
and Peter and then 12 were semi close and that was it so three were like
54:51
really close and that was it okay so
54:57
that's a good like standard for us to know the people close to us should
55:03
probably like very close should be one two three maybe four or so but it should be
55:12
a small number um the people that you bring really
55:17
close need to really be surrendered to
55:23
God they need to to be on the same Mission as
55:29
you they so that they can really fully support the mission God has called you
55:35
to you on the Bible says iron sharpens iron the people you bring the closest have to be
55:44
Iron sharpening iron if they're not iron sharpening iron they're a
55:49
distraction they could be used by the enemy in some way there are Christians
55:54
who carry old wine who carry religiousness in them there are some
56:00
Christians whose eyes aren't open up in a certain certain area and the Bible says uh that that that the the the
56:08
spiritual things are foolish to the carnal mind the carnal man so in other
56:15
words you can be a Christian but your spiritual eyes can be shut in some
56:21
area and if they're shut in some area you are they you're going to call it
56:30
foolish if you are humble your eyes are are are open already or if if they
56:37
aren't fully opened well I actually want what I want to say is like let's say there's layers
56:43
there's layers there's like different layers of the eye so there's like belief that Jesus is our Lord and savior is
56:51
like one layer and then um there's another layer that reveals you know Jes Jesus is with
56:59
you all the time and loves you and does not condemn you and wants the best for you like revelation of of the character
57:05
of Jesus like that's another layer and then I mean there's just so much
57:11
different kinds of understanding of the spiritual realm a lot of layers okay
57:16
then that there's another layer a layer that understands what Jesus has brought to us the the the the
57:24
healing the fre the Abundant Life he's brought to us now there's another layer that is opened up you understand the
57:30
spiritual realm that we are in a spiritual war that the devil's real that he's still bringing he still has Works
57:36
he's doing yolks he's bringing upon people um and and that demons exist and
57:42
that that demons are behind a lots of problems that people have these are
57:48
yolks and and Jesus wants to break that yoke okay and then then there's another layer of like what breaks the Yol the
57:55
anointing the power of God Jesus puts anointing in vessels that he chooses not everyone he
58:02
wants to put it in every child of God but he has to trust you he doesn't trust everyone all of his children so he puts
58:10
them in trustworthy vessels and then when you position yourself where the anointing is flowing
58:16
through a trustworthy vessel who carries the anointing the anointing will come upon you and destroy the Yoke and you'll
58:21
be delivered and then there's another layer then there's another another layer of how God equips his his body and and
58:30
and releases this anointing to his body and and speaks to his body Apostles and Prophets and evangelist pastors and
58:35
teachers and and God there's another layer that that God has said that there
58:42
is no longer uh there's no longer um male or
58:47
female and he's po out his Spirit on All Flesh and God wants to use men and women
58:53
in the same way spiritually that's another like there's there's lots of different layers there's lots of
59:01
there's another layer that understands principles the principle of sewing and reaping like what that means
59:09
the importance of it how to properly sew so you can reap the way God wants you to reap there's another layer that
59:16
understands the principle of Honor what God means when he says give honor to whom honors is do and
59:25
how God wants us to effectively honor how he wants us to honor Servants of God what happens when we honor that's
59:32
another layer I mean there's so many different layers okay so to be equally
59:38
yolked is when you and the person the layers the layers they've
59:46
opened up and the I mean you might not be the exact same equally Yol it's not
59:52
like you have to be exactly exactly the same but you need to be close you need to have the main things down and when
59:59
one is humble their eyes their layers have already been opened up and the
1:00:04
other layers are ready to quickly open up when one is humble and teachable
1:00:11
layers have layers have already been opened up in their eyes and they have a
1:00:16
desire to learn and so let's say if you share with them a testimony you share
1:00:22
with them something about the spiritual Realm something about honor the principle of honor the principle of sewing and reaping that they didn't know
1:00:28
yet but they're humble they're their eyes are ready to open up so their eyes will open up they'll grab it yes oh wow
1:00:35
thanks for sharing that my eyes just opened up and now their layer has just opened up okay so the so equally yolked
1:00:43
means the hum humble humble teachable
1:00:50
and surrendered and their I eyes are opened up and if they're not fully
1:00:56
opened up they're ready to quickly open up because they're humble you know that when you bring a
1:01:02
person in close that they're they're they're not going to call the spiritual things that God's
1:01:09
revealed to you foolish if you if you if Holy Spirit can
1:01:15
show you if Holy Spirit shows you that a person that you bringing close is going to call the things of the spirit foolish
1:01:22
don't bring them close because they're going to be used by the devil when a person a carnal
1:01:29
person when a person says that's foolish that's of the devil that's wrong I know
1:01:35
better let me show you all this scripture they are being used by the devil just as the Pharisees were being
1:01:42
used by the devil they are literally being used by the devil so don't take it
1:01:47
lightly don't bring just anybody in close the only people you need to bring
1:01:53
you should be bringing in close are those that will be Iron sharpening iron not those that will be used by the
1:01:59
devil and dull you instead of sharpen you so when you keep that in your heart
1:02:04
and your mind it will be clear it will not be confusing it will be clear who to bring in close it will be very clear it
1:02:11
will not be difficult God will make it clear and many times that's not a lot of people most times it's not a lot of
1:02:17
people most times that can be one person two people depending on the
1:02:23
season all right so if it's if they if they aren't equally yolked like I just
1:02:28
described then beware that is the enemy trying to come as a distraction and
1:02:34
trying to come and and stifle your fire trying to dull you instead of sharpen
1:02:40
you trying to indoctrinate you with religiousness like the Pharisees did uh
1:02:47
were spouting religious nonsense that decreased faith in
1:02:53
Jesus their the way they're being used by the devil Led Led to people not even like
1:03:01
standing with Jesus when he was being crucified I mean hardly any of the
1:03:06
disciples were even there at the cross with him so much Faith was lost in Jesus
1:03:16
because the voices of the Pharisees were speaking lies lies lies lies says so
1:03:24
don't let those voices in closely it's very dangerous to your spiritual health
1:03:32
the things God has opened up your eyes to your eyes are open up right like you
1:03:37
know that you know that you know you can't unsee your eyes have opened up and when your eyes are opened up it's
1:03:44
powerful oh it's powerful it it means that you have more to give this world like you have more of
1:03:51
Jesus more of his truth more of his life to reveal to the world that's a precious
1:03:59
thing so you want to protect that okay so when you let the wrong people in they
1:04:07
like make you qu they make you question what you
1:04:13
know they make you lose confidence in what you know your eyes were like this
1:04:19
and now your eyes feel heavy it's like they're trying to close your eyes your eyes we open I see and I want to share
1:04:27
the truth I want to share with others I want to be bold and share the truth and
1:04:34
share my testimony and as you're doing this with bright eyes the light of Jesus
1:04:39
is shining from you out of you so powerfully and leading others into the
1:04:44
light leading others into the truth when you let the wrong voices in
1:04:49
and they're they're trying instead of iron sharpening iron they're d yelling you they're your your eyes are open to
1:04:56
the truth and now they're speaking against the truth and they're speaking in uh intellectual way like the
1:05:03
Pharisees were and with the Bible and with logic and all of that and so it's
1:05:11
making your eyes be heavy it's there there the shutting of your eyes is happening where you're not as sure as
1:05:19
you were and you it was the truth okay and now you're not able to
1:05:24
Shine the Light as brightly and be as confident and bold and now you're um afraid to share your testimony now
1:05:32
you're afraid to share um The Works of God the Miracles that are happening the
1:05:38
word of God you're afraid to share about the Revival because you're not like completely sure
1:05:45
anymore but there's no reason that you used your eyes have had seen your eyes
1:05:51
had seen protect what your eyes have seen protect how your eyes have opened
1:05:57
up amen this is real wisdom take it take this wisdom you know I mean
1:06:05
um the Pharisees were had the greatest knowledge when it
1:06:12
came to the word of God and so they were really seen as the most like
1:06:18
trusted people of God so then Jesus comes along
1:06:24
and and disciples people's eyes opened up wow this is truth this is God like
1:06:31
I've never seen eyes opened up and then all of a sudden if they go and get
1:06:37
coffee with the Pharisees they just decide to listen to the Pharisees a little bit all of a sudden the Pharisees
1:06:43
are so confident and they're saying look at the word of God here he's going
1:06:48
against it here look at the word of God here he's going against it here he is a
1:06:54
false prophet God has told me God gave me dreams he is a f like the Pharisees
1:07:02
would have been I mean we read in the word they were speaking with such confidence and when you have a pure
1:07:12
heart sometimes we can be naive we got to make sure we're not naive that's why I'm giving you this wisdom so you have a
1:07:17
pure heart but you have wisdom innocent as a dove wise as a serpent when you don't have this wisdom and you have a
1:07:23
pure heart you don't realize that like these people you looked up to actually are
1:07:30
prideful deep down and that's making their eyes to be
1:07:36
shut and also there's jealousy there which make which which is making them to
1:07:41
have so much hatred that it's making them full of confidence and Zeal to speak these things against
1:07:49
Jesus but when you're like naive with a pure heart and don't realize about how
1:07:54
people can be prideful and stuff you can just be so confused cuz you can be like
1:08:00
well I've trusted them they're the most knowledgeable people of God and they
1:08:05
have platforms and everything they have a lot of people following them like it seems like God's favor is with them and
1:08:12
they're so confidently speaking this if they're so confidently speaking this and
1:08:18
maybe it's true it's very dangerous like this
1:08:25
confusion just comes in people of God who do not who do not have this wisdom
1:08:30
that I'm sharing about how when there is pride eyes are shut eyes will not open
1:08:39
up and they will be so shut that they will call Jesus from the devil they will
1:08:45
say the opposite of what is true so in these days in these times we must be
1:08:53
innocent as a do and wise as a servant we must walk in this wisdom to not allow
1:08:58
the wrong voices in there are a lot of wrong voices out there we got to be so wise we got to be so wise
1:09:07
Hallelujah I'm going to declare over you all right now thank you
1:09:14
holy spirit thank you Jesus for all that you have done on this live thank you for
1:09:20
the wisdom that's been imparted on this live Jesus I declare
1:09:26
now that you would walk in such wisdom in Greater
1:09:33
wisdom that any scheme of the devil to try to distract you to try to bring
1:09:40
confusion angel of Light that you would spot it that you would hear the voice of
1:09:46
the Holy Spirit helping you letting you know of the devil's
1:09:51
schemes and that you would never never be deceived may you never be deceived again I declare may you never be
1:09:58
deceived by the devil coming in tricky ways in tricky ways like through
1:10:04
dreams through Pharisees of today through the angel of

Light May you never be deceived again but may you walk in
1:10:17
humility so that God's voice can be clear to you and your eyes would remain
1:10:22
wide open Up in Jesus name layers in your eyes of your eyesight in the
1:10:28
spiritual realm that have not been opened fully may they open up in Jesus
1:10:34
name and may your eyes be opened up wide
1:10:39

1:10:57
