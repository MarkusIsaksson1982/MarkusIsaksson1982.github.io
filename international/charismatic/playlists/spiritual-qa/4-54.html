What is Binding and Loosing?
0:00
i have a um message on YouTube where I talk in depth about binding and loosing
0:05
um it's deliverance questions answered when it talks about whatever is bound in
0:11
heaven will be bound on earth and loosed in heaven will be l loose in earth it's basically just talking about walking in
0:17
authority and for God's heaven for God's for God's will to be done on earth as it
0:22
is in heaven so the will of God in heaven for there to be no sickness and
0:28
oppression and his will to be done for there to be peace and joy and abundant life um and no evil and no um darkness
0:38
that's what we are called to bring to this earth so it's basically just saying bringing heaven to earth and walking in
0:45
your authority to do that um commanding demons to go releasing heaven on earth
0:56
some people religiously think they have to like say the words I bind I loose and
1:02
everything but it's it's really just about walking in authority and bringing heaven to earth simply
How to Know if What is on Your Heart to Share is of God or Not?
1:11
how to know what on your heart to share is of God or not
1:18
peter both confessed that Jesus was Lord while also telling him to not go on the
1:25
cross well the honestly it comes down to humility if you are being careful to
1:33
make sure that you're not allowing pride in your heart um but that you're that
1:38
you're continually humbling yourself and you know before you speak something
1:43
strongly like a a very big word
1:51
that you are making sure it's coming out of the place of humility and you are
1:57
operating out of the wisdom of God humility and um not just your own
2:03
feelings or or anything with your own motive so that's the that's the biggest thing
2:09
um you know Jesus had revealed so much that
2:15
he was more than a teacher more than a prophet but that he was the Messiah he
2:20
was truly revealing this so much um and if you have spiritual eyes you could see
2:27
this and so Peter could see this and he could speak it and it was also out of a humble place too you know it was saying
2:35
you are above us Lord you know it was lifting up Jesus um and then so but then
2:43
when Peter said do not you will not go on the cross after Jesus Jesus says he
2:49
he will the thing is is that Jesus is actually speaking that he is going to do this jesus is speaking I'm going to go
2:55
on the cross jesus is speaking to his disciples I'm going to do this and for
3:00
Peter to say you will not do that it's really like
3:06
it's really like correcting Jesus like Peter was was really like correcting
3:12
Jesus like he was really he was really thinking in his mind like no like Jesus
3:18
has got it wrong no this can't be jesus has this wrong
3:23
no you know that's that was out of the that was the place it was coming out of now the proper response could have been
3:31
something like "I don't understand what you're saying Jesus can you help me understand more i don't understand at
3:38
all what you're saying and I don't like what you're saying but
3:44
I humble myself you know what you're saying I know is always true Lord and you are my teacher you are my Lord so
3:52
just help me understand I if it's if if it's okay for me to understand this right now or if I'm just
4:00
supposed to just believe without understanding yet okay Lord you you see
4:05
what I mean um yeah so Peter was like
4:10
a little bit prideful in this way i mean a moment of pride a moment of pride to
4:16
be like no Jesus you are not going to do that you know it's just even even the tone of
4:22
him speaking that is not very reverent
4:28
and submissive and humble at that point so that's
4:34
really how to know um that the Lord is leading you to speak something if you
4:41
are you know not just hastily quickly saying something but you are making sure
4:47
that you are humbling yourself and it's aligning with God's principles it's aligning with his word it's aligning
4:54
with what you've heard your teacher your teacher your spiritual leader speak you
5:00
know rather than saying "God is leading me to do this." When you never really hear what you're saying really align
5:08
with what your your spiritual leader has taught
5:15
or was it Peter's own interest not to lose Jesus yes that's what Yeah that's what I was saying like he was saying "No
5:21
I don't want you're not going to go on the cross." He was saying that cuz he didn't want that so he was saying it out of a selfish and prideful place how to
5:30
stop the enemy when he speaks up after a time of spiritual highs you just have to reject him and he must flee very simple
How to Stop the Enemy when he Speaks Up After a Time of Spiritual Highs?
5:36
like a child like a child just just keep doing that and he must flee and you know
5:42
you have to renew your mind that God has lifted me god has brought me these highs
5:49
you know God has has moved so powerfully and the enemy is not happy about it so
5:55
of course he's angry of course he wants to attack now but he does not have the victory and so you just reject him
6:02
reject him keep rejecting him and he has to flee
6:08
renew your mind reject the devil and renew your mind with the truth renew your mind with what God has revealed to
6:13
you with what God has done in your life um to keep your peace and keep your joy
6:19
and not let the devil distract you or take away what God has done
6:27
have you done a teaching on discerning of spirits it seems like you are displaying this as you prophetically
6:32
know which spirits are operating in people as you minister this makes is
6:37
this a new wine way of operating in this spiritual gift
6:44
yes so when a when when it is your calling to like a five-fold minister
6:51
calling for example um it's quite simply that God releases what you need to you
6:57
he releases the prophetic anointing and he releases the authority and
7:04
the prophetic is a beautiful way that reveals God's love and power and how he
7:11
knows his people so much that's one of the the
7:17
purposes of the prophetic is the revealing of God's nearness to a person
7:24
how he knows a person how he how he knows what a person has been tormented with um
7:32
how he knows what a person's been going through um and so ministering
7:37
prophetically that's a big purpose of that prophetic it's so when like when we
7:46
minister prophetically it's not so much that we have to say a
7:53
certain spirit spirit's name and then it will go
8:00
it's more of the opening of spiritual eyes revealing
8:05
how God sees and knows a person and loves a person and it's also a way of walking in authority too
8:13
but like you know in the time like when you think about Peter how simply it was Peter and Paul how people just came
8:20
under the the sha under Peter's shadow and also with Paul they brought the the
8:26
anoint they brought the handkerchiefs and aprons to his skin where that it was anointed the anointing
8:33
got on the cloths put the claws on the people and they were just instantly free and healed so notice how
8:41
Paul didn't have to say "Okay this this anchored handkerchief that goes on my
8:47
skin I declare or I release it." You know he puts his hands on it and he's like he's not like every spirit of
8:55
depression anyone that has depression go lay this on it now he could have done that i'm not saying you can't do he couldn't do that but um what I am saying
9:03
is that the power of the anointing and authority is the power over all demonic spirits and it's so powerful it's so
9:12
authoritative the anointing that just like the demons
9:19
the de when the when it touches the demons they have to go um so like many
9:24
times I will say every spirit attached to what is renown what you what you've just renounced I detach you from every
9:31
spirit i detach you from everything you've renounced and I declare every spirit attached to what you renounce must go so I'm not saying every single
9:39
spirit you know I'm not I'm not saying every single one so
9:45
it's not you know that doesn't that's that does not equal the demon going when you speak it out loud it's not like oh
9:51
no they've said my name and now I have to go it's it's very simple you know like in
9:57
the times of Peter all of the people who were oppressed they were free he didn't
10:02
have to go up to specifically every single person or group people okay
10:07
everyone with depression spirits come in this group here okay now I command every de okay when I walk by you then all the
10:15
depression spirits have to go you know so when you really have the anointing
10:20
and authority demons just go so simply and there's not
10:26
something specific you have to do you just simply have to walk in your authority you simply have to release the
10:31
anointing um some but sometimes God can lead you to use your authority
10:37
differently and that's just how the Holy Spirit's leading like I command these spirits must leave on three that's just
10:44
a different way that God is leading me to exert my authority and so also saying
10:50
you spirit of suicidal thoughts you know saying it by name can be a way of of
10:57
exerting the authority but it's not like oh the demon might not be going because
11:03
the person casting out the demon isn't saying that name it's not like that the prophetic is more of um just revealing
11:12
revealing God's love revealing how God knows revealing his power um that's
11:19
that's the great purpose of the prophetic um and to to yeah to just like
11:25
open up eyes to see how God is so near and he knows
11:32
he knows he knows you
11:39
but it's also used in oper in in walking in authority too it's just not like oh I
11:44
have to say it's not like a religious thing it's not like a religious thing where it's like I have to say the name
11:49
of the spirit for it to leave just like how saying demons must go on
11:56
three is not like I have to do this for the demons to go no it's just how it's just how you're walking in authority how
12:02
Holy Spirit may lead you to walk in authority my mom isn't a full-on believer but I but testified today of things falling
The Power of Serving God
12:08
off of her recently and I believe it's just by me being planted the anointing is so strong yes and you served you
12:17
served a lot at Arise and Shine and many people don't understand the power of serving many many people think that you
12:24
have to have this feeling this where you fall down or something and you have to be like this um you know to to receive
12:33
from God but if you are serving God I I'm a prime example oh my goodness like
12:39
I am constantly serving God there's not a time where I'm like um okay someone
12:45
else go and minister so I can go like this you know but like there's it's just
12:50
a special grace like when you when you're in that place where like there is
12:56
a place of like receiving from God like this like receiving and um you fall back
13:03
and you have those encounters but um then you come to a place where God has truly delivered you and healed you and
13:09
now it's time to serve God and but then you keep receiving from God but it's
13:14
different like before when you needed healing and freedom you're a falling back you may be screaming out demons if
13:21
you need deliverance or coffin it's these like huge physical things
13:27
happening physical supernatural experiences
13:33
that are happening but once you're set free and healed it doesn't mean that you
13:38
never have physical experiences again but they're going to be less and I talk about this I've talked about this a lot
13:45
um I have messages on this um
13:50
I'm forgetting the name but there's one message I preached like a few months ago or so or like half a year ago or so
13:56
where I shared about how many the purpose of coming to church is not to have a physical experience but to
14:04
receive from God not not not not receiving this like physical experience
14:09
that can happen but when you're freed and when you're set free now you come to
14:15
church you come to church to worship God but also to receive the word receive equipping
14:21
to to to to be more matured and stronger and your spiritual eyes opened up but
14:27
receiving that many times doesn't equal like this physical experience but that's the main purpose of going to church um
14:35
for believers believers that are set free and you know now following Jesus
14:41
and walking in his will and being a disciple um and also receiving the anointing as
14:47
it is released which is doing miracles in your life but it doesn't necessarily mean there needs to be a physical
14:53
experience attached to that um right there like the anointing is released you might not feel anything but the
14:59
anointing is going out in your life working on things in your life in the area of finances in the area of your
15:05
physical health in the area of your family members um in the spiritual realm
15:11
it's doing things as it was released upon you and so if you're at the church
15:16
and you're not in a position of serving at that time you know you you have your
15:21
your hands up like this and to receive but if you're playing the piano if you're operating the camera if you are
15:28
doing something maybe you're moderating on the live stream like if you're doing
15:34
something serving wise where you know you can't be like this close your eyes
15:40
with your hands up it does not mean you haven't received that anointing you've received that anointing just as
15:46
powerfully and actually anyone who serves God is receiving the most amount of anointing now I don't mean like I
15:55
don't by by saying that I don't mean like um if you cannot serve at the church
16:01
like that you're planning out in this direct way of like operating the camera or playing the piano that you're missing
16:07
out i don't know i share this often but serving God it it's different in every
16:13
season and the big way that we all serve God is by sharing our testimonies sharing on social media what God is
16:19
doing at the church where you're planted at to share that ministry and and do that every day continually be doing all
16:27
you can to shine your light to lead people to Jesus and lead people to where you have received the power of God so
16:32
that they can receive the power of God as you have that's serving too okay but
16:38
um you know like I just heard this amazing testimony
16:44
that all of a sudden like right now the mom is receiving these miracles i see prophetically it's because you served
16:50
you served at Arise and Shine um you know filming and everything so as you're
16:58
doing that the anointing is coming upon your life powerfully and many people miss this fact they they they don't want
17:04
to serve they want because they think they're going to miss something but actually you're receiving more and so
17:10
I'm a I'm a great example even Jean Tall is a great example um
17:15
I mean just my life her life like my life like I I I I'm never in a place
17:22
where I'm like too bad I have to serve i wish I could
17:28
just receive today because there's things I like really need and so I know
17:35
that as I serve this is how I receive and God takes care of everything in my
17:40
life everything in my life everything and that's the biggest key is serving
17:45
serving you take care of God's business he takes care of your business but we got to get out of that mindset about
17:52
that when you have the physical encounter or when you have the eyes shut and the hands raised that's when you
17:58
receive now it is important to raise our hands when we can don't get me wrong but what I'm trying to say is many people
18:04
when they're serving they think that they're missing out they're seeing other
18:09
people be knocked down by God's power but they don't feel anything and they're busy serving and they think they're
18:16
missing out but God's the one that sent you to serve and because you're serving people are able to receive so how does
18:23
God treat you how is God looking upon you how is he looking at you i mean
18:31
you see what I'm saying like those who laid down their lives to serve God
18:38
the first the last will be first and the first will be last the last will be first the first will be last this even
18:44
happened on the Zoom the Zoom call this this this this Wednesday i mean the Zoom live this gentleman was like
18:51
"Let other people receive," you know and then and then God had him be called on the Zoom for like releasing the
18:58
anointing to him and stuff and so that's how it is when you're serving you're like "I want to help do what I can so
19:03
that everyone can receive." It's not that you're like disqualifying yourself from receiving
19:10
it's that you're being like Jesus you're being you're being like the disciples
19:15
and so the disciples they were receiving the most from God but they were serving people they were focused on serving
19:21
serving people and they received the most and they be being able to be used the most by God um so you got to
19:29
understand how God sees how he sees you how he must take care of you as you're
19:35
you're doing his work i shared this so much at arise and shine um
19:41
at a rise and shine uh I remember sharing this a lot like this
19:48
principle that I'm telling you um that that that many people are missing
19:53
you as you serve God you receive the most you receive the most that's such a big
19:59
key of the life of abundance that I am living in is serving God not serving God
20:04
any old way but serving God in order in order
20:11
serving God it's so important to serve God like like you need to lead people to
20:16
where you are planted that's what everyone should do people that are planted a different church they churches
20:22
they should be leading people to where they are planted because you're leading people to where you have received so you
20:28
know that truly they will meet Jesus here you don't know about other churches so it's better to to you know rather
20:34
than being like follow Jesus and just find a church wherever
20:39
it's not good to do that really because like you don't know they don't they're a
20:45
baby they don't know they don't you don't want to just say any church and then they they go to religion and old
20:50
wine you know so it's it's like where you have received from where you have
20:56
tasted the fruit lead them to where you have tasted the fruit this is how we build the kingdom because every believer
21:04
needs to be planted in a church where God has anointed them to be planted every believer and that is how they
21:11
receive total freedom in that place because the anointing is flowing upon their lives and they have a spiritual
21:17
pro spiritual covering over their life protection and they are equipped and receive
21:22
impartation to be who God called them to be a powerful vessel of God so that's how we build the church that's how we
21:29
build the kingdom of God that's how we build the army to be strong instead of just a bunch of babies that are in old
21:36
wine that are lukewarm that are deceived by the angel of light that are lost and
21:41
can't help bringing the harvest cuz everybody's babies you see um so serving
21:48
God correctly serving God in order um serving God where you are planted i'm
21:56
telling you it you can test God in this you see how
22:03
you you you will be shocked by the miracles you experience in your life by the abundant i mean even just like the
22:09
flow of grace that's what I experience serving God i just experience the flow of grace every day where I don't I don't
22:16
even I don't want for anything i don't need just a flow of grace a a continual
22:22
abundance continual health continual just peace and joy but it's because of
22:29
serving God continually and focusing on that
22:34
and I I share this because I know with all my heart this is not because I'm some special person that that God has
22:43
more favor for or something and because I have this big calling different
22:48
calling like what I'm talking about specifically right now the abundant life I experience I know with all my heart
22:55
that this is what God wants for everybody that everybody can have this
23:01
when you serve God when you surrender Wonder this is for everybody
23:07
hallelujah hallelujah
23:12
what is the best thing to do if you are struggling with weight loss and eating healthy um okay so to so bring this to
What is the Best Thing to do if You are Struggling with Weight Loss and Eating Healthy?
23:18
God renounce anything you need to renounce like um gluttony uh renouncing
23:27
uh eating food that is not good for your body um and then just bring it to God
23:32
and tell God "Lord I want to eat more healthy i know you want this for me um I
23:37
know you want me at a healthier weight and so I need your help Lord um
23:44
h give me the strength give me the power give me the discipline the self-control
23:49
lord invite him to help you." And then renew your mind that you are a new creation your flesh has been crucified
23:55
with Jesus your old your old your old body your old nature has been crucified
24:01
and renew your mind that you can do all things through Christ and that this
24:06
right now is a matter of since you're where the power of God is and you've renounced you received the if it if it
24:13
was a demon you've already received the anointing to free you well I'm speaking to you to the person who wrote this i'm
24:20
I'm speaking because I know she's been here it would be different if someone is is it's their first time you know i
24:26
would say I would say this must leave you now but if you've been here for a while you can know that the anointing is
24:34
washing over you has come over you there's no demonic oppression there
24:39
it's you it just it's just a matter of self-control and you can do it and discipline and you can do it and um
24:47
just don't do anything religiously just do it with excitement like I am following God in this god wants God's
24:53
pleased with me in doing this i can do this and you can even start like a little at a time instead of um you know
25:03
it doesn't need to be something so extremely extremely um
25:11
drastic but just just try to incorporate it little
25:16
by little try to incorporate um more healthier foods like replacing
25:22
um non-healthy foods for healthy foods little by little and
25:30
this is it's like a it's like a lifestyle change that's why I'm saying um to not do it like religiously and
25:36
drastically because that might that could make it harder on yourself unnecessarily um but just start to
25:43
incorporate it and your body will adapt um like I know I know from experience
25:51
like I I started like many many years ago I started to not eat as much sugar
25:58
like I just made that decision but I wasn't like I wasn't like um religious
26:03
about it and like cold turkey about it but I just like decided to I decided to
26:09
buy like more healthy things and not as like I just made that decision to not
26:14
buy it cuz then it wouldn't be in the home and then I found that like I start it's
26:22
like almost like your physical body actually adapts too so it's like it's spiritual and physical so sometimes it's
26:27
like but sometimes we're like thinking is so spiritual but sometimes it's like physical it's just it's just a you like
26:33
your taste buds are like used to oh like think in your mind even is like in this
26:40
routine of like craving something and and eating it um to crave something
26:46
doesn't mean it's like an addiction you know so sometimes it's just like what your body's used to and so I remember I
26:53
would I just made the choice to eat less sugar and but I wasn't like a diet about
26:58
it like I'm on a diet i wasn't like drastic about it but I just like made that choice and then I found that my
27:04
taste buds changed or my brain and my taste buds changed or something like over like I couldn't eat super sweet
27:11
things anymore it would gross me out it was just like that's too sweet and I was never that way before and I would just
27:17
be like that's that's too sweet and I would still like other sweet things it's not like I I was opposed to anything
27:23
sweet but like the really kind of sweet things it was like gh my taste buds like change in like a good way
27:31
and now I find like I used to I used to eat burgers whenever I would like eat
27:38
out i would like want to have a burger not that I would eat out that much it was only like once every two weeks or
27:44
something like that but I would be like "Ooh a burger." But then I started like making the choice to just like whenever
27:51
I was home to eat healthy like salads with um chicken on it but like good
27:57
salad dressing and and strawberries and um uh candied pecans i love those and
28:04
some cheese and some avocado and like it so colorful and it was really yummy it
28:10
didn't it feel like oh I'm eating something I'm eating a salad it felt like yummy and my my stomach would feel
28:17
like satisfied and like healthy instead of like heavy and then but when I would
28:22
have like burgers in the past my stomach would feel like heavy and sometimes like indigestion you know and um but you I
28:30
would just like brush it off like oh it's okay it's no big deal but then once I made that intention of like eating
28:36
healthy but in a but in a yummy way even like salmon not just like plain salmon but like a sauce with the salmon or
28:43
things like things like this you know so once I started doing that then I like didn't even want crave a burger anymore
28:50
if I was eating out and I and it I would just like like how my my stomach felt like with eating healthy food like I
28:57
just I naturally liked it but it was so cool because it was like this gradual lifestyle change um where it like where
29:06
it's like now I eat really healthy but it was never like I'm going on this extreme diet and it's like I'm making
29:11
myself suffer and this kind of reminds me of like what I've been sharing actually about life
29:17
with the Holy Spirit is that sometimes like we think that abundant life is so
29:24
like hard to receive and to receive like peace and joy and abundant life with God
29:31
and healthiness and everything is like so hard to have and we have to fast so
29:36
much and we have to make all these heavy sacrifices but really like what I found is I've made like serious sacrifices
29:45
but only sacrifices God led me to make um not sacrifices like like
29:55
every single thing like um like uh
30:00
I cannot so I have to make this sacrifice where I I I can't have my
30:06
dream of singing i can't have a dream of having a house right now now I can't have a dream of being married and having
30:11
children right now and I also need to make the sacrifice not eat any kind of sugar and have any coffee and and watch
30:17
anything on the TV and you know that's so much religion where
30:23
people like think that God doesn't want you to he wants you to live some like drastic
30:31
life of sacrificing things unnecessarily when you live in that religious mindset
30:38
it's a trap of sin it's a trap of sin you're like do trying
30:43
to do these extreme sacrifices maybe it's an extreme diet or an extreme fast that God didn't call you to do and
30:50
because God didn't call you to do it it's out of his will out of his grace out of his grace and when you're doing
30:56
things like this that's the religion way where they never could match up they could never achieve all the laws right
31:02
that they were called to do that's like how you're living um but like like for
31:08
me for example like I like eat healthy i have so much self-control with like eating um I would say and um and
31:18
exercise too like I used to I remember in college I hated to run i would go to the gym on the treadmill and it was like
31:25
it was horrible and it felt like I should work out it was so heavy now it's my favorite thing to do because I like
31:32
to be outside and I like to go on hikes but I found something to do but many people are like thinking God's like "You
31:38
need to go to the gym for 2 hours a day when God's not saying that you know."
31:44
And so for me I'm like I found I love nature i love to hike or even go for a jog sometime and it's like so sunny
31:50
outside and I found a street that has a lot of greenery and so like I enjoy
31:55
jogging now and like the joy I experience of like the fact that it's not this heavy thing where God's like
32:02
you need to run today like like that but instead I don't
32:08
I don't hear that i'm not seeing God that way so now I have like energy and
32:13
joy to exercise i I I'm living in grace with the Holy Spirit instead of religion
32:19
so now I have I have like so much energy to run where running isn't even like hard like it's fun and I feel like yeah
32:26
like like when we're at church and we can't help but dancing but to dance and
32:31
jump where's the energy come from the joy of the Holy Spirit in our lives and
32:37
so like for me like exercising is like not heavy at all but for a lot of people exercising is so heavy so it's like they
32:46
dread it i look forward to it but it's because I'm I'm not doing it out of religion i'm not having any kind of
32:52
religion in my life so I have so much joy and strength of the Holy Spirit in my life so this be this thing becomes an
32:58
easy part of my life to do hallelujah hallelujah yeah so like even like eat
33:05
like I eat healthy i have self-control but that didn't come from like an extreme fast or an extreme diet that now
33:11
I have that that I mean that now I have that like kind of self-control you know um
33:19
we make things too hard on ourselves when God's not God God is like saying "I
33:24
want you to eat healthy i want you to take care of your body i want you to exercise." But he's not doing it in this
33:29
like like stern religious way and so if we can just see like God
33:37
saying like it's good to do these things and hey you can have fun doing them and you can enjoy them you can enjoy eating healthy like you can find delicious
33:45
healthy things and you know you can exercise and it can be enjoyable it can be fun go find where it's fun you know
33:52
if you can see God like that then it becomes not heavy to do these things
33:57
easy and fun and this is kind of what I'm trying to share part of of like
34:02
life with the Holy Spirit is full of joy and peace and it's not heavy
34:07
hallelujah wow I don't know why The comment is
34:13
cutting off partly but I like this testimony from Patricia after Rise and Shine I've had so much energy to
34:19
exercise and get outside to walk and enjoy nature just about every day and I wanted and I want to do it versus how
34:25
hard it was before and like a chore yes see see the key to being able to have
34:32
the strength to do everything that God wants you to do
34:39
is being free of religion and seeing his love accurately as you see his love accurately you receive so much joy the
34:46
joy of the Lord is your strength the joy of the Lord is your strength
34:53
and I experience I have I I I I get like seven to eight hours of sleep every day
34:58
when I can and every single one of those days I have so much energy
35:05
like I don't feel tired anytime during those days and on a day that I can't get as much sleep of course as a human I'll
35:11
feel tired but then if I have to like do something if I have to preach I have so much energy to do like what I am when I
35:18
have to do it because that joy is everlasting that joy is continual in my
35:23
life the joy of the Lord so I'm continually having this supernatural strength
35:30
can we do boxing if it's not with other people just on a bag i don't know if it was a religious spirit telling me I'm not allowed to do that because it's
Can We Do Boxing If It's Not with Other People?
35:36
boxing i used to love doing it it was fun yeah i mean um to to work out your
35:41
your arms we have weights but push-ups but also these these movements
35:48
well you know if you are looking at the punching bag and thinking I am putting
35:53
my anger towards this person right now pretending it's this person then I would not I would not do that but if you're
36:00
doing it literally in an I mean sometimes I would be going down I would um be exercising um on my jog and I
36:07
would be doing different I'm like "How can I work out my arms right now?" And I would I would go like this like just
36:12
moving my arms in that kind of way so like that's fine if you're just doing it like just to exercise to build strength
36:20
in your arms that's fine but if you have a mentality of um getting rage out then
36:27
I would do a different exercise of for the arms
36:32
do different people need different amounts of sleep i've always had eight and a half hours but I want to sleep eight so I have extra time in the day
Do Different People Need Different Amounts of Sleep?
36:39
yeah i mean like scientifically which you know science is like can show us
36:45
these things sometimes like for example like how to eat health like how foods
36:51
affect us like that's something that we that's like good for us to know you know like from science right so even also
36:57
with sleep and I remember like seeing that it's like most people need 7 to I
37:03
think 7 to eight or 7 to n hours of sleep so yeah and I mean Like I find
37:10
that if I have like eight or seven I usually like don't feel tired at all
37:17
sometimes with six sometimes I would feel a little tired you know but like I you know you kind of can notice that on
37:22
yourself i think it's different for everybody like the exact amount of the sweet spot
37:27
but um of course there's days where you just can't get that amount maybe if you're traveling or something if the
37:34
flight's early things like that and then God gives you strength and energy you might not naturally feel as energetic
37:39
the other days but that's okay that's it's just part of our life and it's okay and God gives us strength but um if
37:46
you're noticing that you need eight eight and a half I would say you you could probably go with a little bit less
37:51
with the with God's strength so just you can just try it and and see and and just
37:58
reject any thoughts of like your past life thinking that you need more
38:03
but you also don't have to be like like it's okay to get more sleep if if that's
38:10
what you need you know after Rise and Shine I've had more non-believers wanting to spend time with
How to Discern If It's Led By the Holy Spirit to Spend Time with Non Believers?
38:17
me and have had shared about struggles in their life how to discern if it's led by the Holy Spirit to spend time with
38:23
them so if you're spending time with these people you need to know that you're on a mission and you're on
38:29
assignment you are not there to be friends with them like on the same level as them to
38:34
hang out and um you need to be discerning to see if this person um how
38:43
they're seeing you they should like if
38:49
if someone you know if someone is reaching out noticing that like through what you're posting um
38:58
they they see that that that that that that you have something that they don't have and they want that and they're kind
39:04
of showing that by how they speak that's an indicator that this is a time this is
39:09
something you can make time for but you need to have boundaries you don't need to be spending a whole day with someone or a whole half of a day with somebody
39:16
just to plant seeds for Jesus it's not going to take that long you know like you need to give them this message about
39:24
what you've received your testimony that Jesus can deliver them can heal them
39:30
about his power and leave it at that you don't need to um
39:37
overextend yourself when God's not asking you to do that um because the
39:42
enemy can you got to you got to really walk in that wisdom because people who are not fully surrendered the enemy can
39:48
use them so it's you really just have to walk in this wisdom and discernment because you can't just shut yourself off
39:54
to people just because you know oh if they're not surrendered to God then the devil can use them so I just shut myself off then you're not being the light in
40:00
the world you're not being the light to the people that God is calling you to be the light to but you it you really have
40:07
to be careful that you that the devil is not draining you through them is not
40:13
using this person um to to you know there's so many burdens you're not
40:19
called to carry but it's more just for you to direct them to where you have received watch you know you don't you
40:26
don't need to feel like you need to become their counselor that you need to listen on to them to all their problems for like many hours on the phone because
40:33
these types of things you're not you don't have the grace the anointing the the growth the maturity yet to
40:40
handle this and God's just not calling you to handle all that burden of a person but Jesus can handle that as he's
40:46
moving in power through the screen in person to where you're directing them so
40:51
um definitely be open to now people reaching out to you um and moments where
40:58
you can share about Jesus and your testimony with them but you have to see it as an assignment like not blur the
41:06
lines of like friendship and hanging out and it should be short it doesn't need to be long you you delivered the message
41:14
and that's that and then now it's up to them um yeah
41:20
because if a person really wants help like because if a person really wants help then they will receive the help
41:26
from you of like you you directing them come receive watch online for example
41:31
come in person you know that's your part and that if they really want help they're going to be grateful and they're
41:37
going to listen to you and they're going to come receive that help but then there's some people that will be manipulative they see that you have so
41:44
much passion for Jesus so much passion for the power of God deliverance so maybe they can start you know speaking
41:52
something that is acting like they want help kind of thing or they're interested
41:57
but it's like the enemy is actually using them to drain you and um distract
42:03
you um so you really just have to and you'll be able to tell you know you'll be able to tell you just have to trust
42:11
trust God giving you that discernment and wisdom and the biggest the most important thing
42:17
to do is just to make sure you put those boundaries up to for you to know God is not going to ever lead me to like spend
42:27
all these hours with someone because I'm not Jesus
How to Manage Aging with Makeup and Beauty Products with Wisdom?
42:33
i can't like I God's calling me to direct them to how
42:38
they can receive that's my job and it's up to them if they really want
42:44
that help how to manage aging with makeup and modern-day beauty products and
42:50
techniques without conforming to the ways of the world or being misled by the angel of light in this area i mean
42:57
really it's just about it's just it's like if you are not
43:02
idolizing it then that's it's fine to do
43:08
and I mean our appearance whether it's hair clothes
43:15
women for makeup it's for the glory of God it's for the
43:21
glory of God so to you know what I mean like my hair could
43:27
look disheveled right now i you know I could have just not cared about my hair and it looks disheveled
43:34
and it could be a distraction from what I'm saying
43:39
so that's one reason why I put effort for like my hair for example um well just in
43:47
looks in general but also to be the light of the world to to just
43:56
care about how I look not for the glory of God like to put to put care to put
44:02
care of like to see that it it it matters like being
44:09
presentable to to see that it matters to have excellence in the area of
44:15
appearance not in a way that's obsessive or that's like you know spending so much
44:23
time so much money not like that but just like knowing also like how well
44:29
number one everything's beautiful in heaven like like to the eyes physically
44:35
beautiful there's like there's gemstones everywhere gold like it's going to be
44:40
physically beautiful it's not going to look like bland and like God made it
44:47
look real pretty so um part of it and he's royal so we
44:53
should be royalty on this earth um not that we have to like literally look like
45:00
world's royalty not like spending tons of money i don't mean that but there is
45:05
an aspect of God where he has where he likes beauty beauty you know and I mean
45:12
the most important beauty is from within of course but um every part of our lives
45:18
like our appearance can it shouldn't be disheveled number one because that's a distraction and on on this earth there's
45:26
like um we live on this earth so we you know how Paul says be like the culture
45:32
so that I become like the culture so that people will receive my message
45:39
and So basically he's saying he's he's not doing anything distracting
45:48
he's fitting in fitting in in a way that's not compromising his morals that's not he's not talking about like compromising the morals like adapting to
45:56
culture in that regard he's talking about like doing cultural things that are not sin sinful that's what he's
46:02
talking about doing cultural things that are not sinful um so and that's like how
46:10
people just people see so so like if you if you think about
46:16
today if you are presentable like um
46:21
when you get a when you go to a job interview it's important you look presentable like that will affect
46:27
whether you'll get hired or not if you look presentable so that's just that's just an example it's like a normal
46:33
standard where if you're like put together people have more respect people
46:39
may take you more seriously it can if you're looking disheveled it probably
46:45
people will see that in your life or even if you it's looking like you don't care what you look like um like you
46:52
don't give care you're just like I don't care whatever um people can think that
46:57
that's what your every part of your life is like you know what I'm saying so there is this worldly
47:07
like societal it's like a it's like how society works is what I'm trying to say so um if we
47:16
are presentable and we give care to our appearance not obsessing but that it
47:22
that it's we want to look presentable and not distracting and we want people to listen to what we have to say to have
47:30
like respect you know um then that's helping our light to shine more our
47:36
light is from within not outwardly but it's like helping our light to shine
47:41
more and not detract not tuck away not take away not keep people from receiving
47:48
our light you see so it's like it's like wisdom
47:54
it's like having wisdom and seeing you know this is how people think this
47:59
is how society works if you if you present yourself well then a person will
48:07
respect and listen to what you have to say more um and will like take you more
48:12
seriously type thing yeah so that was a big explanation on why on like how to
48:18
think about things like makeup and that can be like clothes and hair too of course um
48:25
so yeah so as long as you are not um obsessing over it and you're thinking
48:31
like I need this to look pretty otherwise I don't look pretty i can't leave the house without
48:39
my makeup because you know as long as it's not that then it's absolutely fine
48:45
to like wear makeup
48:50
since I've planted myself at 5F I've stopped crying i used to cry all the time but when is it okay to cry
48:57
well that's because the joy of the Lord is more of a smile and laughter type of
49:04
thing than crying um so crying uh I find
49:10
like for me I will cry with joy sometimes or just in awe it
49:16
won't be a lot but it'll be certain moments where the faithfulness of God God does
49:23
something where I'm just overwhelmed by his faithfulness and his goodness and
49:28
his love i find sometimes I'll find it coming like if I've waited for something for so long and then a promise is
49:35
fulfilled type thing or something like that like that moment um
49:41
that moment at the Q&A session I remember was a specific moment where
49:48
there were tears um it was just like the faithfulness of God
49:53
coming like what he had spoken um what he had spoken of the year of acceptance
49:58
you know um and amidst all the attacks how he is faithful and he brings us
50:07
victory that was the moment I remember actually it was the impartation session
50:12
of last year where I just saw
50:18
spiritually these precious hearts who received God and so many didn't so many
50:25
rejected him but there were many that I got to see like never before physically in one place who truly received Jesus
50:32
and his move and it was emotional because it was like
50:38
I've waited for that for so long and went through so much persecution and so
50:43
much of seeing of people rejecting people rejecting so I remember that was an emotional moment um
50:51
yeah and I mean like for I remember for me um
50:58
there would be like just not many tears but there was a couple probably like a
51:03
total of just a handful of days over the years that I waited for the promise
51:10
of revival and the tears were just like because it was hard to wait because it
51:16
was it was difficult it felt difficult to wait but it was it was just that feeling the
51:24
the pain of the waiting type thing um but and yeah and other times just some
51:31
I've noticed like sometimes one time like when
51:38
just seeing someone do something so evil being used by the devil Pharisees that
51:45
sometimes like it's painful so that that's it can happen and it's okay it's totally okay but what you shouldn't do
51:51
is to lean into the crying like um
51:57
like like if you if you cry in those moments
52:02
where it's hard because it's hard um you don't don't lean into that just like
52:09
it's okay that it happened it's not like a bad thing to cry because we're human and it's like Jesus he cried when um
52:16
Lazarus died but he knew he was going to raise him from the grave but it was like it was sadness you know it was painful
52:24
in that moment it was painful that he died and also that his um
52:32
Mary and Martha his sisters were in so much pain so much sorrow that he loved
52:38
them so that was also like a painful it's a painful moment of like tears you know but
52:45
he didn't he didn't wallow in those tears he didn't sit in those tears he went and rose him from the grave he
52:51
renewed his mind with the truth so like tears can come sometimes as humans and
52:57
that's okay that's totally okay it's never anything to like feel like bad about or something but God doesn't want
53:05
you to stay in a place of being sad he wants you to renew your mind and um
53:11
remember that he is faithful and that this too shall pass and it's just temporary um weeping may endure for the
53:19
night but joy comes in the morning so don't let the weeping endure too long
53:26
yeah so
53:31
but if you're not crying much that's not like a bad sign or anything um
53:39
because the joy of the Lord is so the joy of the Lord is so strong in your life that for most people it's not going
53:45
to be crying much just in like like once in a while
53:52
my parents have the most beautiful hearts their hearts are so beautiful um
53:58
they're so beautiful like I love them like equally so much and they have the
54:04
heart of Jesus so much but in unique different ways but
54:10
um my dad will cry so easily and it's so beautiful and when he cries it's really
54:16
really really beautiful um because it's just it's a pure cry and it's it's like
54:23
when something is emotional like maybe people sharing testimony at 5F for example um or
54:31
I wrote something in my first book that I gave him i think you saw the video some of you at Christmas time and it
54:36
just touched him but like my mom doesn't cry as easily doesn't cry like my dad
54:42
like it's so different but like her heart is so beautiful her heart is so
54:48
beautiful so um I just wanted to share that because I think sometimes maybe
54:53
people think that like if a person immediately cries in terms of like um
55:00
like like if someone doesn't cry very easily but they feel in their heart like wow Jesus you're so good or they're just
55:07
they're touched or they have compassion for a person they don't cry but they feel that in their heart and then
55:13
another person they may see like crying so easily and like they can compare
55:18
compare themselves like what's wrong with me so I just wanted to say that like we're just built differently in
55:25
terms of like crying with emotion like our tears attached to like our heart
55:31
it's different for everybody so I just wanted to say that because you shouldn't ever compare yourself in that way um but
55:38
just let it come natural
55:43
thank you Jesus for what you have done thank you Jesus for what you have done today this has been such an amazing
55:49
powerful live i want to pray over all of you right now thank you Jesus i declare
55:56
right now that any any area of heaviness that you've been having any area that's
56:04
kept you from having joy any area of religiousness mindset
56:09
um shame condemnation um deceit of the angel of light it must go from you completely now in Jesus'
56:15
name anything keeping you from shining your light any old way thinking
56:21
religious way thinking it must go from your life completely and I declare now
56:26
that every every spirit of heaviness depression sickness must go in Jesus'
56:35
name i declare this anointing to come upon you now the fire of the Holy Spirit
56:40
to come upon you now and let this fire increase in your life let this joy of the Lord increase in your life may the
56:47
joy of the Lord be your strength may this joy increase every day this is how
56:53
you experience the most intimacy with Jesus this is how you're able to receive his love and therefore show him love
57:00
show him love back the most is when your eyes you can you can reject the devil's
57:06
lies and renew your mind with the truth so your eyes can continually see God's
57:11
love rightly so you can overflow that love to the world so you can have the joy of the Lord as your strength and
57:17
have so much strength and so much joy to give to the people to serve people to
57:23
give to to to shine your light hallelujah hallelujah and so may nothing
57:30
take what you have received the words that I have shared today but also in the past the many teachings teaching you how
57:37
to follow the Holy Spirit how God's heart really is his character really is how to be free of religion what's the
57:44
devil's voice the angel of light's voice versus God's voice all of these teachings that you have received in the past and everything may nothing take
57:51
