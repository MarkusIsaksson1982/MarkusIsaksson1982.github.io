in the Bible it says so a man thinketh so is he as a man thinketh so is he or
0:06
man or woman what about the thoughts the enemy is constantly putting in someone's head
0:12
that are that they are rejecting those thought thoughts aren't them right
0:18
correct correct so we don't have control
0:23
of what thoughts the devil may want to put in our minds like when when a person
0:30
is free is set free from demonic oppression in the mind the devil can
0:36
still bring thoughts in the mind not that the a demon from within is making
0:42
the thoughts come but the Bible says that no weapon formed
0:47
against you shall prosper so weapons being formed against you can many times
0:54
look like thoughts the devil plants in your mind so
1:01
um it's not like we naturally get to think whatever we
1:07
want and you know that we have complete control
1:14
there we we we do have we do gain control as we grow in the spiritual
1:20
realm as we grow spiritually and keep resisting the devil we keep it's like um
1:27
it's kind of like if if an intruder was to knock on your door and the first
1:34
time he this Intruder may be enticing tempting of the world and you are
1:40
curious and you want to hear what he has to say um why he's so passionate about
1:45
coming into your house and so you invite him in you invite him in you take a chance he sits down and speaks more
1:54
things um worldly things okay and then he goes
2:00
and like if if he the Intruder keeps on coming in like meaning like someone
2:06
that's of no good no good motives is coming to bring bad and harm to you
2:12
maybe in a manipulating way knocks on your door so let's say you befriend this person you keep letting him come in the
2:19
house so that's the action of the devil bringing thoughts in your mind and you
2:25
agreeing with them and not rejecting them you agreeing with them you you
2:30
agree with them by meditating on them and also speaking
2:35
them um so you're that that's the action of a green okay so but then there might
2:42
come a point where you realize this Intruder knocking on the door uh is an
2:48
intruder that it is not safe it is not wise to let this Intruder into your home
2:54
so he may knock on the door you may open the door and say no no you can't come in
3:01
I don't want you here well he may come back and knock on the door again I mean you did let him in before so he he's
3:08
going to keep trying you may open up the door and you you'll say no again I don't want you to come in my
3:14
place he may knock on the door later on and then you mean now now you're really meaning serious business you are you're
3:22
caring about the safety of your home the safety of yourself and the safety of your home you're you're meaning serious
3:28
business where before you didn't mean that mean serious business you were being risky and um
3:34
uh um naive but now you're not even opening the door when he knocks now you
3:40
look at the peepole and you say I'm not even giving him the time of the day I'm making it known that he I will never let
3:46
him in here So eventually that Intruder will will give up will stop
3:54
even coming to the door and knocking that's a metaphor an analogy of
4:00
what it's like in the spiritual realm like we we don't get to control who
4:07
knocks on our door but we can control who we allow to come into our
4:12
home we don't we don't get to control what thoughts may try to implant
4:19
themselves into our into our mind we don't have control over what thoughts may pass our minds by the enemy trying
4:24
to bring these thoughts in but we we do have control over if if we will allow
4:31
them to stay or if we will kick them out so it's like that you know and so a
4:37
lot of people they feel guilty just because the Intruder is knocking on the door you're not letting
4:44
them in don't feel guilty it's when you let the Intruder in that you have sinned that you have
4:51
failed you know the test which it's okay even if you have failed you can repent
4:57
and God will strengthen you so still don't feel shame but there's so
5:02
many people that are feeling shameful over their thoughts but you you don't realize if you don't want those thoughts
5:09
to go and if you are rejecting them it's the same as you not even opening up the door to the Intruder you the Intruder is
5:16
still knocking on the door you can't control that stop beating yourself up for the Intruder that's knocking at your
5:22
door that you can't control so as a man thinketh so he is so
5:27
if you let the Intruder in and come inside then that's you as a person who's
5:34
letting this Intruder in and and not caring about their health and their safety not caring that that Intruder
5:41
might do harm to your family to yourself to your home May steal some things on their way
5:47
out that's you but if you do not open up the door then that's you you care about
5:56
you value yourself your family your home you value the protection of yourself
6:02
your home and your family you see so um as a man thinketh
6:09
so he is a man or woman really that's the meaning of that scripture
6:15
is the thoughts that you're choosing to stay and the thoughts that you are
6:20
meditating on and the thoughts that then you were then speaking so um that's what it means to
6:29
to your thoughts that you're choosing to have uh if they're coming from the enemy
6:35
are the ones only that you aren't rejecting that you're stewing on meditating on and then act and acting on
6:42
all of those count as as a man thinketh so he is so if you're choosing to meditate on this and you're not
6:48
rejecting it then yes as a man thinketh so is that man or
6:53
woman so if a fearful thought comes in and you are meditating on it you're not
6:59
rejecting it you are meditating meditating meditating maybe you haven't even spoken the the the word of I am
7:07
afraid but if you are allowing that thought to stay meditating on it then as
7:13
you are what that thought is you are you are an afraid man or woman you are a
7:20
fearful man or woman that's your choice that's not who God says you are that's not what God wants you to be but you
7:26
have the choice to be who God called you to be or be whoever you want to be what the enemy wants you to be how you choose
7:33
to think now now if you think if you think I am a beloved child of God and I
7:39
am I I have authority in Christ and I have Victory with Christ and I'm who God
7:47
called me to be in my case I an apostle no matter what people say that I'm not
7:52
no matter what people say about me I even though I'm a woman like whatever they want to say but I in my mind I
7:59
think I choose to think and meditate and believe in the truth of what God Said I
8:05
am an apostle I am a beloved child of God I do have authority of Christ these promises that I'm a child who has all
8:11
these promises that are going to come to pass they are going to come to pass so therefore I am that person therefore I
8:18
am an apostle therefore I I I'm an apostle who has Authority in Christ I a Victorious child of God I'm a beloved
8:25
child of God and I am I am a child of God who has
8:30
promises that will come to pass and I will see the promises come to pass because of what I've thought on of the
8:36
truth that I've thought on but if you're not thinking I don't know about these promises if they'll really come to pass
8:41
I don't know we'll wait and see I don't know as a man thinketh as a woman man thinketh so is he or she you may not see
8:48
those promises come to pass if you're not thinking in other words believing in
8:53
the truth if I still cry when I watch deliverances or healings am I still being delivered myself
9:00
crying comes at different times crying can be just emotions crying can be
9:07
um compassion it can be the heart of Christ
9:12
Heart Of God heart of Christ in you seeing another person and feeling God's heart feeling
9:20
God's heart for them and Jesus even in the Bible it says
9:25
Jesus wept so um sometimes it can truly just be the heart of God in you if you're
9:31
watching healing and deliverance it can be you are taking over of emotion of the
9:37
beauty of Christ of the goodness of God I mean I I don't know how you can't watch deliverance and healing with a
9:44
humble heart at least of your heart and not have more revelation of God's love every time and his faithfulness at least
9:51
we should we shouldn't disvalue what God's doing but if you can be
9:56
present and and and watch someone be delivered and healed you will gain more revelation of
10:03
God's love and God's faithfulness and that is emotional in a beautiful way
10:08
most times many times as our eyes open up to more of God's goodness and faithfulness tears come tears of joy
10:15
tears are just emotion like oh I can't even
10:20
contain the feeling of love that I feel that even tears must come you know um
10:27
so that can be what's happening when you're watching healing or Deliverance but sometimes
10:33
tears can come tears can come even just sometimes when you're in an emotional state of life you could be I know when
10:39
you're going through valleys when you're going through a stretching time of God
10:45
you're more emotional you're more you can just anything can make you cry you can just be easily easily tears
10:53
can come other times um many people as they're being delivered there's
11:00
tears many times it can be the Demonic Spirit even um like manifesting through a person and
11:08
that's what the crying is like demons are very upset when they're being
11:13
confronted by the anointing and being expelled um they are like safe and
11:20
comfortable in a vessel and fulfilling their assignment from the devil in the vessel in a person and when they are
11:28
being sent out they're losing their home they're losing their they're
11:34
failing in their assignment and the fire of God is coming
11:39
upon them and it's not comfortable it's not pleasant and um for the for the
11:48
demons and they also know the Wrath of the devil is will come to
11:54
them for failing because at the end of the day that person decided to go to church
12:01
decided to go position themselves where the anointing is for example um and so the the demons won the
12:07
moment that the person made it to church the demons won the moment the person made a choice to surrender to
12:14
God um so sometimes it can be a demon literally crying through a person it
12:20
looks like the person's crying so so when sometimes sometimes when a person's watching deliverance and they're crying
12:27
it could be the the demon manifesting inside crying as they come
12:36
out and then other times it it doesn't mean demons manifest different ways and they don't always manifest so sometimes
12:44
a person can feel the power of God delivering them and maybe they're not
12:51
sensing any kind of manifestation of a demon but they just sense the power of
12:56
God and they sense that that they have been freed and with that comes the person's
13:04
tears of relief of joy of of just so much emotion of love for
13:12
God uh gr gratitude for God and in awe of God um so that could be it too it can
13:18
be many different things um but uh you don't need to really try to like deeply
13:23
figure it out but with what I shared you can know kind of what's Happening
13:29
when you find tears coming as you're watching Deliverance holy spirit will lead you to discern like what's going on
13:36
that it's your own emotions or you're being delivered Etc if a job is making
13:42
you feel drained and stressed is it a sign to look for a new job many times
13:48
yes I cannot say every single time though because God can use all sorts of
13:53
different things to uh stretch us and and I can totally tell you that
14:02
in times of ministry times in my calling like especially when I've gone
14:08
through through through persecution spiritual warfare times where the devil strategically attacked to try to stop me
14:15
to try to Slow Me Down um during all of those times I definitely felt as a human
14:23
the feelings the emotions even physically of stressed and
14:29
drained um absolutely so we don't get to like avoid those going through those
14:37
things just because we follow Jesus when God takes us through hard times that's
14:43
part of the hard times sometimes to stretch us even as we are not um you
14:49
know putting our mind and thoughts and words on the negative because as you do those things it makes you more drained
14:55
and more stressed but I I found that even even just going through something hard going through something traumatic
15:03
going through I mean I've dealt the biggest thing that I've dealt with has been fares and so like when you think
15:08
about the Pharisees how they treated Jesus it's really shocking and traumatic you know it's really if you think about
15:14
the disciples for them to witness um I mean one day Jesus is is doing these
15:22
great Miracles amazing Miracles and um so many people thousands really belied
15:28
that it's real that Jesus is real that the Miracles are real that Jesus is the
15:35
son of God and then like the next second there's this huge other group of people
15:43
that think the opposite and um that's it's quite jarring and
15:49
shocking and honestly just painful uh to go through for it must have been for the
15:56
disciples and of course for Jesus um so like for me personally that's been
16:03
the times where I've found the it's it's it's heavy it's you're go you're you're
16:08
going through something dramatic and um shocking um like the like the level of
16:16
uh of uh evil shocking and like the times in the Bible when we see all of a sudden David being chased down like he
16:23
wasn't given warning of that uh Joseph how he was thrown in the pit how he was
16:28
thrown in the prison he wasn't giving warning of that so the ways when persecution would come when you read in
16:34
the Bible it's um it's quite shocking and like
16:40
traumatic for the Servants of God going through it because God doesn't warn them
16:45
because he wants to I mean that's part of the the stretching part of the the test of faith so um so yeah so I can't
16:55
tell you that it always means that because sometimes God can use your job
17:01
and something stretching and difficult you're going through as a way to to
17:07
refine you to test you so you really have to follow the holy spirit with that
17:13
you know not run from remember remember how I shared a couple weeks ago at 5f church that the will of God is not
17:19
always fun and is not always comfortable and that is not just talking about Ministry alone that can be like
17:27
the will of God for anything the will of God at the job you're at right now so
17:32
you have to walk in that discernment and and follow the leading of the Holy Spirit um of whether this is
17:40
a but as I shared in the beginning of this answer many times it is it is an
17:47
indication it's time to look for something different because um I shared in a message a few months ago it's
17:54
called I think it's called the image of God made in the or made in the the image of God but I shared the importance of
18:01
making our own decisions on things like like we don't have to like when it comes
18:06
like getting dressed as long as it's not something demonic we're putting on our bodies we can make the choice like we
18:14
don't God should I wear this purple shirt or this blue shirt like God in these situations wants us to use the
18:21
mind he's given us that's made in His image and make choices make good wise
18:29
choices and that's the case for jobs too until the time comes when God is like
18:35
like for me I had many different jobs until God was like I want you to be an
18:40
apostle and then even when I was an apostle and started the church he still wanted me to be working I was just
18:47
working at where I was at as a nanny um but until God brings that definite shift
18:55
like this is the job that you're going to fulfill your calling in and sometimes
19:01
it's sometimes you are fulfilling your purpose in your job
19:07
but that's not even the main part of your purpose like what you do serving in
19:13
the church for example is the main part of your purpose but God still uses you in your job it's different like when God
19:20
calls someone to be a minister a fful minister that's in that office is where
19:26
they're going to be really fulfilling their the purpose the the the most part
19:31
but then if some some but not everyone's called to be fful ministers but they have such an important calling
19:36
nonetheless and so some people God for some people they may be dentists they may be doctors they may be lawyers they
19:43
may be teachers um they may be musicians uh you know and God but God
19:51
may use you greatly in that place and reaching the lost but then he may the
19:58
bulk of what you're called to may be serving in the church and doing using your gifts for God in the church um but
20:07
before God makes it Crystal Clear of the long-term job for your life for example
20:14
and that that could change it could be seasonal season seasonally in your life jobs may change but for the most part
20:21
before God reveals this is going to be your your main career
20:27
um wants you to use use uh your your the the brain he's giving you that's made in
20:34
His image and make these choices and make wise choices like um look for a job
20:40
that will adequately pay the bills like be wise in that regard don't choose a
20:46
job that's not going to pay the bills you know use your mind that he's giving
20:52
you so make sure has that requir make sure has the requirement that um you're
20:57
not going to have have to compromise yourself like um that may be like
21:04
serving large amounts of alcohol to people or something you know something like that um so but but but but as long
21:12
as it's not doing that you're not having to compromise yourself uh choosing a job that's uh
21:19
that you that you would like that you would have passion for that you have giftings in and um many times that will
21:29
can help people can be a way to to to lead others to the Lord now there
21:35
could be Seasons where you have a work from home job where you don't interact with people and you're like I don't know
21:40
how I'm really doing much for the kingdom but God's having you do so much in the church serving in the church that
21:47
it's okay like this is used for God to provide for you um for for provision
21:56
wise you know what I mean so uh long story short uh if you are in a
22:03
job that's draining super draining and stressful and like God hasn't really
22:10
spoken like I want you here yeah look for another job you know
22:17
uh especially if that's taking a I mean the the the draining and the
22:22
stressfulness of the job is taken away from the areas God has called you to a
22:28
light for him and a vessel for him you know you're not even able to serve God you're not even able
22:33
to have like energy to be a light when you're out and about interacting with
22:38
people or you're not even having energy to like come on the lives and receive
22:45
the word of God and um you're not even having energy to like share what God's doing on your Social Media stuff like
22:52
that so with what I shared you follow the Holy Spirit wisdom of the Holy Spirit and make the right decision what
23:00
if you're continually find finding your workplace toxic with the way people speak think and do things what is the
23:07
best thing for me to do this kind of piggybacks onto the last
23:13
qu I answered so part one to the answer to your question is what I just spoke
23:20
you know if you're finding your job is uh more toxic than usual like maybe
23:28
you've had other jobs and you know if you're getting a job in a in the world they're not going to be perfect
23:34
and that's okay we're not all called to just work in Christian uh businesses or
23:39
something we're called to be the salt of the earth the light of the world we got
23:45
God needs a good majority of people to have jobs in the world not only jobs in
23:53
the church you know so but so but but there I mean it there are some
23:59
workplaces maybe you've noticed where maybe you've had a bunch of different jobs in the world and some
24:05
were more toxic than others maybe there there's a enemy has a
24:10
stronghold over one place or more than the other Maybe the owner of this
24:17
particular business or your boss has a lot of demons compared to another place
24:23
that maybe a person has one demon and I say that because it's very common for people to be oppressed by demons and
24:30
that's when toxic toxic work life you'll you'll
24:37
start to see happen you know um so I mean if you're if if if if you don't
24:43
feel that you need to be glued to this job if God hasn't made it clear I want you here at this job and it's really
24:50
extraordinary toxic more than usual like other jobs you've had maybe yeah get
24:56
another job look for another job as You Follow the Holy Spirit but um but I mean once again God
25:06
can use God can use that that as a stretching so whether
25:12
that's maybe you start to look for a job and you're really not finding another job for six
25:18
months but those six months God can really use to stretch you to refine you
25:24
anytime we go through something difficult God uses it anytime I mean
25:31
every difficult thing is an opportunity for us to grow spiritually for us to
25:36
grow in the character of Christ of how we're responding to these hard situations and to grow in our
25:43
faith so have patience with God you know if you're sensing like this is extra toxic I'm going to find another place
25:50
because God hasn't spoken I need you specifically at this place um and with the the made in the image of God using
25:57
wisdom you decide to look for another job and you're not finding another job yet you don't need to freak out you don't need to like think you need to
26:02
quit immediately it could be that God is using that that time period one month
26:08
two month 3 months six months whatever to stretch you through that
26:13
um harder time of dealing with more toxic
26:18
workplace explain calling someone into the Kingdom so we are given Authority in
26:25
Christ on this Earth God is given us Authority and he is he has he has told
26:31
us that our there is power in our words the power of life and death is in our
26:37
tongues and Jesus has demonstrated through him Ministry on this on this Earth in the gospels the
26:44
power of our words that he he he's he's demonstrated to us that this is how you walk in authority is by speaking whether
26:50
it was whe whether it was
26:55
Lazarus wake up get up whether it was um pick up your mat and walk whether it was
27:02
um demon go like whatever like Jesus is speaking different commands to people
27:08
and then we see miracles happen happening this was Jesus demonstrating this is how you walk in your Authority
27:15
and how you see the power of God move through you to accomplish God's will
27:22
this is how demons obey this is how the things of the darkness have to OB
27:28
obey respond obey and respond to your Authority is the
27:33
words Centurion Soldier said to Jesus just speak the word be healed to my
27:38
servant from a long distance and I believe he will be healed and Jesus says be healed or he says it is done
27:43
according to your faith he is healed he speaks the word and that's it that's the power That's The Power of your words
27:50
that's what that's how you walk in authority God when he created the whole universe he spoke he spoke let their
27:57
there be light he spoke so he used his authority to create and then Jesus said
28:03
to his disciples if you if you say to this mountain move and you believe that
28:11
what you said will happen then it will move so he didn't say if you believe
28:17
that if you pray to me to move the mountain I will then do it now it is
28:24
God's power moving the mountain I'm not saying God's excluded from our Authority no he's he's he's such he's the biggest
28:30
part of our Authority is his power but he's called us to walk in authority walk
28:36
in authority like Jesus did execute our Authority be the ones to speak instead of saying God you come down from heaven
28:43
in human form and speak no he's called us to speak to do what he did so we
28:49
speak and his power moves and backs us up partners with us so our part is to
28:56
speak to execute our Authority our part isn't the power part our part isn't The Miracle part our part is to walk in
29:03
authority speak God's part is the miracal part God's part is the power part that's why he gets all the glory
29:09
because we're not doing much compared to God what is us just speaking a word compared to all the power of God in the
29:16
world to do the miracle right we aren't moving the mountain it's God's power
29:22
moving the mountain but God chooses to use us God chooses to not move the
29:28
mountain until we speak so he said to the disciples if you
29:33
speak move to the mountain and you believe that what you said will happen
29:39
it will happen meaning you believe in the The Authority you have and you speak
29:44
it you don't be shy about it you boldly speak because you know the authority you
29:49
have you know that when you speak God's power is going to move and that Mountain's going to move you understand how it works in the spiritual real you
29:55
understand Authority so so you understand that it's you and God you speak God moves so if I speak I know the
30:02
mountain will move because I know God's power is backing me up so um this is something that many
30:11
Christians don't realize which is a big problem because this is such a big part of what we are called to do on this
30:17
Earth is walk in authority and this is where we see in our own lives healing and freedom take place and where we see
30:22
in other people uh uh healing and freedom take place as we declare healing
30:28
demon go and so um you know renouncing is so
30:36
powerful because you're using your Authority in Christ and you're kicking the devil out you're saying I renounce
30:42
these demonic thoughts in my mind and that's like you saying to the the per
30:47
the the um intruder at the door you open door and saying from now I know I
30:54
allowed you to come in my house before and sit down and talk and and even take things if you do whatever you want but
30:59
from now you're no longer allowed to come in I renounce you I renounce you
31:05
bringing you in allowing you to come in my house I renounce you and I will not let you come back in this house I'm
31:12
shutting the door now I renounce you that's the action of renouncing in the
31:17
spiritual realm like so you're renouncing um these these demonic thoughts it's it's powerful you're using
31:24
your Authority in Christ and the devil has to obey so that's why many times when you renounce where the anointing is
31:31
demons are forced to go there's nothing that they can hold on to you've done your part of using the authority in
31:38
Christ that God gave you you're not being like a a robot but you're saying I want my freedom I don't want the devil
31:44
anymore I don't want this oppression anymore and I'm using my authority in Christ and saying I don't want you
31:50
anymore and then the anointing is there to destroy the Yoke so calling someone into the kingdom is like the the
31:57
opposite of renouncing so there's so much power in speaking so speaking is just I mean calling someone into the
32:03
kingdom what that means is is praying for them using Authority in Christ they are my friend they are my family I
32:10
recognize there is spiritual warfare on their life the Devils after their life they are related to me they are my
32:16
friend they are my family I love them they are they are my family I call them
32:22
into the kingdom I I call them into the kingdom I use my authority in Christ
32:27
and I call them into the kingdom it's it's the it's like it it's like when you sense that there's a mountain
32:34
spiritually in someone's life you are speaking to that mountain now they still have free will so it's not like a magic
32:40
thing like you calling them into the kingdom guarantees like you have all the
32:46
power you and God out I mean God doesn't force people to come into the Kingdom so
32:53
we can't but we can uh uh use the authority that we have and speak to that mountain and then it's up to them how to
33:01
know the difference between your own heart's desire and a promise God has placed on your
33:09
heart I will say first of
33:14
all that the answer to this question may not be something that immediately comes
33:22
but may come over time as you apply the principles I'll share so number one one
33:27
principle that's important is to surrender everything to God to truly surrender everything to God
33:34
and take the time and intention to surrender each and every dream I mean
33:39
you have certain things that you desire so much and and good things too good
33:45
good Godly things you know maybe it's maybe it's marriage
33:50
children um career things I'm just thinking of like good Godly desires
33:55
right now I know there's more too but um to take those precious good beautiful
34:02
Godly desires that that you believe but maybe you're not sure but you believe
34:09
that God gave you those desires and even further on like promised you but still
34:18
there should be a time that you surrender it to God that you even though
34:24
you you believe you know you should still go to that extent of full surrender and
34:33
complete humility and say Lord I believe that
34:38
these are desires you gave me and I believe these are promises you gave me
34:44
but still I humble myself you know I humble myself to know
34:50
like you could reveal something different later on you could maybe you
34:56
haven't revealed yet that you want to take one of these and give me something else instead possibly like I just humble
35:05
myself I humble myself and just say Lord take all of them like I I put them
35:10
safely in your hands where I know that I can trust you there so I think of it
35:16
this way like I think of um like all my desires that I have that I believe all
35:21
the desires are not godly we reject we know I want out of there you know but
35:28
those beautiful pure good good desires but maybe you're not 100% sure um really
35:34
if it's God's perfect plan or if it's just your dream you've had since you were a child you know I take them all
35:42
and I place them instead of holding them in my hands holding them in my heart I
35:47
put them in God's hands and so I say God you do what you
35:53
want so if that means you're you're keeping them all and releasing to me
36:00
releasing them to me in your timing so be it but if there are one or two that
36:07
actually isn't your plan for my life but I know you have something even better
36:13
then you can take out I I give you Authority so to really surrender that to
36:19
God surrender all of them to God and really mean it um you should do that that's number
36:25
one um and then uh and then just rest
36:31
and be patient with God because he will many times the way that he stretches our
36:37
faith is in the place of mystery as I shared last week I shared a lot about
36:42
the mystery of God last Wednesday not this Wednesday but the Wednesday before you can watch it on my previous lives I
36:49
shared on the mysteries of God and giving Insight Revelation on why God is
36:54
mysterious sometimes why he he chooses to not reveal things clearly to
37:00
us at least in the timing we want um so listen to that if you haven't listened to that also this past Sunday I shared a
37:07
little more about the mysteries of God but sometimes that's part of the mysteries of God like sometimes when it
37:14
comes to desires of your heart um if you're not quite sure is this really
37:20
God's promises or is it just my desires sometimes God purposely doesn't
37:26
want to reveal that um till later that's part of the
37:31
trusting him that's that's a big part of it um so but what you just need you
37:38
don't need to really worry about anything just don't force anything you know uh just surrender to God Rest in
37:45
him and then he'll make things clear as time goes on if he really you know wants
37:51
a certain desire out of your heart cuz he doesn't want you to be so focused on it even though it's like a good a desire
37:57
or something then he'll make that clear but um if not just keep keep it in your
38:04
heart and um but but but put most of your focus on what God is calling you to
38:10
do right now you know put most of your focus there like for example for me
38:16
certain desires of my heart uh promises from God desires of my heart I I think of from time to time but I'm not
38:22
obsessing over I'm not um taking too much time from the now and
38:28
putting them there um what you need to make sure you're doing is just staying
38:33
present and using the energy and time for the present for what God wants you
38:39
to do in the present so you don't need to feel like you have to have it all
38:44
figured out many times God isn't going to reveal all those details till later
38:50
is there any difference on how slash when the anointing comes on you for example listening to a podcast
38:56
as I drive versus sitting down as if I was in class like for fful church for
39:02
example so Sundays you should treat as if you are in class uh being there in church or
39:10
watching live and if you cannot watch live because of a Time conflict of living in a different time zone or
39:16
something like that watch the replay and treat it as if it's the live and treat it as if it's class like with such
39:22
seriousness um and then Wednesday messages are also very important so those are like very crucial messages
39:29
prophetic words for that week that God needs you to really get in you and to take seriously and so Wednesdays well it
39:37
might not always be Wednesdays because sometimes Revival events during the middle week but the mid mid type week or
39:43
during the week live messages that I do um those also are um very important also
39:50
these subscriber q&as for those who want to take it seriously it's like you're taking you're taking being a discip Le
39:56
very seriously so if that's you then these also would be very important and there's answers to questions that God is
40:03
releasing prophetically by the week that he knows you need to hear um so like so
40:10
basically three should be treated very seriously like class and if you have time if your schedule allows to treat
40:18
more like we have weekly podcasts twice twice a week that go out um if you can
40:23
treat those like class and be very attent very attentive to them then
40:29
that's great but it's going to depend on the season and timing of your life that you're in if you have tons of free time
40:36
on your hands then God's going to be asking for more um if you don't have as much time on your hands in the season
40:42
that you're at then it's going to look like driving in the car and listening to messages and that's great and God can do
40:48
just as much and God can do just as much in terms of um the anointing coming upon
40:54
you and receiving as um as if you were sitting like class
41:01
and nothing else but just sitting there you know so it pretty much just depends on the season you're in um you know you
41:10
don't you don't need to like worry about it like you don't need to think like I'm not going to listen to this while I'm
41:15
driving because I need to listen to this seriously when I'm at home maybe you can listen it to it while you're driving and
41:20
then God can speak to you this one is so important you need to go home and treat
41:25
it like F like give full attention to it and listen to it a second time so just really follow the Holy Spirit the
41:31
anointing is moving through all of them and and touching you in in every way but
41:37
to to to to Really summarize it make sure you're at least taking the weekly
41:43
present prophetic ones um messages making those really priority important
41:50
can God place a desire that is not really beneficial for oneself example
41:55
him calling you to go to a place where you know your character will be tested yes absolutely that's an example of
42:01
following the voice of the Holy Spirit versus following your
42:07
heart you know like that's what I was talking about this past Sunday or a couple Sundays ago I mean um how the the
42:15
will of God isn't always fun um Jesus he said
42:21
Lord if you could take this cup like I don't want to go through this but not my
42:27
will yours be done so it's like it's like Jesus he was fully God and fully
42:33
man so the the human part like fully like knew the heart's
42:42
desires but really was not blind to the will of God knew the will of God like it's not like
42:50
it was this is this God or is this not no Jesus knew God's will you know and in
42:55
the same way like you what you're saying your heart's desires are like I don't want to go here but I feel this strong
43:02
pulling desire to do this but it's going to be uncomfortable but it's going to be
43:08
stretching but I can't deny this pulling desire like you're calling this a desire but it's really a pulling the
43:16
leading of the Holy Spirit yes that that's an example of God calling you to
43:22
something that is an uncomfortable space but he God is absolutely doing that
43:27
throughout our lives calling us to uncomfortable places and Seasons sometimes why should Believers
43:34
desire to prophesy and what is the appropriate time according to God's order
43:40
so this scripture really it depends on the calling it depends on the calling of
43:46
the person's life so in general we are all called to prophesy all believers God wants us to
43:53
all be prophetic and to prophesy but many people think that prophecy means
43:59
only big prophecies and some people may think prophecy means to speak very
44:06
specific words of knowledge maybe even someone's phone number and address
44:12
um other people may think it's always having to do with the future and like whoa how could you know that like like a
44:20
sign and a Wonder like for a prophecy to be a sign and a wonder it is those things but it's not always those things
44:28
and uh the big way that God wants all of his people to prophesy is through
44:35
edification is through building up the Believers to be building up other
44:40
believers and so um when you when you
44:46
are when you are receiving impartation of anointing you are planted at a church
44:51
where God's power is and the anointing is coming from the head down flowing to the rest of the body like we see in the
44:58
example in the Psalms of Aaron how it says the it's like the oil coming down
45:04
Aaron's head down his beard down the rest of his body down his robes it is like um the anointing of Paul coming to
45:11
down to Timothy and his spiritual children if you are positioned properly
45:17
uh like in planted in a church where God's power is at and the anointing is going to be flowing on you it's going to
45:22
be prophetic anointing like at fivefold Church it is an it's an Apostolic and prophetic
45:28
Ministry prophetic anointing is in the head and will be flowing to the rest of
45:33
the body prophetic anointing will automatically be flowing upon you as long as you are surrendered to
45:40
God you are keeping do shut to the enemy and you're being a true disciple then
45:47
the prophetic anointing will automatically be imparted to you not just any anointing but prophetic
45:54
anointing and but but but but the big way that God is calling everyone to to
45:59
to prophesy is in terms of edifying Believers now this doesn't always mean
46:07
speaking very vivid words of knowledge like addresses and phone numbers for
46:12
example this can be something very simple as looking at a person at a
46:19
Believer with love and feeling the love of God for them and making the int attention to
46:26
love on them and encourage them and as you're speaking to them prophetic
46:31
anointing starts to flow it could be something very simple seeming
46:37
like you are you you are shining so bright you
46:46
you I just you just shine God you know
46:52
you your you're it's just beautiful how God uses
46:59
you um you you're just a beautiful servant of God and um like you could be
47:07
moved in your heart to share that with somebody someday and to you it doesn't
47:12
feel so revelatory it doesn't feel super prophetic to you it can just feel like
47:18
it's your emotions like it's how you feel like you just feel like you've just been observing and noticing that they're like working hard for God and like
47:26
they're radiating God because they're they're serving with joy you can tell like they're serving God with joy and to
47:33
you you just feels like your feelings but actually it's the prophetic anointing and that person there could be
47:40
a the reason why you felt moved especially to say that to that person
47:46
that day is because the devil was really attacking
47:52
that person that person was bombarded out of no war with lies of the devil condemning lies feeling like they
47:58
weren't doing good enough feeling like they weren't doing much for God feeling like just not good
48:05
enough or maybe they're feeling unseen or something like this is just the lies of the devil just specifically attacking
48:11
them out of nowhere and then you just feel today I just feel led to encourage them you are prophesying to them in that
48:18
moment and sometimes you don't even know it sometimes you will never even know it you until the person says whoa you do
48:26
not know how I needed to hear that you know so that's the big way that
48:34
um that that God is calling most of his Believers to prophesy that the meaning
48:40
of desire to prophesy um and I say most people
48:46
because God has such order when it comes to prophecy when it comes to things of
48:52
the future and definitive words for for the body over and over an individual's
48:58
life like a definitive word of New Direction um or a definitive word of
49:05
someone's calling over their life God has order for
49:13
example I um was before I when I first encountered
49:20
the power of God I didn't understand order yet I didn't understand order until
49:26
until God taught me through my spiritual father Prophet Dr D Davy and so there was about a 9mon period of me
49:34
encountering God's power and starting to learn about the anointing the power of God Apostles Prophets The prophetic
49:41
there's a 9month period where I didn't have much
49:46
wisdom in terms of like the order of Prophecy and
49:53
um and but I just was new to the power of God and so so therefore I went to different circles I went to different
49:59
churches I went places where they embraced the prophetic and they were very uh very embracing of the prophetic
50:07
and they were I mean that was their big giftings and giftings there and and and
50:12
so therefore I received a lot of Prophecy a lot of Prophecy that I know
50:18
was looking back was just people speaking actually out of order um and
50:23
other things that weren't really true that could have been the angel of Light
50:30
speaking to someone could have been their own emotions um you know I just experienced
50:36
a lot of that and so I learned a lot like when I learned the order I I looked back and and it taught me of what was
50:44
going on and also errors in the body of Christ and lack of knowledge of order
50:51
when it comes to prophetic in many places um and so uh you know I had a lot
50:57
of I was just for those nine months I was going lots of places and receiving
51:03
lots of Prophecy or prophecy and um but would you know that not one person
51:11
prophesied to me that I was called to be an
51:16
apostle um and uh then my spiritual father prophesied this and um I know now
51:24
that God had order and God was literally not revealing to others what my calling was God had order
51:32
that God wanted it according to his order for this prophecy to come through my spiritual father he was my spiritual
51:39
father at the time but God wanted him to be my spiritual father shortly after um so so yeah so I mean I received like big
51:47
prophecies I've received prophecies that um I was going to be a singer and a household name and everything but but
51:53
with singing you know I received a bunch of a bunch of prophecies but um not Apostle and so so
52:00
that's just a little like look into seeing how God is serious about his
52:05
order and and and how we have to be careful to not be just prophesying
52:12
people's callings because not everyone's called to do that and we shouldn't be so
52:17
prideful to think that God has called us to be the mouthpiece of God for this
52:22
person to to to speak this huge dire for someone's life um yeah so so that's why I say most
52:32
are called uh explicitly like only to
52:39
prophesy in terms of this edification um and and with the flow of
52:44
the prophetic anointing not necessarily trying to prophesy I want to
52:50
prophesy about this person but no just being normal loving person and allowing
52:55
Holy Spirit to flow through you naturally um and also being humble like
53:01
like you know instead of being like God
53:07
told me that you are going to be this incredible servant of God that instead
53:15
you would share like what how what I shared previously you know um I say that just
53:23
because sometimes people can be over dramatic over dramatic in terms of what
53:28
God's actually speaking because maybe they have other motives or maybe they want to sound spiritually impressive or
53:35
sometimes it can be unfortunately like manipulating like God speaks to me let me prove to you and I'm wording it this
53:42
way so you can um believe that I'm really The Voice the mouthpiece of God
53:48
for you and you should keep coming to me and you know so that's why I say we got to be humble and make sure we're not
53:54
quick to be like God told me and reaching for these prophecies that God's
53:59
not calling you to speak or you know that's why I say we have to be humble
54:06
when we prophesy through
54:12
encouragement in your past teachings on intimacy with God you've said that God doesn't judge our relationship with him
54:17
is it okay for us to reflect and want to get better at talking with God through the day yes I mean you should have always
54:24
the desire to please God and to please him in your relationship with him
54:29
meaning that you're spending enough time with him that you are bringing him
54:35
into your life always you should have that humble and pure desire to please
54:43
him but what I've shared in the past about God not judging our relationship what I mean by that is so many
54:50
people um hear the voice of the devil and think it's God condemning them and
54:56
like that God is like with this checklist like did they
55:02
read enough chapters of the Bible today check you know did they pray the right
55:10
way to me end for a long enough time check did like you know a lot of people
55:17
they um think that God is being this judge of our relationship and when we
55:25
see it that way it causes us to perform and that's kind of gross and creepy to
55:31
perform in a relationship you wouldn't want your best friend to perform you
55:36
would want them to have real intimacy with you you know um so it's like that
55:43
when you see God that wrong way when you're constantly thinking how does God see our relationship does God see that
55:51
I'm doing enough in our relationship you are are being going on the side of
55:58
religiousness and and doing things through works and performance and that's one of the biggest problems of that
56:04
Believers have is is a relationship with God being religious and Performance
56:09
Based so um that's why it's important for you to to get that out of your mind
56:16
that God is with this here with this checklist and like did they do this
56:22
enough did they do this enough because that's not how we are with
56:27
relationships God looks at the heart so um you should want to desire to please
56:32
God in your relationship in terms of like that you're spending time with enough time with him and time in his
56:38
word and um also that you're speaking the words that you're speaking to him are pleasing to him you know you're not
56:44
complaining you're not spending your time in prayer complaining so you should have that heart to want to please him in
56:50
your relationship in that way but not go to the side of thinking he's this judge
56:58
over your relationship yes you know sometimes things we can overp
57:03
spiritualize um when just things can happen like taking a little fall or something
57:10
or getting in a little accident or something sometimes it's just like a part of life it's part of we don't live
57:16
on heaven and things happen and God uses it to refine us more but sometimes there
57:23
are things that are spiritual attack that we need to go in the spe over when you're seeing something reoccur um when
57:29
you're seeing something several times it can just be a specific attack of the
57:35
devil that you need to uh go in the spirit and take action and declare to
57:41
stop and if sometimes there can be an open door that happens in one's life and
57:46
that can be how an attack came um and when one is if you have
57:52
opened the door it's important you renounce it and it's it's wise to also sew a seed uh as every time you sew into
58:01
the anointing you reap more of that anointing and so sometimes there's an area where there
58:07
is a need for more of God's anointing in your life and making this sacrifice to God BR pulls upon the anointing and
58:14
releases the anointing in that area so that's if you ever find like in your life this is me just speaking this
58:22
this wisdom so you you all can know um rather than being like in the dark about it if it happens in the future if you
58:29
maybe open up a door maybe you didn't mean to open up a door but um you didn't realize that something was opening up a
58:35
door you know you you you didn't realize this was opening up a door maybe you this was a learning
58:41
experience um and and now there's this open door and
58:46
now you found these attacks and so this is the wisdom of what to do if that ever happens in your life to overcome and
58:54
have Victory and evict the enemy's attack that's come in your life I very
58:59
recently received the baptism of the Holy Spirit how do I grow in it so when to pray in the spirit to
59:07
Value it to remember that is it is such a precious gift to Value it to to not lose sight of
59:16
this precious gift that it is and to bring to remembrance the beauty that it is and the gift that it is and that it's
59:23
as we pray in the spirit working communicating directly to God um and to
59:28
to not uh lose that fire but to continually renew your mind and make it
59:35
a practice to pray in the spirit make it a practice uh because if it's easy to
59:42
forget things and to disvalue things if we don't make the intention to do
59:47
things such as as using our spiritual gifts that God's given us banri yes
59:55
uh you should only go to church where God has called you to be
1:00:00
planted if he has not called you to be planted somewhere then it it can be a
1:00:05
distraction it can be just something unnecessary uh like blockage in your
1:00:11
life if it's not where God called you to be and you can be planted virtually as well so um yes that's that's okay if I
1:00:19
tell someone I don't want something when they ask and they gift they get it for you anyway could this be manipulation it
1:00:25
could be yes it could be no it depends on the situation so if you have someone that you really trust that you love and
1:00:32
maybe they maybe they know that there's a gift a certain certain item that would really
1:00:38
bless you but maybe maybe it's kind of expensive maybe you wouldn't get it for yourself and they say they want to get
1:00:44
it for you but you're like no but you but they know it's because you don't
1:00:50
want them to like splurge on you and so then they get it anyway for you then
1:00:55
that's something that's okay to keep and it's actually beautiful it's it's it's a beautiful
1:01:01
blessing uh it can be a beautiful blessing from the Lord even that God is using uh this person to to to show love
1:01:09
to you through that person but it can be it also could it could be the other way
1:01:14
if it's if if if you sense manipulation through it then it is manipulation and you shouldn't you should just get rid of
1:01:21
it um yeah if it's if it's something you said no I don't want because and you're saying you don't want it you know
1:01:28
because God's leading you to saying you know this isn't this isn't going to be wise to accept a gift from
1:01:35
this gift from somebody maybe this person's shown manipulative behavior before um the holy spirit is just giving
1:01:41
you like red flags like how they may have a door open to the enemy just you know and they still give you something
1:01:49
then then that could be manipulation for sure so just don't uh you can throw it
1:01:56
away or um depending on the situation you could say you just don't even receive it just depending
1:02:04
um like for example if it is someone that is like an obvious wolf if it's
1:02:11
someone if it's like a man that is like trying to hunt a woman like um with
1:02:17
really really bad motives um then you know you you don't even have to feel
1:02:24
like you don't have to feel like you're going to hurtt their feelings or something if you don't accept it if if it's if it's a situation like that you
1:02:30
don't have to accept it other situations it's okay to like they hand it to you
1:02:35
but you renounce it and you throw it away just depending on H on the situation as Holy Spirit leads I'm going
1:02:43
