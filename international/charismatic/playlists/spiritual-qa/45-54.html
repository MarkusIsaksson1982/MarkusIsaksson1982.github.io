What does a mature believer look like
0:00
what does a mature believer look like and how to know if you are
0:06
mature so number one a mature believer is spiritual not carnal and simply put
0:15
to be spiritual means you have the mind of Christ you are spiritually
0:21
minded um you've been transformed into the to
0:26
be like Jesus in how he thinks because everything must come from how we think our
0:32
actions and our words will come from what we think what we meditate on what
0:38
we believe to be true so a mature believer has been
0:45
transformed um they have put in the spiritual work to renew their mind
0:51
consistently constantly day after day and so um they're they they don't fall
0:58
for the devil's lies they're able to perceive when a lie from the Devil comes
1:03
and not let that lie have power over them instead of reject it a mature
1:09
believer to be Spirit to be spiritual is to have the mind of Christ to be thinking
1:14
spiritually um and and what that means is is you know like to not worry how in
1:20
the word it says why would you worry that one who is mature literally does
1:25
not worry you can have concern in certain areas you know certain certain things are
1:32
serious situations but it's not worry you know that God will provide a
1:38
solution provide an answer provide wisdom provide an Open Door will provide
1:45
whatever is needed so there's no worry there can be concern but no worry uh a
1:51
spiritual mind just has a strong faith that God is good he is
1:57
faithful he will do what he has promised and there's nothing to fear nothing to worry about uh a spiritual mind um sees
2:06
people with the eyes of Jesus uh doesn't hate loves
2:12
all not about feelings but love spiritually and in action um to be spiritual
2:22
means um to take the word of God seriously the
2:28
written word of God in the spoken word of God so what is taught you don't have to be told again when God speaks
2:34
something when God speaks something through uh teacher through your teacher you take it to heart you apply it you
2:42
don't have to be taught again and again told again and again um but you receive
2:47
it you have the fear of God you put it into practice what God has spoken to you
2:53
to do um and a mature believer therefore can be trusted by God and can be trusted
2:59
Ed by Servants of God with more responsibilities with the work of God um a mature
3:08
believer is has a pure childlike heart
3:13
and is not skeptical critical whiny
3:20
Moody but is um pure in
3:27
heart so those are some characters istics of a mature believer a mature believer also um is
3:37
serious about the work of God and puts God and his work and his kingdom first and
3:43
um doesn't get distracted by other things in life but stays consistent and
3:50
steady with the work of God you mentioned on the Wednesday teaching about pulling anointing out can you
3:57
explain this better pulling anointing I think I was speaking about how
4:02
um like for uh when you are listening when you are receiving from an anointed
The anointing in a vessel
4:09
servant of God they are carrying anointing to release to you um but God
4:16
never forces himself and so in the same way the anointing in a vessel he doesn't
4:22
force on people so Jesus in his hometown could not do any Miracles hard hardly so
4:31
in the spiritual realm that's the action of like all this powerful I mean what that looks like is in in the spiritual
4:37
realm all this powerful anointing was in Jesus and could have just been poured
4:42
out so mightily on all these people in his hometown and all these Miracles could have taken place all this healing
4:49
and deliverance and so much power of God but instead it was kept inside it was
4:55
kept inside because God does not force himself Force the Miracles Force the
5:02
power of God to come out through a vessel uh so in the so we have a responsibility to
5:11
be hungry and pull out the anointing pull upon the anointing rather than be
5:19
full and not want it because it will stay so um I've literally seen this even
5:27
I I felt that the energizing of the holy spirit in me when people are hungry who
5:34
I'm ministering to I felt just this the the energy of
5:40
the Holy Spirit like like re like so
5:46
saying yes let's go upon this hunger um and then I've
5:52
seen the difference of I've ministered before where people aren't hungry and it and it feels like
6:00
it feels like there's a hold on the anointing you know like it's um it's
6:06
really just you know especially in the earlier days before the Revival broke out I don't see it that much these days
6:13
but sometimes there can be more less hungry spaces but especially in the earlier days it was something that um
6:22
was difficult a lot for me sometimes because like in the early days before the Revival broke out even like even
6:28
though like all these tremendous Miracles weren't taking place I knew the power of the anointing I knew the
6:33
anointing was really here and it was grieving when I could see people just like weren't hungry and and I and I
6:40
wanted to be like come on like get hungry but I I it's like the the
6:47
minister the servant of God is having to tr use so much strength
6:54
sometimes you know come on get hungry and even then the people can still not
6:59
be hungry so um but then on the other hand the anointing is so mighty and so
7:07
powerful and we as vessels it's not supposed to look like a lot of physical effort but the people need to be hungry
7:12
so when the people are hungry it's just it's flowing it's with ease it's like
7:18
the the times where I've seen the people the most Hungry Like The Times where I've ministered in places where the people are the most hungry is like the
7:25
easiest like job for me like when I Minister it feels so easy I I I finished
7:32
the event full of so much energy um
7:37
because just the the anointing is so powerful that you don't have to do much
7:43
you're just a vessel that just allows God to move through and so so
7:48
much is happening so many mighty works are happening Mighty works of God are
7:54
happening when people will pull will be hungry and just let God pour out versus
8:02
not that hungry the servant of God is like I'm hungering so much for your eyes
8:08
to open up so I am going to really encourage you to be hungry and
8:16
come on guys come on like it's it t it's more like draining you know and and
8:23
unnecessary and sometimes still doesn't
8:28
um lead to anything lead to the people being hungry so most especially in CU we
8:34
are in Revival praise God and God is waking up as people and people are hungry most times like for me when I
8:39
Minister even if it's like 3 hours I literally don't feel drained I literally don't feel tired um I don't feel
8:50
like I don't feel that way most times praise God but it's because the
8:56
anointing is so powerful and because the hunger is there my yoke is easy my burden is light Jesus says that's the
9:04
meaning one of the meanings I'll answer your question briefly but I've taught this in depth I
Why do we only do communion once
9:12
teach this message on Easter um this question why do we at 5f why do we only
9:18
do a communion once while other teachers do other churches do many times a day even so this is a new wine so there's
9:25
going to be new revelation not new and in terms of like brand new but new
9:32
meaning new for the church today new meaning there's so much old wine skin in
9:38
the church today so much and and what that means is we need new wine which is
9:43
one of the ways new wine comes as New Revelations of really what God is speaking in his word in terms of what
9:49
he's commanding us to do in terms of how he's instructing us to do certain things
9:54
like communion and do certain things in church that's what we can be expectant
10:00
for so when we see things that are different we should automatically know this is new wine this is new wine you
10:07
know um a lot of things it's not so much of even that we really need like the
10:12
full understanding we will receive the understanding but just know that there are differences because it is so much
10:19
old wine skin old wine versus new wine when it comes to communion there's a
10:26
verse I don't have the verses right now in front of me but there's a verse that says uh when you do this do this in
10:33
remembrance of me and the prophetic Revelation that God has given me that
10:40
God has given us uh concerning when you do this do this in remembrance is this
10:47
is that God wants us to be doing this in remembrance
10:54
meaning with a time of really remembering and Valu
10:59
valuing what Jesus has done and to not take it lightly so anything that we do
11:07
too often we naturally are unable to really uh value it as much and it
11:16
becomes it can become a tradition I mean there are certain things that we are called to do every
11:22
day there's certain things like reading the word that isn't tradition but it's food we're eating it's it's the Daily
11:27
Bread we need but then are certain things that are not supposed to be
11:33
like done every day but it's supposed to be done specifically in
11:39
remembrance and this Revelation is the revelation of this is that it's similar to Christmas
11:47
um we could celebrate the birth of Jesus every single day we could or every
11:54
single week we could celebrate Christmas we could also celebrate uh the resurrection ction of Jesus every single
12:02
day um now of course we celebrate his life every day but you know what I mean
12:07
there's this we in we as Christians we as a body of Christ we all celebrate
12:13
each of those one time a year and that's something that one of the few things that most agree on it's most um in the
12:21
body of Christ we celebrate the birth of Jesus once a year we celebrate the
12:27
resurrection of Jesus once a year and as we do these things we are doing it in remembrance we are it's like we are
12:33
memorializing we are um taking this one day and really really specifically
12:41
remembering and celebrating his birth his resurrection and as we do it once a year
12:48
it makes it so special it makes it hold so much value and it doesn't become this
12:54
like religious thing because it's not too often um and so that is revelation that God
13:02
has given for concerning communion that communion should be done in the same way
13:08
of in in that's the meaning of in remembrance and there is great power in
13:14
taking communion uh an miraculous power in taking communion when it is
13:22
done not too many times but really with value and in remembrance
13:29
I remember my uh my spiritual father Prophet Dr J Davy sharing this Revelation with me and sharing how um in
13:38
his church when they do communion they do communion at Easter or uh
13:44
Resurrection Day uh every year and so
13:49
many miracles take place as they're taking communion but it's it's because it is
13:55
done the right way with this revelation and really holding value rather than
14:01
just going through the motions of like take eat repeat like the the just
14:07
going through the motions we're doing community again we're doing a community again we don't know why we're just doing it again and again we're just doing it
14:13
out of ritual then there holds no power there holds no power that God intended
14:19
to have in it but it's just done again and again as a ritual um so that is the
14:26
new wine Revelation a lot of people won't won't receive that a lot of people because they're used to doing it a
14:32
certain way to them it's just naturally right just because it's done it's always
14:37
it's tradition but um so a lot of people may not receive that but but this is the
14:44
true revelation of what Jesus meant when he said do this in
14:53
remembrance um five of church we are we are religion free zone we
14:59
we will we do not allow
15:04
um Traditions religious Traditions to
15:09
come and bring strongholds and keep the Holy Spirit from moving freely and God moving in
15:15
power so we are the new wine
15:23
Hallelujah okay yeah I yeah actually going back to the question about communion I think that the exact message
15:30
I was talking about was just released this week on my podcast actually ironically or
15:36
not so God is already answering this question this week on the podcast about
15:41
communion that message that I was referring to from back in April was just released of my podcast this week I knew
15:48
it was soon when you asked that but I didn't know I couldn't remember if it was this week so that's awesome you can
15:54
listen to it on the podcast how do we make sure we don't become too
16:01
familiar with our spiritual mother take you for granted uh well the biggest way is to
How do you renew your mind
16:06
renew your mind to renew your mind um you know to the truth of that this is
16:12
your place to receive from that this is to renew your mind of what God has done
16:18
in your life already through the ministry of your spiritual father
16:23
spiritual mother um how you have changed and received so much through the
16:29
ministry through the vessel uh and as you renew your mind in that way it it
16:34
helps you to see there's a there's a Godly good separation you know like my spiritual
16:41
mother or my spiritual father is separated for my good separated set
16:47
apart set apart for my good set apart to be a vessel of God for my life to
16:54
release the equipping to release the anointing and with that come with that
16:59
also means there will be Revelation that God brings them that I might not have
17:05
yet that I won't have yet because they are called to release it to me this is it's the way like
17:11
God excuse me I need more hands here but God coming God coming here to release to
17:17
you here it's like the order and so um I've
17:24
been talking I was speaking this past um one Wednesday and also Sunday about that
17:31
order that order um how the oil comes from the head down to the rest of the
17:37
body down to the feet and so God doesn't skip over here and bring to the feet to
17:44
then speak to the Head uh and so Renewing Your Mind to this order and how
17:51
that they are set apart helps you to um not forget
17:59
not forget this order and helps you to not be too familiar when people become
18:04
too familiar they start they they stop seeing the set apartness and start seeing on like the
18:11
same level as we as like your spiritual mother and a spiritual father is a human just like
18:16
you and they could be the same age as you or they could be younger than you all these things when you start looking
18:24
with that eye looking at them towards in those lens in that kind of lens um
18:31
that's when you you you you start becoming too familiar and seen on the
18:37
same angle so um that's your answer to renew your mind to like how you really
18:45
know there is there is a set apartness that's a word happening um for
18:54
your good and with all that you've seen take place in your life and just the
19:01
testimonies and everything helps you to remember the spiritual reality the
19:06
spiritual reality of what's going on so that you don't see with a carnal mind
19:11
seeing too familiar and Renewing Your Mind take to
19:17
not take them for granted also Renewing Your Mind that like there was so much that you've
19:23
received in the past and so much transformation and so much word of God and that's not going to stop
19:30
like it's going to continue that's going to continue God's going to keep doing that God's going to keep releasing a
19:37
freshw Miracles that if you need them when you need them Abundant Life through
19:44
that spiritual mother spiritual father to you so it it keeps you full of
19:51
expectancy um in humility and in honor that's another thing that you should do
19:56
is to practice honor honor to make sure you keep
20:02
honoring Pastor Heather asked how much one-on-one time should a pastor devote to members in their church so it's going
How much time should a pastor devote to members in their church
20:08
to look different in different seasons it's really going to look different in each season depending on what God is
20:15
calling you to depending on your capacity okay so for me in a in the
20:23
season where our church was much smaller and in the season where our church had five people 10 people 15 people people
20:29
um they were all the people that I was reaching really even online there wasn't really a following yet they were all the
20:36
people that I was reaching I mean yeah that God was calling me to to reach so I
20:41
did spend um much more time oneon-one back then with those people because I
20:49
had the capacity and God was calling me to that in that season God was calling me to do more counseling at times in
20:58
that season and really all that I was doing each week was um I mean in the beginning
21:05
days I wasn't even going live actually I think that happened um started happening in around 2020 actually so the first
21:12
couple years I wasn't going live the first year I was working a part-time job um but I was editing and um preparing
21:19
the message on Sunday and ministering on Sunday but that was really um all I was
21:27
do in terms of like responsibilities and so it looked different for me in that season it
21:32
really was just how the Holy Spirit was leading and um not just that
21:39
but like God was calling me to really spend time and counsel certain people
21:45
that um were like had doors open up like they
21:50
were Christians but they were not completely surrendered and were not mature and so this was really really
22:00
um difficult for me at times because I would be mistreated sometimes by this person or they wouldn't they wouldn't um
22:06
value the time I was spending with them the and even the words I was speaking like they weren't taking to Heart
22:14
completely so um and sometimes this person would be like I'm I'm speaking about one
22:21
person specifically sometimes well actually a couple people they would be mean to me for no reason but it was just
22:26
like they needed freedom and they need did surrender so they had you know at that time the people needed more freedom
22:33
at that time there wasn't casting of demons going out going on you know so they did need freedom but they also
22:38
needed surrender it wasn't just that um they needed demons cast out of them but they needed to completely surrender to
22:44
God to be completely free as well so um in that season but I remember uh I
22:50
remember my spiritual father sharing this with me him saying like God is um
22:55
testing you through this uh because because you are called to be a
23:02
mother in the spiritual realm to multitudes and so if you can mother
God is testing you through this
23:09
these two people well and this at this time we had only like five to 10 people in the church and there were
23:14
specifically two that like I'm referring to um if you can mother them well and
23:20
love them well then he can trust you with like multitudes you know so like in
23:26
a different season in life those people there's no way I could spend that time with them and actually
23:32
God would be leading me like you have to put boundaries up because they're not valuing your word you know like it's
23:38
ending up draining you from all this huge work I've called you to do and
23:44
reach all these people you know like as Jesus says to the disciples if they
23:49
don't receive you um wipe off your feet and leave like it's not rude to like put
23:56
a huge boundary and while up sometimes right but in the situation it's not that they were completely not receiving me um
24:03
but back then it was like God was leading me to really invest in them so much that he
24:11
would definitely not be calling me to invest in them in this season because I because what he has called me to it's
24:18
like I would be I would be drained because he's called me to I have so much more on my plate like workload and now
24:27
he is calling me to reach Mass masses now he's calling me more of the like
24:32
dust your feet off when they don't receive you I've called you to reach so
24:38
many people and if you spend all this time here you're giving you're giving these
24:45
two people all your energy then the multitudes um are you won't have
24:51
anything to give to them right but back then there wasn't the multitudes and back then God was is
24:58
wanting me to not put the rigid boundary wall up in that season but it was a lot
25:04
for me from for me a shaping of my heart to um really give myself to put myself
25:12
last to love when it's not easy to just
25:18
give give give poor poor poor okay so um so yeah like that season versus this
25:25
season for me so so so different I mean
25:30
sometimes for me it was a roommate you know and so there was so many hours per day I was spending with someone that um
God will lead you from there
25:40
was was draining you know but in that season that's where God had me so
25:46
um but but when once there are you holy
25:52
spirit will lead you like with what your capacity is um and he will lead you from
25:58
there there will be certain people you were called to spend more time with pour in more because the person is really for
26:06
example receiving it and they um the the the the the pour the pouring in here is
26:13
going to lead to um the work of God to advance more or there could be someone
26:19
in a certain season that is really in need uh it's really in need really needs
26:26
extra attention love ha and so in that season God is calling you to give more
26:31
attention there to that person but just for that season because of where they are right there um and the thing that
26:41
you have to know to as you if you're a leader if you're a pastor As you move through these seasons is like for me
26:49
I'm naturally I used to be like naturally I used to be such an e
26:56
extrovert and and I just like Love Languages like one of them for me well
27:02
like Words of Affirmation and then was quality time like I just love to be with
27:08
people and listen to people and just show love with one-on-one quality
27:15
time and so um I have like I don't know
27:20
how many spiritual children spiritual children I have so many and I would love to spend oneon-one time with
27:28
all of you I would like my heart would love to do that but I have to like I have to really
27:35
be obedient to God and walk spiritually because in the spiritual realm with what
27:42
I am called to now um I'm not called to be spending personal one-on-one
27:48
spiritual time because there's just not the capacity but it doesn't mean that
27:53
the my spiritual children are missing out they're not missing out on like love
27:59
received even love received from me like for Me Maybe it feels like naturally it feels like but it but I'm not able to
28:07
show love as much when I can't do that but I have to renew my mind spiritually to see no be spiritual this is the this
28:15
is the reality in the spiritual realm um as you are teaching here like right now
28:21
like in the spiritual realm it's it it's it's like it's almost like I'm meeting
28:26
with you one onone it in the spiritual realm in terms of what you need from me
28:33
and this spiritual Divine like relationship of spiritual mother to son
28:38
or daughter um I'm called to feed you I'm called to show love to you through
28:45
giving you this time and attention and food and for what you need in the spiritual
28:51
realm from God in this area you are nourished you know it's not like you are
28:56
withheld anything or neglected in this area this is just how it works spiritually in the spiritual
29:03
realm so like in order to protect the anointing I have to be obedient to God
Protecting the anointing
29:11
with how I you how I spend my time and the boundaries that I put up it's really
29:19
so much having to do with protecting the anointing um because the anointing can
29:24
be drained it can be drained out for examp example one of the things that drains anointing is stress that's one of
29:31
the things that can drain the anointing but then the other thing that can drain that can drain it is um too much
29:39
like one-on-one counseling time spending with people because for me I'm called to
29:48
be in this place of pouring out um you know not like friend hanging
29:56
out type thing and so for me to spend
30:02
one-on-one time for example is is going to be a constant pouring out um because
30:07
that's just my position that's my call so that's why it's like very very
30:13
few are like ever hanging out with me it's because of my calling and it's part
30:21
of the price of carrying the anointing and it's it's part of the obedience to God to making sure that the anointing is
30:28
never been drained but that all of the big things that God's calling me to do
30:33
the big capacity that it's able to be reached like there's not like with God
30:39
calling me to do all of this that there's enough anointing and strength and energy and everything that's able to
30:46
fulfill everything that God's calling me to reach so for leaders for pastors you
30:52
have to be spiritual you have to renew your mind when Seasons shift when you used to have three five people only and
31:00
God W you had time and capacity and God was calling you to spend hours all the
31:05
time with each person counseling but also just kind of being her friend but then God will call you to shift to be I
31:12
mean I used to even spend more like like have dinner
31:18
after church and stuff with the people when there was just like five or 10 of us you know but then there becomes
31:23
really a shift where God wants you to take on more of a really really truly
31:29
like Shepherd role or spiritual mother or spiritual father role and that re
31:34
requires the the being set apart you know um and not so
31:41
casual in addition to a spiritual mother father could one have another Mentor for a different area of Life say business
Spiritual mother father role
31:50
career yeah so what happens is like you are being equipped spiritually for all
31:56
areas of life so for example in the realm of business now you take what you have been equipped with in the spiritual
32:02
realm and you apply that you apply that in terms of how you act morally with
32:07
business decisions number one number two you apply what you have re been equipped
32:12
by to the business when it comes to um having Dominion having Dominion like we are
32:19
called to have dominion on this Earth so in every sphere of influence let us have
32:25
dominion for God to have the glor glory for God's kingdom to come so you can have the wrong spiritual food and have
32:32
this religious mindset a poverty mindset and um you know
32:42
maybe maybe like put yourself in a box where you're like thinking religiously
32:49
like I can only interact in the business realm with Christians or something you
32:54
know you can have the wrong food and apply that but then you you can have the write food how I've taught before I
33:00
specifically thinking of the message on Palm Sunday I think it was the day before Easter actually um or the Sunday
33:07
before Easter um what's it called I forget the name of the message
33:13
but I I remember I I was wearing I was wearing a purple suit I just remember I can just remember that message so if you
33:20
want to find it it was the week before Easter but I was speaking about how we are called to have dominion and how we
33:25
are called to have abundance in every area so um some people are called to
33:30
have businesses and have a lot of money in the businesses but it to be used for God's glory to be used for God's
33:37
purposes um some people are called to that some people are called to have huge businesses and have them Thrive and then
33:45
this is part of God giving you more seed for his kingdom for example to invest
33:51
where he wants you to invest um to take Dominion in other areas through the seed
33:56
of life uh in the world to um give graciously to
34:02
God's work to the church with the seed maybe through that seed so many um doors
34:08
God will be able to open because of that seed that you have given to the church for example um this he can he can want
34:15
you to have this these big seeds like a lot of money in the business to give to orphans to give to those a need to give
34:21
to certain charities for example so anyways you receive spiritual food and
34:28
that helps you walk in wisdom you're made in the image of God and you're called to be making a lot of your own
34:35
choices and a lot of these are not going to be like God's telling me to do this God's telling me to do this but God's
34:40
giving you wisdom for you to make a decision for example um for me to choose
34:47
this shirt today I didn't have to ask God what color do you want me to wear today actually I was thinking you know
34:53
what I I have a different color nail today I think I'm going to wear shirt that matches that like that that was me
Spiritual business
34:59
making my own decision made in the image of God and so when it comes to like business and everything you are equipped
35:07
to have wisdom and to walk in wisdom to make your own decisions that God will be God
35:14
will approve of um so this person asked
35:19
is it okay to have business mentors and yeah I mean when it comes to business
35:25
you business advice um yes like you can have advice
35:32
there but what's important is that you need to know you need to know that this is for business it's not don't let it
35:39
creep into the like your spiritual life maybe this person is a
35:44
Christian don't let them just because you placed them as a mentor in the business realm don't let that
35:51
Authority them abuse their Authority don't let them start to have power over over you in other areas and mess with
35:58
your mind Children of the king is a message from F Sunday Children of the king I
Spiritual expectations
36:04
want to add something also on to um the answer that I gave that was
36:11
actually for pastors for leaders um but it's good also for you to know how it
36:16
works you know what I mean so if you so if you have expectations that are different you can understand your expectations aren't spiritual right so
36:23
if you have if you if you always were in a church or something where there was only 10 people and your pastor was able
36:29
to give you tons of personal time you can think that's just what a pastor is supposed to be and maybe you go to a
36:35
bigger church and maybe you start to have get bitter and have resentment towards your minister towards your
36:40
leader or start even thinking bad of them wrongly just because of this wrong expectation so this answer I gave was
36:46
good for you for you all to know but I also just want to add some another thing that is is for um not is not really for
36:56
leaders but for um for you all for those
37:01
uh for for those underneath spiritual mothers and spiritual fathers is to take
37:09
to to to have in your heart that you don't want to drain you know because sometimes one can be draining um and the
37:18
the thing is is that we we we are as Leaders we we are called
37:25
to put boundaries up but but sometimes we have to respond out of
37:33
love to God's people and it does drain so it's not like we're like H like divas
37:40
is like H this is draining I can't answer this email this is draining I can't I can't spend time to think about
37:47
this here this is draining I can't answer this question or you know we we
37:53
can't be like like divas you know like this is draining so no like sometimes
38:00
for our spiritual children we have we're called to just to just show love and there's still going to be boundaries
38:07
that need to be put up but um but one can still be draining you
38:13
know and so it's important for you to have that in your heart that you don't want to be draining and that you don't
38:19
want to um be stepping out of line you know um
38:28
like you should H have this understanding if your leader you know
38:33
is has a big capacity you know you should have that understanding and make
38:38
sure that there doesn't come any selfishness in the way sometimes um but there is this awareness of an an honor
38:46
of your leader of um their time and their capacity and
38:52
everything because that will end up slowing you down see that's the thing is like if if you are a spiritual child who
38:59
is draining who is acting like childish like not growing up spiritually not only
39:05
is that like bringing harm and draining to your leader but also it's just
39:11
bringing harm to you because it's it's making you remain as a baby like the more that you act more
39:18
childish and not growing spiritually the more that you stay in the same place and
39:24
you're not growing and you're not able to receive more anointing and you're not whenever you're staying like stuck in
39:30
the same place spiritually and you're not progressing um it's literally like
39:35
delaying you it's it's keeping you stuck from going glory to glory it's keeping you stuck from um accessing full
39:42
Abundant Life it's keeping you stuck from walking in your purpose fully it's keeping you stuck from receiving
39:48
anointing so all of these things are connected and this is I mean all of the
39:53
things like Breakthrough Financial break through and doors to open up um more
39:59
anointing to come in your life you to be really fully walking in your purpose all of that's connected to your
40:05
surrender which includes obedience which includes like valuing
40:13
the word released taking it to heart applying it and allowing God to
40:18
transform you and being strong in the Lord and growing up you know like being strong
40:25
when you don't feel like it so that you can grow right um so you know like when
40:34
a there's that trans transition when when kindergarten happens where the the
40:40
child goes from like a baby to like on their own I mean like they're with their parents all the time and then all of a
40:47
sudden they're gone from their parents for eight hours and they're living kind of more of an independent life you know
40:53
what I mean like there's that transition where like they have have to choose to grow up or they can choose to just
41:00
cry the whole day and cry mommy daddy mommy daddy you know what I mean and so it's like that in the spiritual realm
41:06
like we have to make the decision to stand on our own two feet and be strong so we can go so we can progress so we
41:13
can move forward so so yeah like all these things that you're looking for in life many
41:21
times are just connected to the simple thing right here of um being obedient
41:26
and allowing God to transform you and and growing and choose choosing to
41:32
grow so we can be praying for all these things God where is the provision where's the open doors why do I feel
41:39
like I'm stuck it can be simply what you're doing what you're not doing you know like you choosing to not grow in
41:48
the spiritual realm I'm see I'm doing what God has asked me to do but I'm seeing my
41:53
business dry up so a couple things number one if you really
Starting a church
42:00
believe like you're surrendered completely to God and you believe in your heart God is leading you in
42:08
this Lane in this business then don't
42:13
give up because sometimes God can make things really dry for a purpose God can
42:20
be using this as your your Wilderness your refining fire moment
42:28
for me God called me I knew he called me to be an apostle to start the
42:35
church and um it dried up you could say for four for four years every year I
42:43
mean it was never financially well off to begin with we
42:51
started with 20 people I found a place very well the first place we had church
42:57
was free with a donation that was a miracle to cuz it was the veteran it was
43:02
uh the American Legion so they allowed us to be there for free but we just were required to give a
43:09
donation praise God for that for that breakthrough um but even giving the
43:14
donation we I don't think we were even getting pretty much that amount in because we had like 20 people and then
Moving to Pan Pacific Park
43:21
after about a year of that or less less than a year just months we then moved to Pan Pacific Park where
43:28
we were in the senior activity center and then we had to pay every month and still that was very cheap compared to
43:33
most places to rent in La that was God's grace but still it was way more than
43:40
what was coming in for offering every week we had now about 15 people when we
43:46
moved there and then it moved to 10 and then it moved to five and then it moved to two until we stopped paying rent
43:53
there in Co times when it was 2 and we were actually there twice a week we would have worship nights on Fridays and
44:00
services on Sunday and um I was working a parttime job for the first year and then was just
44:06
full-time but there wasn't the finances actually my parents I didn't know what to do because I knew that God was for
44:14
sure I knew God was calling me to I also I had the prophetic word from my spiritual father I knew without a shadow
44:20
of of a doubt God was calling us to have church every Sunday um I knew without
44:26
shadow of a doubt so so I was in this place of like I know that this is God's
44:31
will so therefore I have to find where God is releasing the
44:37
provision because it's out there so I have to go to work in this area I can't just sit here and mope and cry but I
44:44
have to get things done in this spir I have to get things done I can't just um show up do nothing but just pray and
44:53
show up to Sunday and they said the doors are locked and they say well you
44:58
didn't pay and I was like I don't know well maybe money will
45:03
appear from the sky now you know what I mean no I had to make sure that we would pay and just use as as God said to Moses
45:12
what's in your hand use what I've given you so I had you have to actually get to work and find where the provision is
45:18
that God is releasing and get and find it somewhere you know it's there it's out there um and so I end up just asking
45:26
my parents and for my situation I was I just asked my parents I was on the phone
45:32
crying with my mom like never before in my life because because I mean rightfully so I
My Parents
45:39
mean I had been rightfully so my parents didn't quite understand fully because I
45:45
was a first pursuing acting and then doing music um for already um how many
45:52
years at this point uh three about three years about three 3 years and yeah three years three full
45:58
years I was in LA and they were still helping me financially they were helping me financially every year not fully I
46:04
was working part-time jobs but they were financially helping me for three years
46:10
because they they believed in me and they knew that to you you can't have a
46:15
full-time job and pursue acting and singing that won't work or you have no time to pursue that so they were so
46:21
generous and they helped me so then three years of that of them helping me after they they paid for my college
46:27
completely my parents are amazingly generous um after that then and by the
46:32
way when I went to college for was communication so then I wasn't even using my degree so they're just amazing
46:38
they're so generous and then um then I'm I'm saying now God's now they believe
46:44
the prophetic word completely but they didn't expect the church to not be able to take care of itself like at all you
46:51
know and so the first year um I'm just asking mom and dad I don't know what to
46:57
do Momom and Dad I don't know what to do like we have to pay rent and I know God's calling so could you please help cuz I don't know what else to do and so
47:04
they helped and then but then this went on for years and I would be crying um on
47:09
the phone because like I just don't know what to do with with Mom you know and
47:15
and they though it was difficult and though they didn't understand completely and it was a really big stretch for them
47:20
because they're retired teachers they're both retired my dad my dad does a part-time job J for for his own like
47:27
enjoyment too like he paints houses exterior as well in the Summers um but he's been retired since he was 55 and
47:34
he's 70 70 something now 70 76 now so he's
Stretching of Faith
47:40
been retired for a long time my mom's been retired for years as well so they're just retired so they were just
47:46
giving so much and um so long story sh I just wanted to give you a little insight
47:51
of like it was not working out financially but it didn't mean it didn't mean that
47:58
was a closed door from God at all it was actually the opposite and looking back I
48:03
can see that God did that on purpose because it stretched me like when I tell you I was crying on the phone with my
48:10
mom that it was tears of like pain like um like a stretching like
48:17
stretching of Faith pain like this is
48:22
difficult um those were the tears that I'm talking about uh not like emotional joyful tears no
48:29
those were like painful like and I've never gone through that before I've never been at that place financially so
48:36
stretched and um I was living so frugally I
48:42
mean if I I mean only cooking like hardly going out to eat if I did go out to eat making sure I'm not ordering more
48:49
than the meal and water like never getting like a dessert or a drink like that was my life for
48:56
um for a few years in of the Church of having the church you know so um so
49:03
being in that place doesn't mean you know God's not coming through always it doesn't mean there's a door shutting
49:10
here um it can sometimes mean God's doing this on purpose to stretch
49:16
you and um sometimes he can be doing it even to get you get you to a place of
49:21
seeking him more sometimes he can step back on business too like a prosperous
49:28
bus business maybe he can sometimes make it not be so prosperous for a time to to
49:35
empty out your schedule a little bit for a season to focus on him more and to re to focus on receiving and equipping
49:42
sometimes that can be a reason why he's doing that but it would will only be for
49:48
a season so you know as I preach we are called to Abundant Life we are called to walk in abundance walk in abundance in
49:54
every area and finances even but that doesn't mean like for every person like
50:01
if you're if you're being stretched that that stretching supposed to stop right there like what it means is like God
50:08
will provide and and you will not be without and that's what happened for me
50:14
through all of those years um four years of living of how I'm just
50:22
describing God came through every time I didn't go hungry ever I um had a roof
50:30
over my head and we still had Church you know and um having little
50:37
financially in that time didn't keep me from abundant joy and abundant peace and
50:43
um a thriving relationship with Jesus so um that's just for some of you
50:50
to know if that's what you're going through right now this can be an area God has purposely withholding purposely
50:56
to stretch you um and
51:03
um I also love how God did that because it kept me it trained me to really
Value
51:09
value to Value what he releases and to not be like to not be wasteful to not
51:15
take things for granted so God wants us to live not in a poverty mindset and in abundance but not wasteful and to and
51:24
and when money does come in that we are grateful for it that we value it and
51:29
that we are good stewards of it because we know what it's like to not have it
51:35
and we have grateful good Steward Hearts amen um there could be other situations
51:42
it just it depends with people I mean sometimes if if a business is drying up or something maybe sometimes that could
51:49
be God Closing a door and saying I want you to go somewhere else that could be the case sometimes Maybe but this is
51:55
going to be the Holy Spirit leading like if if holy spirit is really spoken to you I want you in this area now to focus
52:02
here on this business and there hasn't been another um like change of Direction
52:09
you've heard from him then keep going there and if you're in a place where you're uncertain just keep staying the
52:15
course where you're at and God will make things clear he will open and shut doors
52:21
that need to be open that need to be shut he will do it he will direct your path you don't need to be confused or anything um but if you're in this place
52:28
of like you were feeling from God that that that that there needs to be a
52:33
change of Direction in your life and then all of a sudden there's things drying up sometimes that can be a closed
52:38
door so it's good for you to know all of this that I'm sharing now so you don't you know jump to conclusions too quickly
52:46
or um but but but that you are walking in wisdom and you're walking you know
52:51
like in patience and not too quickly jumping like to conclusions but you just
52:57
remain patient and know that God is directing the steps of the righteous man or woman he will direct your steps and
53:02
he will provide advice for us who are Planet
53:08
whose spouse is not on the same page I shared um I think he was either last Sunday or not last Sunday um last
53:14
subscriber live or subscriber live before uh that you should first of all call your family members into the
53:22
kingdom of God so a seed for them specifically for them God I sow
Calling
53:28
this seed believing that their eyes will open up and that they will not be
53:36
blinded anymore and that they will be able to see what I've seen and that they will come fully into your kingdom maybe
53:42
they're Christians but they're not fully into your kingdom like believing all of your truths and receiving your move this
53:50
new move you know you to seeed on their behalf and you you declare you do the
53:56
opposite of renouncing but which is calling them in speaking because there's
54:01
so much power in your words calling them into the kingdom I call my spouse family
54:07
member into the kingdom of God I call them out of the kingdom of darkness in
54:13
any area if that is the case and may their eyes open up I call them you are
54:20
connected to them in the spiritual realm so powerfully so you have so much power
54:26
um Power spiritually over their lives like like so many times think about how
54:33
if I full church at Revival events there will be um a mother or a father and their
54:41
children standing there and their children have all this oppression and the parent has all this oppression and
54:47
the parent just simply says I renounce I renounce this I renounce this
54:53
I renounce this and as the parent renounces the child is falling back with
55:00
the power of God being delivered so this is the power that you
55:06
have when you're spiritually connected spouses we've seen this with spouses many times I've seen this with spouses many times where one spouse starts to
55:13
renounce and the other spouse is being delivered all of a sudden because they
55:18
are connected in the spiritual realm there is a tie in the spiritual
55:23
realm so um if there can be that much power with
55:30
renouncing there also can be so much power on the other side of calling them
55:36
into the kingdom Hallelujah
55:42
so renounce for your for your family members for your like speak this aloud
55:49
because you're connected and also call them into the kingdom and have patience have patience
55:58
have patience have patience um because the thing that
56:03
should help you have patience is realizing how gentle God is and so like
56:12
there are some people that are quicker than others to lose their stubbornness
56:18
right there's others who are holding on to stubbornness and God's patient with that
56:25
right God doesn't Force so so have patience with God like he
56:32
knows what he's doing he's pursuing them he's appearing to them he's making
56:38
himself known to them he hasn't given up on them but he's having to go slower with them slower than with you slower
56:45
than with other people but it's going to it's going to happen believe it will happen believe it
56:51
will happen believe that there's so much power in this connection they have with
56:57
you you know I mean my parents had so much influence over my life my parents
57:04
raised me to serve the Lord my parents had such an influence over me for good
57:12
because we're connected as a family in the spiritual realm so in the same way your spouse
57:20
your children you have power and authority in
57:26
the spiritual realm in their life use it and at the same time be patient know
57:34
God is working it may take longer than I want but I believe it's going to happen
57:39
and in the meantime I'm going to be patient I'm not going to be I can still be walking in Abundant Life I'm not
57:44
going to be distracted by the fact that it's not timing yet for
57:50
them don't be distracted be at peace Trust trust God and keep using your
57:57
Authority and speaking life over them calling them into the kingdom and also the other thing
58:04
powerful thing you can do is just keep being the brightest light of Jesus you can be keep being the most loving um
58:10
because then that's going to make your family members to want to open up more to you and to desire what you have to be
58:18
drawn towards you so instead of being like stubborn like not even looking towards you now they're like in inspired
58:25
and Desiring what you have and um just
58:31
overcome by the change in you and in awe of the love they're experiencing through
58:37
you it's God's love It's Supernatural love and you can't not notice a supernatural Godly love deep down seeds
58:45
are being planted and they are noticing and it's captivating them it's
58:53
capturing their hearts even if they're not letting on when you really make it
59:00
your mission to be the brightest light you can be into Love Like
59:06
Jesus called to finance the kingdom but our living paycheck to
59:11
paycheck what to do have been
59:17
sewing so God commands us to tithe first of all and he does want us to give more
59:23
than 10% absolutely then there can be there can be come times in life where like you don't even have like 10% Like
59:29
The the bills that you have to pay it doesn't add up and there comes a point where we need
59:37
to realize this isn't adding up and God isn't going to just pour
59:44
money from the the sky I mean there can be sometimes where you're stuck and um
59:51
there just isn't enough and you trust God and you do what that woman did um that Jesus just commended her for of
59:59
giving all she had the last the last of her money just a few just a few coins
1:00:04
but was all she had and so she gave like a 100% of what she had and and it was
1:00:10
little you know and and God just commends her for the Jesus commends her
1:00:15
for this and so there's there's times where like God will call you to do that
1:00:21
there's situations where God will will call you to do that and he's going to supernaturally provide um the money you
1:00:28
need for bills and food and everything after that but this isn't how we're
1:00:33
supposed to live every week we are not supposed to just um have
1:00:40
a job that doesn't pay that we know does not P does not add up to pay all of our
1:00:48
bills and just continue to live life like that and
1:00:54
expect God to just rain down money from the sky no we have to walk in wisdom and we
1:01:01
have to believe that God will open up doors for a higher pain job that will make ends to meet there'll be different
1:01:08
seasons of life where God it's not the time to have this like super high pain
1:01:15
job where you have everything you need and you're able to give so much to the
1:01:20
work of God on top of that like that's not going to be everyone's calling immediately right um some for many
1:01:27
people especially you know it's not the easiest thing to get a great highing
1:01:32
really high paying job especially if you live in a place like LA right and the cost of living is so high
1:01:39
um it's just not like really uh easy
1:01:44
right to just just find a really high paying job with the the skills that you
1:01:50
have they're just not that many it's not like it's easy so there will be Seasons that God different seasons that God
1:01:55
takes you through um and will take you glory to glory where where you will get to the
1:02:03
place where you're definitely far beyond just paycheck to paycheck but um it's important for you
1:02:10
to to really look at the job you have and if it's not
1:02:17
adding up to just simply walk in wisdom and it's like it's like Common Sense
1:02:23
wisdom to look for a higher paying job it doesn't mean you're looking for something
1:02:28
unrealistic that you're looking for this really really high paying job that's going to be fun that you're going to
1:02:34
love sometimes sometimes it's going to mean it's not a job that you will enjoy very much for a season that's what God's
1:02:40
calling you to I had many jobs I um at
1:02:45
when I first came to La I was um host I was hostessing back in
1:02:51
Upstate New York I was waitressing at a bunch of couple places places and I was
1:02:57
nannying and um I worked for a wedding planner one time and I did lift I drove
1:03:03
lift I drove um Postmates I've done all of these things and not one of them did
1:03:11
I love some of them I enjoyed more than others but all of them I remember thinking like oh Lord I don't I can't
1:03:19
wait till my dreams come true I can't wait till I'm able to do what you really called me to do I don't enjoy this n Fun
1:03:24
like I would have those moments very regularly for all of these jobs some it
1:03:30
would be every day having those thoughts this is
1:03:36
life and I I hate to break it to you but or I have to Brak it to you I guess I
1:03:42
should say like this is life this is this is part of stretching God uses different things to stretch us and for
1:03:50
most of us for most of us we're going to have to get jobs because because the
1:03:55
Bible talks about those who don't work will not eat like we have to get jobs so
1:04:03
we can eat we have to do work that's not fun that we don't want to do for certain
1:04:10
Seasons but there will come a time where you were you were completely walking in the fullness of your purpose doing
1:04:17
exactly what God has called you to do and you're going to love it amen and even when you get to that place even
1:04:23
this even like even when you get to that place it doesn't mean that you are like rejoicing all the time this is so much
1:04:30
fun there's anything that God's calling you to do there's going to be days where you don't feel like doing it there's
1:04:35
going to be days where you way rather rather like do something fun on vacation work is work work is work so there's
1:04:42
going to be I mean we have to get a fantasy out of our mind that like every
1:04:49
day is going to be fun and you know we just got to we just got
1:04:54
got to be hard workers we just got to um be strong and just do it just just do it
1:05:03
amen so anyways um if you are in a place right now where you are seeing this job
1:05:11
isn't adding up so that I'm unable to pay my bills I'm also like unable to
1:05:17
really tithe too um you should take that seriously not just because it may even
1:05:23
be impacting your health maybe you're only able to afford like food that's not that healthy you know
1:05:29
like that can literally affect your health so not just that but it's affecting your spiritual life because
1:05:34
God instructs us to tithe and he gave us a mind to to use
1:05:42
like you have to use your mind and realize I need to look for a higher pain
1:05:48
job and I believe God will provide a higher pain job um I believe it will out
1:05:54
there it probably won't be it it doesn't mean it's going to be some amazing job that I'm going to love that's going to
1:06:00
be riding tons of money no but I know there's something out there that will
1:06:06
that will at least get me to out of the deficit and starting to go into the
1:06:12
Abundant Life area when it comes to finances even if it's just a little bit over the um the negatives it's a start
1:06:21
don't despise the day of Small Beginnings it's a start start um so this is wisdom I'm sharing with you just real
1:06:28
prophetic advice I'm sharing with some of you some of you are missing out on spiritual blessings that God has for you
1:06:34
through reaping because you're not sewing because you are being lazy and not uh getting a job that a different
1:06:42
job that maybe won't be fun maybe will be stretching but you're not getting it and so you're
1:06:49
missing out on spiritual blessings that come from reaping so this is this is just sometimes God speaks a prophetic
1:06:55
word in a moment and this is a prophetic word right now like if this is you God is speaking he wants to pour many
1:07:02
blessings in your life he wants to answer your prayers but it can't come your way it can't come your way it's
1:07:09
requiring you to obey him it's requiring you to be strong it's requiring to use the staff that's in your hand as God
1:07:15
said to Moses use what's in your hand use your brain go to work look for different jobs that pay more they they
1:07:21
are out there you have favor on your life God is going to provide for you a better more high paying job than you
1:07:27
have now it might not be your dream job it probably won't be yet but it will
1:07:34
provide for God will provide for you through this you'll be able to sew more
1:07:39
and so you can reap more and there will be purpose there God will use you to touch other people there people will be
1:07:45
brought into the kingdom there and so even though it's not fun you're going to be really making uh a a difference in
1:07:52
the kingdom of God there have that mindset trust God and take the step take
1:07:58
the step this is the year that the promise will be fulfilled but the prophetic direction is you have to take the
1:08:04
step and and that can mean other areas in life you are not taking the step you
1:08:10
got to take the step in all the areas God is asking you to take the step
1:08:17
amen I want to declare right now over you some of you who are
1:08:24
who this word is for you and you have been stuck financially you have been stuck
1:08:32
and really the reason you've been so stuck is because of the job you're at
1:08:37
it's it it's it it it can't be sustainable it it
1:08:43
cannot it's leading you to be it's even causing you to be like grumpy and Moody
1:08:50
and down because this job is not providing enough it's not the place
1:08:55
you're supposed to be you need to be at a different place and so I declare right now I declare right now doors to open up
1:09:03
now in the spiritual realm I I call these jobs now I call this job to you
1:09:10
now I declare it will come to you now as you take the step as you do the work as
1:09:16
you go and look you spend time you spend energy to go and look May favor be upon
1:09:24
you may you get this job even that's um beyond the skills that you have maybe
1:09:30
you think I don't know if I would really get this I declare favor to be upon you and I speak this door to open up for a
1:09:38
job that will provide more than enough for your bills for your monthly costs of
1:09:45
living I declare this door to open up now for this job in Jesus
1:09:52
name amen do you drink coffee is it bad to do
1:09:58
it no it's not bad to do it it's just you shouldn't you should do everything with moderation you can have sugar but
1:10:03
have it with moderation don't have too much you can have a little bit though that's okay maybe you're convicted not
1:10:09
have any at all that's good too you can have coffee maybe you're convicted to have coffee at all that's fine but you
1:10:15
can have coffee just not too much just don't be addicted to it don't rely on it to give you energy um we it's okay to
1:10:22
think oh it'll I'll have a little bit more energy with this coffee that's not a bad thing to think it's not like um
1:10:31
Holy Spirit I know holy spirit is the only one that will give me energy it's not bad to think that but you shouldn't rely on it you know you shouldn't rely
1:10:39
on coffee to give you energy but if it gives if the caffeine you feel a little bit you don't don't need to feel like
1:10:46
guilty about it or something um as if like I'm getting energy that's not from God like you don't need to feel guilty
1:10:51
about that no but don't be don't be riant upon it like if you've already had
1:10:57
one cup of coffee and you're like I want to feel more energy oh I'm feeling tired don't have more and more and more
1:11:03
because then you're relying on it and it can be addictive so sugar can be addictive coffee can be addictive these
1:11:10

1:11:16
moderation is is absolutely fine I declare over all of you who have
