Intro
0:00
does God still move how he moved in order to bring the Egyptians out the last
0:06
plague or is that Old Testament um really really when it comes
0:15
to God need God God's plans God needing to do what he wants to do he's God and
Gods plans
0:23
so there's not any like really rule for what God can or cannot do but
0:31
it's kind of I mean for us to think about it it's just kind of more simple that we should think about it um like
0:38
when God wants to accomplish something he will accomplish it and um he many
0:43
times asks his people his children to be obedient and to
0:51
cooperate and he gives them chances and he gives them time and he has so much
0:57
grace he gives them lots of time many times but if if like God wants to do
1:04
something and his people are saying no or people are saying no then it's not
1:13
like God's hands are tied God Will Make A Way God will make sure it happens that
1:20
he will do what he what he needs to do as I shared the prophetic word um in
1:29
October of the season right now in this revival that it's time for the Baton to
1:36
be passed from the older generation to the newer Generation Um in this end time Revival
1:43
and God was is asking his the older older leaders older generation to do
1:49
that and in the prophetic word I shared that he's he's
1:55
asking but if if the people will not be obedient he will will he will take the
2:00
Baton by force meaning um the places that they are they are
2:07
holding on to or um you know not allowing there to be new generation in
2:14
these places God will make sure that that happens either
2:21
way so it's something we should have the fear of God in When God says to do something
2:27
because he he will make sure it's done whether we will agree or not whether we
2:32
will be obedient or not why are my days so up and down one day I'm energized and the next day I'm
Why are my days down
2:39
dragging myself around well what's important for you to
2:45
realize is that it doesn't have to always be that way and that you have authority in the spiritual realm and
2:53
whenever you find that um that like up and down kind of in any
2:59
area maybe it's your mind just know like who I am on the days where I'm energized
3:06
and I'm excited and I'm full of Faith that's the real me that's the that's the
3:11
real me and then on those other days perhaps the enemy is
3:17
attacking um on those other days it could be
3:22
just a day that you need to do more spiritual work spiritual effort like on
3:29
good days where you're so energized those days it's like you don't have to do much in the spiritual realm you don't
3:35
have to take authority there will be days like that where we don't have to be Warrior mode like all the time and um
3:43
especially like as we are transformed more into the image of God and we become more and more spiritual and less carnal
3:50
and the devil uh like loses his
3:55
um ability to even send weapons as much
4:00
uh because we have overcome so much and we've become so strong he is not able to
4:07
attack as much that's a reward of being surrendered to God and continually walking in
4:13
Authority um he's just not allowed it's like okay it's like when you get to the
4:19
higher higher and higher level Authority where you're entrusted with anointing to cast out
4:25
demons so if you say like demon go the demons just tremble in your presence
4:31
so demons I mean they can't even come close to
4:36
you when you're at that high level Authority so that kind of gives you this like indicator like on the the daily
4:43
life of one who's strong in the spirit they're not so much dealing with this
4:51
nagging from like demons for example um there are still spiritual attacks of
4:57
course um but it's not as much like in the mind you know um so so
5:07
anyways back to when when you're when when I'm talking about when there's up and down days just know that this won't
5:15
be always like this as long as you keep being strong and keep being a warrior and keep taking your
5:21
Authority that it will be mostly all days that you are strong and energized
5:29
in the spirit naturally but before you get to that place you you have to do the
5:35
spiritual work you have to take authority so on the days when you're
5:40
dragging the days where you feel more down no this is a day I have to really go in the spirit more you have to go
5:48
more in the spirit so if you find a day that you know you're dragging more don't be down don't be discouraged and don't
5:54
think this is just how my day is going to be you know you have authority you can take authority take action in the
6:01
spiritual realm reject the devil's lies and reject even just the the the the way you're feeling
6:09
the down way that you feeling and declare the truth speak speak the truth speak the words of
6:17
life I am full of the Holy Spirit I have the joy of the Lord is it is my strength
6:25
and I have energy I have I have victory
6:30
speak those words and you will see your soul follow having to follow your spirit
6:37
is it possible that God's asking me to be the light by working in a place where people worship other God worship another
Is it possible that Gods asking me to be the light
6:43
God or is God testing me if I will refuse to work there for
6:48
him uh yeah I mean in the worlds in the world in the workplace I
6:57
mean most jobs are not going to be be Christian own and Christian run and every single person there is worshiping
7:04
Jesus and so whether people are worshiping other gods or whether people are are foll you know being led maybe
7:13
not knowingly worshiping another God but with their lives they have Idols when
7:20
you don't when you don't have Jesus as your lord other things will be Idols
7:26
there it's like you can't not have an idol whether the idol is pleasing
7:33
yourself uh whether the idol is um romantic
7:39
partner whether the idol is drugs sex
7:44
money um really everyone's worshiping
7:50
something so we are called to be in this world but not of this world so we are
7:58
called to be be in this world we are called to be in this world we God placed Us in this world so
8:07
we're not supposed to avoid like the worlds I mean we are
8:15
called to be the light of the world a light in the darkness so we are here on
8:22
a mission to to be the light to others
8:29
let the light of Jesus Shine through us that so that others may know the hope of Jesus and may come and find Jesus
8:36
Through us so we have to be out there we
8:41
have to be out there it's going to look different for everyone and different in different seasons different seasons we will be
8:48
interacting more with people in the world than others but we have different assignments
8:53
in different seasons and all of the assignments are to be the light of the world but some will be more more closely
9:00
interacting with people that are in the world to be the light for them so um yes
9:08
that that's I mean that's absolutely absolutely uh what God wants for a lot
9:14
of people is to have a job in the world to not just only look for a Christian run company or something something but
9:22
to have a job in the world and be among people who worship other gods so that
9:28
you you can be a light and you can plant seeds you can plant seeds as you shine
9:35
your light there there can be other circumstances though where God just reveals to you
God wants me to have a job in the world
9:41
that this is really toxic for you and God wants you to look somewhere else you
9:46
know there's some places I mean there's some work environments that really the devil may
9:52
have a stronger hold on and it's just not healthy for you to be there spirit
9:59
spiritually and God may be calling you to be a light in the darkness somewhere else where it is it is like a it is
10:07
healthy it's a healthy balance like you are strong enough spiritually to be able to handle any
10:15
spiritual warfare or Darkness there so be sensitive to the Holy Spirit follow the leading of the Holy Spirit um you
10:22
know I mean just like some people are called to go into really dark places but they are equipped for that and then
10:28
other people they aren't called to go into quite that dark of a place because they won't be able they won't be strong
10:35
enough to be to shine their light and the Darkness will more have more power
10:40
over them so you have to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit do we need an
Do we need an accountability partner
10:45
accountability partner a mentor or friend that can speak truth to you when you need to hear it well it's not quite
10:53
like a I mean it shouldn't be like a religious a religious thing where it's
10:58
like I need to find an accountability partner in every season of my life like there can be Seasons
11:05
where where God is calling you I mean there can be a season where he's taking you from Abram land to Abraham land and
11:13
there's like this in between time where God he called you to shed old wine skin
11:19
shed old relationships and you honestly didn't have a single friend in your life that
11:27
was equally yolked that was surrendered to God okay so then he can be all of a
11:32
sudden all of a sudden you surrendered and all of a sudden he's calling you to shed the Abram
11:38
land what I'm talking about is in the story in the there's a story in the Bible where Abram was given a new name
11:45
by God Abraham and he had made promises to him but he's telling him I'm calling
11:52
you to a different land and the promises will be fulfilled in your life when you go to this new land so he changed his
11:59
name and he he wanted to change his location so he was really becoming a completely different person and it
12:05
required him to change everything to change who who was close to him in his
12:10
life and the old friends were not going to they were not going to be able to come to him to come with him in the new
12:17
land and if he tried to bring them they would hold him back so it's very
12:23
important he did what God Said and followed these instructions and and shed
12:29
the old wine skin shed the old friendships so you can be a time in your life where you're surrendered and God's
12:35
saying you to just shed all of these all of these people aren't surrendered to God and they're
12:42
they're not going to be good for you spiritually they're going to be an open door for the enemy and they're not going to help you they're not going to be Iron
12:47
sharpening iron um and but but many times God can't immediately entrust you
12:54
with with spiritually strong mature people yet because he cares about them too he he he wants you to be um safe for
13:03
them too so so sometimes there can be this in between time
13:10
of just you and God and this is part of the refining
13:15
fire trusting him trusting in Him um believing that he will bring you
13:24
good people and that this is just temporary and
Do you have an accountability partner
13:30
this can be part of growing in intimacy with God to get to this place where it's just you and God and that's
13:36
enough so um that's why I say I think sometimes it can be kind of
13:43
a religious thing like do you have an accountability partner like it shouldn't be a religious thing um follow the
13:50
leading of the Holy Spirit but in general I mean the Bible says iron sharpens iron
13:57
meaning when there are equally yolked when there's Divine equally yolked friendships this is important this is
14:06
God ordained this this helps strengthen your faith this helps keep you in God's will
14:14
um when if you are being spiritually attacked and feeling down and and more
14:20
vulnerable and weak but you have a strong friend strong in the spirit
14:26
friend mature equally Yol surrender to God and in that moment they encourage
14:32
you they are a vessel of God to Speak Life to you um they can really help you
14:37
have Victory God can use them to help give you Victory to strengthen you so
14:43
it's a good and beautiful and important thing um for the for for most seasons of
14:49
Life uh but um it's important for it to be organically and not forced and not be
14:55
like I need to find an accountability partner and then you're trying to force it and then it can be the wrong person
15:01
it can be someone that isn't the highest standard that God wanted you to have and just because you're that's the that's
15:08
the problem with religion is when you're like trying to force things just like going by rules it like can cause us to lower our
15:16
standards and and and and and like accept something that's not completely pure um accept something where now
15:24
there's a open door for the enemy to come an attack do parents have the authority
Do parents have authority to cast out demons
15:32
to cast out demons in their older children if so can I do it remotely and
15:38
unknowingly so when when children are it's different
15:45
when children are younger because a parent has more authority over
15:55
them until when they become an adult they're now really H having their own
16:02
free will God it free will is important to God so when children become older
16:07
they really have their own free will and authority over their own lives and so a
16:13
big part of a person receiving Deliverance
16:19
is their own personal desire for it surrender to God
16:25
um Deliverance is the children's bread the ible says and so Deliverance is one
16:32
of the the uh one of the gifts from Jesus
16:39
it's part of the inheritance that Jesus has given us of Abundant Life it's part
16:44
of what he has done for us on the cross what was purchased on the cross healing
16:50
by his Tripes we are healed and freed healed and freed so um we receive
16:58
deliverance and healing by our acceptance of Jesus and our acceptance
17:04
of Jesus in his fullness what he has given us deliverance and healing so some people
17:11
they're they're accepting they're accepting part of Jesus but they're not
17:16
accepting this precious gift of healing and deliverance because of lack of faith so that's that's a big key for
17:24
many people is they need to desire it deliverance and desire Jesus in his
17:30
fullness Jesus the deliverer themselves so
17:35
um that it's it's important so so a big thing that we can
17:41
do in that area so that we can see them desire and want and receive Jesus the
17:49
deliverer is to show them love the kindness of God leads to
17:55
repentance and so being a vessel of God showing unconditional
18:02
love that's the best thing we can do planting seeds that's the real powerful
18:07
thing we can do not being forceful but being like Jesus and showing them that
18:14
undeserving unconditional love it will do tremendous things in the spiritual realm that will lead to them
18:21
transforming repenting Desiring full Freedom um however really whenever
18:29
I mean our prayers are powerful and our sewing is powerful sewing is like
18:34
putting putting wait and action upon prayers sewing in God's kingdom where
18:40
his true anointing is the Bible talks about whatever you sew you will reap so
18:46
as you sew seeds for certain prayer requests certain things that you have it's it's believing God I believe in
18:53
your anointing I believe in your kingdom I believe in sewing in your kingdom that
18:59
there is a reaping that comes from sewing in your kingdom and we need we need so much of his anointing in
19:06
in many different areas and so sometimes there's more of a need of his anointing in in a certain area and so when we so
19:14
we are we are believing we are reaping more of his anointing more from his kingdom upon
19:23
these needs and so when you have a certain prayer request like a prayer
19:30
request of a family member there is power in your seeds what's important is
19:35
to there's power in your prayer and your seeds call them into the kingdom declare
19:41
I mean call them into the kingdom of God where they will be completely free like
19:47
speak those words there's power in that there's power in that but above above
19:52
all I just I want to say it's so important to understand there's so much power in God's principles but at the but
19:58
we also have to understand it's not like a transaction it's not
20:03
magic um at the end of the day people have free will but it's like we can our
20:09
prayers are powerful our sewing's powerful and being a vessel of God and
20:15
planting seeds of kindness of Love is All powerful so we do all these things and
20:22
we put our trust in God we we know he is a good god and we know we are are doing
20:28
our part and we leave the rest in God's hands we we operate in faith we operate
20:35
in trust in God and we operate in patience rather
20:40
than um being feeling
What should I do if my husband is like
20:45
entitled you know feeling operating in like a transactional way in your mind
20:52
but operating in faith and humility and patience what should I do if my husband
20:58
is like really angry at me about something that really isn't a big deal I left a like left a bucket with water and
21:05
it fell on the floor so anytime okay so
21:12
anytime this would be a situation that you are you are being treated unfairly you
21:20
are you don't deserve to be treated wrongly and we're all going to go
21:27
through that and it's going to look different for all of us and in some cases in your case this could be your
21:35
spouse every time we go through this where someone treats us wrongly something we don't deser
21:42
deserve this is an opportunity for us to grow this is a test this is a test every
21:49
time you see that happen every time you see that happen where someone is you don't you don't deserve to be treated
21:55
wrongly and they're treating you wrongly false accusation maybe um you can know
22:01
this is a test how will I respond right now God's watching I want to make him
22:07
proud this is a this is a chance for me to go higher in the spiritual real it's
22:12
a chance for me to make God proud it's a chance for me to be more refined and
22:18
grow so you the way to be spiritual is to see every situation like that in that
22:26
lens and that's it's exciting it's exciting it's in the worldly way it's like this
22:34
is awful this is not fair this is unjust I'm offended I'm grieved how
22:43
could this person treat me like this I thought they loved me this is not
22:48
love that's the carnal way to see it and I mean a lot of those things
22:54
they're true but we don't have to see it in that perspective we can take the other perspective the spiritual
23:01
perspective and be like Jesus be like him his kingdom is not of
23:10
this world it's supernatural so you can take the supernatural route go higher and use
God will turn it around
23:18
this use this for good with the Enemy meant for harm God will turn it around for
23:23
good and um also when a situation like that happens
23:29
I know it can be hard if it's especially if it's a spouse it's someone you
23:35
love you got to understand that this is
23:40
spiritual it's spiritual I mean for some people there is actually demonic oppression it could be demonic oppression of Rage where
23:48
they're like possessed in that moment I mean they're they're they don't want to do that but there's a force overtaking
23:55
them in that moment to be mean to be angry when it's so silly
24:01
to be angry over um so in that case we it really
24:07
helps us to not take offense because we realize it isn't even the person really
24:12
if the case is demonic oppression and it's really the enemy but in other cases maybe it's not demonic
24:20
oppression but the person has to deny their flesh more they haven't been
24:25
denying their flesh so much they're not as strong spiritual their flesh their carnal nature is stronger in that area
24:33
they have spiritual work to do so um even in that case it helps you
24:40
to not be offended and show love to the person
24:45
because it's still spiritual it's it's it it's doesn't mean that they want to
24:50
be that way it doesn't mean that they don't love you um it could mean that
24:58
maybe they haven't they haven't had the grace that you've had of encountering God's love maybe it could be that their
25:05
spiritual eyes haven't opened up enough yet so that they can be transformed more
25:11
into the image of God and become more spiritual um it could be that you know
25:18
you you are growing at a faster pace and they're they're not but they're still growing and we still have Grace for them
Show them love
25:26
and hope and amen and um a big way that a big a big
25:33
way that we can have that we can help their growth is by showing them the love of Jesus when they don't deserve it like
25:40
when someone treats you wrongly is angry at you for no good
25:45
[Music] reason they're expecting I mean they know that many times they know most
25:52
people know when they're acting wrong like they know or they'll know after the
25:57
fact at least that they shouldn't have acted in that way so in the moment
26:03
they're expecting a response of offense
26:09
um getting back what they lashed out you know anger coming back at them they're
26:14
expecting it the only way that that would not happen is if someone is
26:20
transformed to be like Jesus and that's rare many people haven't encountered
26:25
that so when you can show them that love show them that Grace show them that unconditional love they will notice they
26:33
will be amazed surprised curious it will plant a seed they are
26:41
receiving the love of Jesus when whenever someone does something uh bad wrong to another person
26:48
they know what they deserve back but when you show them grace
26:53
mercy unconditional love Supernatural love back in that
27:00
moment that's them encountering the love of Jesus and for some people they might not have ever encountered that till that
27:07
moment and that plants tremendous seeds it plants tremendous seeds to feel that
27:14
feeling of I didn't deserve that what is This Love that plants tremendous seeds
27:23
so in those moments know that responding in this way taking the higher
27:29
road is doing massive things in the spiritual realm for you and for the
27:36
person who did those wrong things to you have patience because maybe you also
27:44
you can remember how you have been transformed maybe you used to be that way or maybe it wasn't anger that you
27:50
weren't as were weaken I mean you know that was your weakness but maybe it was
27:55
something else that you had a weakness and but you don't anymore when I get treated unfair by my
Sharing
28:02
family and tell my husband about it does that mean I'm complaining I want to share with him everything but not sure
28:07
if that's complaining so when it comes to this
28:13
it's Case by case and it's following the leading of the Holy Spirit when you have
28:19
someone that you are equally yolked with they are spiritually mature um like when you know that this person
28:27
doesn't have the heart to gossip and to speak against another person or to think
28:33
bad about another person but they have a heart to see someone restored and they have a heart
28:39
of forgiveness like if that's their heart and if that's your heart which it should be if you're at that place then
28:47
to share with someone that God has called you to bring in really close
28:53
equally yolked to share with them something that happened in a place of
29:00
transparency and in and in a place of just maybe you would probably just only share it to that one person kind of
29:06
thing just to share with them what's going on in your life and in in the
29:11
heart of nothing but love for the other person
29:17
like that you're sharing it not in the spirit of Gossip that you're sharing it not in the spirit of I feel bad for
29:24
myself and I want I want this person close in my life to
29:30
um like make me feel better cuz I feel so bad bad that they did this to me you
29:38
know as long as that's not the spirit but you're just sharing it in a transparent way and you're sharing it in
29:44
the spirit of love and you know you're speaking life in the situation like just
29:50
being real like this happened but um I bless them I pray for them you know
29:56
maybe you're sharing this was a test for me I God tested me today this was um
30:02
something hard I had to go through um but God gave me strength and I'm I'm
30:10
praying for them and God taught me something through this you know maybe you're just when you share in that way
30:17
then it's okay but the the spirit of Gossip is is what's wrong the spirit of
30:23
Gossip is when you're not coming with love not coming
30:29
with love for the other person so when you've been hurt by someone maybe you're not feeling all sorts of love but
30:36
feelings of love but it doesn't mean that you are wanting
30:41
bad for the person too so to share about an experience you've had that's okay but
30:47
it's really important that you're only sharing with the person that God is calling you to share it with usually it
30:53
probably just be probably for the most part like one person usually um depending um if God if God is is calling
31:01
I mean if God is allowing that if something like that happens when you are just sharing with a lot of people that's
31:07
when it's gossip that's when it's really not good that's when it's planting Bad Seeds I mean we are never called to um
31:17
you know paint someone in a bad picture um cause there to be a bad narrative
31:24
towards somebody even if it's true even if they've done bad you know that's
31:30
we're not called to that we're called to love and restore and um love our enemies
31:36
so when one shares with several people
31:41
something like bad about someone that's when it is wrong it's the spirit of gossip and it's
31:48
it's that doing what the enemy wants is for people to think badly about
31:56
somebody how to balance between offering advice and not having a plank in your eye so the
How to balance
32:02
scripture there's a scripture that talks about um you know stop looking at the speck in
32:11
your brother's eye or neighbor's eye when there's a plank in your own eye and
32:18
um I mean that scripture is really really really so much speaking of when you're coming with a spirit of
32:24
judgment when um I mean people that come with judgment and judging something they
32:30
don't really know it's not their place to judge um taking things out of context
32:35
and they know it I mean they're just T I mean this happens so much today in the world of like exposed videos and
32:41
everything like they don't know a person and they take a little click baity little thing and they're all of a sudden
32:48
uh professional and they act like they know the whole context and they know the
32:55
person very well um that they're
33:01
judging um they they act like a professional they act like they can be
33:07
the judge and they can say the the reality the truth of the
33:13
situation and make judgment and say this is wrong and and all of that so when I
33:19
think when that scripture um
33:24
stop stop before you deal with a speck in your brother's eyee deal with the plank in your own eye
33:31
um I I really think of those examples like that that's the really so much what
33:36
that what that scripture is saying is that there are people like that that I mean when you are coming with all of
33:43
that judgment like that um with all that Pride like you
33:50
know you're the professional in judging this situation when you really don't
33:56
know you're not you're not the professional you don't know the person and you're taking things out of context that's when you're that prideful
34:05
in that judgmental you got big issues I mean like you've
34:11
got big big flesh problems you've you
34:17
are not spiritually mature you've got a big sin going on
34:23
there in you big plank in the eye um it's it's it's bad it's really
34:32
bad to be so prideful and judgmental when we see the I
34:41
mean I you could say the most dangerous sin or one of the most dangerous sins is
34:49
to be judgmental and prideful why because what was the
34:55
worst what was the worst sin that anyone did or I don't know if you could I I I
35:02
would I think I would say it worst worst sin maybe we can say maybe other people would be more comfortable for me to say
35:08
um one of the biggest sins but I think it's I think it's okay to say the biggest sin that anyone's ever done
35:14
would be the Pharisees uh judging Jesus wrongly and
Biggest sin
35:21
being so allowing their pride and jealousy and judgment to take over them so
35:27
much that they would come up with gross
35:33
plans to get Jesus uh on trial to be
35:39
crucified to get him to the place where he would be um scourged
35:46
beaten and placed on the cross to die and say all the nasty things about
35:54
him and and Lead so many people to hell I mean their lies Led Led people to hell even to this
36:05
day they their lies about Jesus them falsely accusing
36:10
Jesus the devil using them led to people going to hell led to people not
36:17
believing in Jesus led to people agreeing with them believing them and agreeing with them and calling him false
36:24
prophet too so I would say that was you could
36:29
probably say that's the worst worst sin so that's why it's
36:37
like people people coming with all that pride and
36:42
judgment is a plank it's automatically a plank it's not a speck to come with that
36:48
kind of um pride and judgment to be like you you you're
36:55
spec to another person it's automatically a plank it's not a speck
37:01
it's bad it's big it's a huge dangerous
37:07
sin yeah so um dealing so so sometimes
37:13
the per sometimes it is a speck but it's still smaller I mean that sin in that
37:18
person that they're judging is still smaller than this Pharisee like pride and judgment and sometimes
37:26
it's not even a spec sometimes there's nothing there but they perceive it as a
37:32
sin in someone they perceive it as a spec yeah so that is just a first little
37:37
explanation about the plank in your ey so the question is how to balance between offering advice and not having a
37:44
plank in your eye so [Music] um now that we understand plank in your
37:51
eye now I can answer this question because um how to make sure you don't
37:57
have a plank in your eye when offering advice is to make sure that it's your place to
38:03
offer advice to make sure that you're confident in this
38:09
advice you're you have humility and a Godly confidence in this advice you know
38:16
with humility you have confidence that God has you God's taught you this and so
38:23
that you can now offer this advice a good way to be sure that you've learned this is
38:33
that it falls in order that it falls in order of what you have learned under
38:38
your covering so like for example me as your leader for those of
38:46
you who I am your leader I am your spiritual mother if I have taught
38:52
something and now someone has a question about something in your life life and
38:57
you you know the answer you know that you've received this answer maybe through a Q&A or something I've taught
39:04
you can have confidence like God has I've definitely learned this I know this
39:10
to be true it's in order it's I've received it under my
39:15
covering I I you know that's when you can have that Godly confidence so yes God can teach us
39:22
things and speak things to us in our spirit speak things to us in the word but we want to be extra humble to make
39:30
sure like if it hasn't come through I I I if if a teaching hasn't come in that
39:38
order of your covering your Your Leader speaking
39:43
it it doesn't mean that you know you can't still receive wisdom and and
39:49
teaching from God in through your spirit and in your and in the word but it does mean that it requires more humility to
39:59
to make sure that it's you really heard rightly like we should not be quick we
40:04
should not be quick to become like teachers and um give advice
40:11
when it's it hasn't it's just come by the spirit and by the word and and it we
40:18
want to make sure it's really coming from God I just say that because so so
40:24
so often with the old wine skin um the old wine there's religion there's wrong
40:31
Doctrine there and so that's why I say it's it's better to be humble it's
40:38
better to to not be a teacher too quick and in terms of offering advice that's
40:43
can be in the form of being a teacher right so um when it comes to hearing
40:51
from God in the word and God speaking to your spirit um some things are pure and
40:57
it's the new wine you have the new wine skin and you're hearing the voice of God
41:02
accurately uh but there could be sometimes where maybe it's your own emotions sometimes it could be the angel
41:09
of Light it depends on person upon person and it depends upon your past like how entrenched you were in the old
41:16
wine if you were really entrenched in the old wine and like if God has opened
41:21
up your eyes that you had a lot of wrong religious
41:27
old winkin Doctrine in you from what people have taught you but
41:34
also yourself and maybe angel of Light you discovered that that is a that
41:40
should be speaking to you I got to be careful you know I I got to be extra
41:46
humble extra teachable extra childlike like you got to really put
41:53
yourself at a lower level like kinderg garton level you know if you know that's
41:59
your past to just be safe to make sure you're really delivering God's word
42:07
accurately when it comes to delivering his word and that there's no old
42:12
religious Doctrine old wines skin mixed in how do you break up with friends that
42:18
you love but know isn't good for you um you don't have to tell them
42:23
everything like you don't have to be like listen we're not equally yolked anymore
42:30
I'm growing at just like at a faster Pace than you I'm more surrendered to God than you like that could be the
42:36
truth and you're not being prideful like that's just the truth you know but you don't have to like say that you don't
42:42
have to to tell them all that um because you want to be gentle and loving to them
42:48
and um sometimes that's not loving to reveal all that even though it's true
42:55
you know and you know it they wouldn't really understand so um the best thing
Surrender to God
43:02
to do is to just I mean this is the truth you are surrendered to God now in
43:08
a deeper level than before if you're at that place where God is calling you to end close friendships to to put
43:17
boundaries up uh with certain friends in your life that means that you are surrendered more than ever okay and so
43:23
surrender to God looks like surrender in every area it looks like being a servant
43:29
of him it looks like freeing up your time for him making space in your life
43:34
for him that's what surrender looks like and so what you can say is something
43:41
like you've surrendered to God like never before and God is calling you in this into a new
43:48
season uh a season of sacrifice and surrender and serving him like never
43:53
before and it's requiring that to be so much more space and time in your life to
43:59
give to him personal time with him and also time to serve him so you
44:08
aren't going to have you don't have the time anymore to hang out like you used
44:13
to um so you can you can say something
44:18
like that it's going to depend on the case I mean some some situations some person may be really toxic and unhealthy
44:24
and um manipula in everything so in that case it's it's kind of it's necessary to
44:31
be more short you know and sometimes even to like block a person might be
44:38
necessary if they're being so like used by the enemy and toxic and manipulating
44:44
and and like that you know so it just depends on the case but
44:50
in general like to start sharing that which it is the truth you know but
44:55
you're you're not having to give like every little detail and so you're able to show love to them in that way by
45:01
sharing how you're in a different season right now and God's requiring all of your time that you weren't giving as
45:09
much before you need to give it to him by serving him and spending time with him and so you aren't you aren't going
45:14
to be able to hang out like before but I love you and I bless you and I'm praying for you and just saying it in a way
45:21
where they they they it's communicated to them that things will be different now
45:26
um and sometimes you could start with that and then you you know maybe they'll they'll
45:32
reach out and say you know can you hang out and you say no you know and they'll start it'll it'll communicate to them
45:40
that things really are different and in most cases they will understand and they
45:45
will they will respect if there's not respect that's
45:52
when it that's when it's important to you know know do be more like short
45:58
really put boundaries firmly up and everything and holy spirit will lead you or not short but direct you
46:08
know does it matter to Jesus the specific subject to study in school so
46:13
first of all before I answer this question I first want to say watch the
46:19
sermon that I shared in um I don't know when it was I think
46:25
it was maybe it was in the summertime or the fall I think like the summer or fall time summer or fall time but it's called
46:32
I think it's called made in the image of God it's a sermon I shared so that is
46:38
going to really answer this question more in depth I'm going to give you a quick a short version short answer right
46:46
now um and that's that we are made in the image of God and God is a Creator
46:53
and he has made us in His image as to create and he's made us in in His image
46:59
of having our own brain and heart and um when it comes to so so there will be
47:07
times when God wants you to do something
47:12
specifically there there came a time where God wanted me to be an apostle and
47:18
to start fivefold church so in terms of like job-wise career-wise purpose like
47:26
that God wanted me to do specifically that at that
47:31
time um but that doesn't come when we want it many times it comes in God's
47:39
timing uh before God releases something very specific and
47:46
concrete for example this is what like your job career
47:52
purpose is to be the rest of your life like something like that that before God
47:57
releases that it's not going to be a situation where God's releasing other things like
48:05
I want you to do this now and God's going to speak in an audible voice you are to do this now but God's more
48:14
um God what's really important to God is that like for me like the
48:19
apostle that calling but the things before it didn't matter so much
48:27
exactly what um I was doing before but What mattered was that I was surrendered
48:33
to God and that I was being a light for him and that I was being a vessel of him
48:39
but what God wanted me to do like in that season before was to make uh
Making wise decisions
48:47
Decisions by being made in His image make wise decisions so you know what what's what
48:55
what job would I like to do but that would also that I would have passion in some passion in that would make a
49:02
difference that I could be a vessel of God in that I could plant seeds in what
49:09
job but but what but it would also pay the bills that okay I know this is how much
49:16
rent is and everything and all my bills so I have to make sure I'm looking for a job that covers those things and go find
49:24
you know that's what God is wanting his people to do um including Holy Spirit in
49:30
that but many time usually it won't be like God saying work here we we many
49:37
times want it to be but as we Are Made In His Image it's like God can use us in
49:43
so many different areas and many times we don't realize that we don't think that but God can use
49:48
us in many different areas and he wants us being made it in His image to make wise
49:54
decisions um so like for me I remember
50:00
um going trying to figure out what I want what what to study in college and I was I loved God I wasn't completely
50:06
surrendered at that point but I had never encountered God's power yet but I still just I wanted to be in his
50:12
will and um I ended up deciding to to study
50:18
Communications communication management design it was what it was called and honestly I didn't know what to do um as
50:25
a career my biggest passion was acting and singing and but I was thinking I don't know if I should go to college for
50:30
that um maybe I should go to college for something like more practical or
50:35
something like you know that's what was in my mind and then someone someone's was going to be a
50:42
wedding planner and I was like that sounds that sounds awesome maybe I would like to do that but it was nothing like
50:48
concrete because the only passions I had were singing and acting I didn't really have any other passions beside that besides God so I went with this idea of
50:57
an event planner maybe maybe I'll be good at that and like that I didn't really know for sure so I I studied
51:03
Communications throughout school and with this idea of thinking that that's what I would um that's what I would do
51:10
be an event planner hopefully that would work out hopefully I would like it hopefully I would be good at it but I I wasn't quite fully sure um
51:19
but God God um used used that I mean I I
51:26
I I led worship for the first time in that college um I I I I shared a message for
51:33
the first time in that college it was more like sharing a testimony um and and God brought me closer to him
51:41
there I I started in that place I I
51:46
hungered to have a relationship with God like never before and it was there that I started
51:51
to have intimacy with God have I never knew having a relationship with God was
51:57
and I started to learn a little bit there and started to have a relationship with God there so looking back I look
God is so wise
52:03
back at it and I see that God wasn't really concerned too much about my about my major but um he was concerned about
52:11
my heart in that season of my life and getting closer to him and God used that
52:17
you know and that's just for me it's different for everybody so this example of me is not going to be for everyone
52:22
but just for me I just look back and I see that it wasn't a waste it's not like I studied the wrong thing or anything um
52:30
I didn't end up being an event planner but um but God used used it all
52:36
for good and then when I um after I
52:41
graduated college it really hit me that I didn't believe God was calling me to
52:47
be an event planner and I just decided to pursue acting and singing because I didn't know what else to do and I was asking God I was crying out to God lord
52:53
I'll go anywhere what do you want me to do but God wasn't ready to reveal my calling to me yet it wasn't the right timing I hadn't encountered God's power
53:00
yet and I wasn't surrendered fully yet so looking back I see how God is so wise because if a prophet just showed up and
53:06
says you're called to be an apostle you're called started a church I would maybe I I would I don't know if I would
53:12
obey God or not maybe I would I would probably think who is this person prophets I don't think they are real
53:18
today that's probably what would have happened or if I did believe I I might have been grudging uh or grudgingly
53:25
doing it like like feeling like God why are you calling me to do something that
53:32
I don't want to do but once my eyes open up to God's love later in
53:38
life a few years later um and or yeah a few years later um and
53:46
and and I surrendered everything and I had this Revelation like who am I to know what's best for my life God you can
53:52
ask me to do anything and I just you're so good that that I know that whatever you call me to do will be perfect I had
53:59
that Revelation later and so then when I received my calling I was still like
54:06
what like Moses like preacher
54:13
Apostle how can I do this but at the same time I wasn't like I trusted God I
54:19
wasn't like grudgingly accepting the calling I trusted God I was like God
54:25
knows best and God will never call me to do something that he wouldn't give me a heart that he wouldn't trans transer my
God knows best
54:31
heart to have passion to do and so I just trust him and so I I say yes with a
54:39
with a happy heart though I was so I had no idea how it was going to
54:45
work and I didn't have passion for ministering but it was with a happy heart because I had so much Revelation
54:50
about God's character his love so I just was this childlike trust I had for him
54:56
but I wouldn't have had that years back so I say all that to say like his timing is so perfect and I look back on my life
55:02
and I see um I I came out to LA to pursue acting and and then music and I
55:09
had to find jobs and I was doing the part-time thing to to go to auditions
55:15
and pursue acting and then music and um so I was a
55:21
waitress cuz I'd always wanted to be a waitress so I was like following that like desire um cuz I like to interact
55:27
with people and stuff so I I did that at different couple different places and then um I wasn't enjoying that and then
55:34
it got to the place where actually it was you know serving alcohol and stuff
55:39
and I was just like after I've been baptized with Holy Spirit I felt convicted from God I can't work here anymore I can't I felt convicted um
55:47
because of that so at that point then um I felt in my heart like I love children
55:54
um maybe I could try nanning and so then I nannied for a while and um I ended up
56:02
this this last naning job I had the boy was from a Jewish Family and he I prayed
56:07
for him in the car and this is before um this was this was before I received my
56:13
prophecy and everything but I prayed for him and it was one of the first times I saw God move through me and he was
56:19
healed of like a pain in his mouth and I was like that was Jesus and he gave his life to Jesus that day and I was
56:26
discipling him in in my car and nannying him um and so there was just so much
56:32
purpose in that there was so much beautiful purpose in that so anyways I say all that to say is that um you know
56:41
invite God in with your plans of pursuing your uh pursuing career
56:46
pursuing um what you study but also also just know that like when there's not
56:52
this um concrete calling revealed yet is okay look at my
56:59
life like understand God's timing is different but also know that it's
57:04
important your life right now and what you're doing is important God wants to use it all God wants God has all these
57:10
plans that he's going to do in your in your college in your in your job um but
57:19
if you are you know if you're not getting this huge Revelation from God of a specific
57:24
calling it's okay to invite Holy Spirit in but use your brain that he's given
57:30
you and make good decisions um you know in terms of your your gifts that he's giving you your
Is it okay to study from someone who isnt Christian
57:38
passions in terms of what to pursue is it okay to study like marketing from
57:43
someone who isn't Christian and you see they believe in other things uh like tarot um yeah I
57:53
mean when we are are learning different subjects in the world that are not spiritual we don't need
57:59
to research the person completely to find out their spiritual beliefs to be learning certain tasks that have nothing
58:06
to do spiritually um that being said though still walk in the wisdom of the Holy
58:12
Spirit when there could be more options of teachers like if one if one teacher
58:18
or in terms of where you're going to be learning something from if they are if they are releasing so much
58:27
Darkness um I don't know even just with like how they how they speak how they
58:33
real teaching things or something then find another teacher you know just
58:39
follow the leading of the Holy Spirit but we are in this world but not of this world so we are not called to receive
58:46
all the different teachings of the things of the worlds from only uh
58:52
Christians that's not like a rule that we have I try to talk to my family about 5f
59:01
and they tell me my chist my Christianity is fear-based they don't want to hear about demons how do I
59:08
accept this so the Bible says that the things of the spirit the things of the
59:14
spiritual realm are foolishness to those who are
59:19
carnal so simply people's ey spiritual eyes are
59:25
opened up in different degrees some people believe that Jesus is Lord and
59:31
that's it I mean they they don't know much about the kingdom of God they don't
59:36
know really too much about Jesus they know 1% about Jesus they know that Jesus
59:42
is Lord and Savior but they don't know about Jesus the Healer Jesus the deliverer Jesus Jesus who
59:49
um Jesus who moves in new ways Jesus who is who is not
59:58
religious um Jesus who moves through men
1:00:03
and women Jesus who who moves through his servants Jesus who moves through
1:00:09
Apostles and Prophets and evangelist pastors and teachers a lot of people they don't know all these things about
1:00:15
Jesus and there these things that I'm talking about are such big Parts about Jesus so there's a lot of Christians
1:00:22
that just know a tiny percentage of Jesus and then someone like you may know
1:00:27
the majority of Jesus like Jesus's character and the things of the kingdom
1:00:33
and the main principles of the Kingdom so we got to have that understanding that um it's
1:00:40
like people who are blind spiritually it's like their eyes are shut and you're saying look at this look at this navy
1:00:49
blue shirt and the gold buttons and the gold earrings do you see this do you see
1:00:55
how it's pretty do you see this color do you and they're like
1:01:02
no their eyes simply aren't open so it's foolishness if you say if
1:01:09
someone's eyes are shut and you say look at this blue sweater do you see this
1:01:14
blue sweater do you see this navy blue color it's foolish no I see
1:01:21
black it's foolishness but you're are like so excited about it and you can see
1:01:26
so vividly and they have eyes you see their eyes so it's like I have eyes you have eyes how come you can't see this
1:01:32
like I can see this I don't get it like what you know because the this how the spiritual eyes open up that's in the
1:01:39
Unseen realm that's in the Unseen realm and so you're both watching the same
1:01:44
testimonies you're you know like one person sees the testimony and sees Jesus
1:01:50
another person sees a testimony and sees Witchcraft and sees the devil and SE SE someone making up a lie or something or
1:01:56
sees an actor you know it's the same thing and so the person with a pure heart whose eyes are opened up they
1:02:03
think you think that they're going to see the same thing that you're seeing but they're completely blind and so they
1:02:09
see the narrative that that the devil's putting in their eyes their eyes are
1:02:15
shut and it's plain black but it's plain what the devil wants them to see and this can be confusing and disheartening
1:02:21
and discouraging to us and and just confusing cuz it's like look we're seeing the same thing I don't get why
1:02:28
you don't see you have eyes you we seeing the same thing you know um but
1:02:33
that's how it is in the spiritual real so we have to like understand that spiritual truth we have to understand
1:02:39
that some people's eyes are not opened up they they cannot see yet yet they
1:02:46
cannot see how do spiritual eyes open up humility Jesus says to the father I
1:02:53
praise you father for after the demons after the demons were cast out by the disciples they came back the first time
1:02:58
saying Jesus we could cast out demons like you did the demons obeyed us and then Jesus immediately praises the
1:03:04
father and he says father I praise you for hide for revealing these things to
1:03:10
the childlike only meaning revealing the deeper things of the spiritual realm revealing uh the the the the the deeper
1:03:18
things of the of the kingdom of God the the spiritual principles and Revelations and Mysteries of how to receive the
1:03:25
anointing how to walk in the anointing um how it works in the spiritual realm
1:03:31
these the deeper things thank you for only revealing it to those who have become like children and actually hiding
1:03:37
these things from those who are Pride proud prideful know it alls Jesus says
1:03:43
this so This reveals to us how our spiritual eyes will open up how we will
1:03:49
receive Revelation how we will receive the opening of eyes to see and discern and understand and the things of the
1:03:55
spirit is by being humble and so you can know you can quickly discern the the the
1:04:02
you can quickly discern what's going on when a person cannot see in the spiritual
1:04:07
realm when what especially when you're lovingly sharing with them if you're lovingly sharing with someone gently
1:04:15
lovingly like not forcefully and you're sharing with them testimony and you're sharing them about how God changed your
1:04:21
life you're sharing with them about the Revival and everything that you've seen
1:04:26
if a person's eyes are shut yet they're humble their eyes will immediately start to open up they will receive what you're
1:04:34
saying they'll be like they'll come with a pure heart like oh wow what they're saying I've never heard before
1:04:42
but I have no reason to like be skeptical critical doubt this person is
1:04:47
speaking with passion and a pure heart and I know this person they have a pure heart you know so whoa I'm learning
1:04:56
something new today I want to know more and they'll probably ask questions and they'll come with a pure heart a
1:05:03
curiosity and God will open up their eyes immediately and hopefully they keep
1:05:09
seeking God more they keep humbling themselves more and their eyes open more and more and more and they catch up to you pretty much I mean their eyes are
1:05:15
fully open pretty soon and they're on board with Jesus and his Revival that's
1:05:22
what happens in this revival many people they go that's been the case for many of you you you you know your eyes were
1:05:28
completely shut and then one day you maybe you saw a video or something and you came with that heart of like whoa
1:05:33
I've never seen this before but wow I mean you had no why would you why why
1:05:40
would you just immediately doubt and and be skeptical of something when you have a pure heart that doesn't make sense you
1:05:45
know what I mean when you have an impure heart that's when you immediately go to judge and be skeptical when there's no
1:05:52
reason to you know um um but yeah that's that's been the case for many of you I
1:05:57
mean and your eyes open real fast that's that's how it was for me my eyes opened real fast real fast I grew so fast I
1:06:04
mean when when my eyes first opened up to the fact that God moved in power and everything it was like
1:06:11
and my eyes just instantly opened up and I mean nine months later I received the
1:06:16
prophecy over my life and I'd ran with it yes amen and you know it was I was
1:06:21
able to go fast God was able to take my eyes completely shut and just open them up wide and all the layers fast that's
1:06:30
what can happen if you have a humble heart others it's slower because their Heart's Not humble
1:06:37
others they don't open at all because their hearts are completely not humble Pride so you can have that discernment
1:06:43
that's not being judgmental I mean but you can just have that discernment of like okay this is not happening because
1:06:50
there's there's not humility in the heart there still so what you can again as I shared earlier what to do
1:06:57
in that situation if it's family show them the love of God the kindness of God leads to repentance repentance needs to
1:07:02
happen so that humility can come in the heart so just show them love just be gentle if they're not receiving these
1:07:10
the testimonies of what Jesus is doing you can know they're not ready they're not ready for their eyes to open up God
1:07:16
can't force their eyes to open up you can't force our eyes to open up so what God is calling you to do is to be gentle
1:07:23
be loving be Kind Show Them Love Don't Force don't push these things um but but
1:07:31
just show them love just show them love show them
1:07:37
kindness so um when that's happening don't get discouraged just know like
1:07:42
this is what it is their eyes are shut this is what it is there's not humility
1:07:48
there so that's their eyes aren't opening up but it's it's okay I'm not going to
1:07:55
like let this distract me or get me down I pray for them I love them I'm going to plant seeds and believe that the
1:08:01
kindness of God will lead to their repentance thank you Lord I speak right
1:08:07
now strength to all of you strength I see in the spiritual realm
1:08:14
God has raised you up to be Warriors in his end time Revival Army and he's opened up your spiritual eyes there's a
1:08:21
lot of blind people out there the Bible's coming alive like never before
1:08:26
there are Pharisees out there there are people with with specs and uh with
1:08:32
planks in their eyes who are trying to
1:08:37
um trying to mess with trying to take out the speck in your eye when many of
1:08:43
you don't even have a speck but they perceive you have a speck and
1:08:48
[Music] um they're they're are spiritually blind
1:08:56
people out there in this world there are people who are blind that the devil wants to use to try to
1:09:04
discourage the people of God but he is a loser the Devil is a loser and he will
1:09:11
never win so I declare this to you I declare strength to you strength that
1:09:16
you would be confident in who you are in Christ that you would be confident in
1:09:22
all that God has shown you that your eyes would remain wide
1:09:27
open that that no negative words from people no lies of the
1:09:33
devil would ever affect you would ever affect your strength your
1:09:40
joy and your calling for this great calling upon your life to be a powerful
1:09:47
vessel of God to be a warrior in his Revival Army nothing would hinder that
1:09:53
that nothing would affect that I speak strength to you
1:10:00
strength that you would every day not let the devil ever
1:10:09
win ever get you down ever steal your joy or your
1:10:14
peace but you would stay strong spiritually knowing who you are as a Victor a champion in Christ you have the
1:10:24
victory through Christ every single day you have the victory it doesn't matter what people say it doesn't matter what
1:10:31
the devil's trying to do you have the victory through Christ we have the
1:10:37
victory through Christ always every single day and we are going glory to glory we
1:10:44
are going higher and higher in this revival and we are on the Revival wave
1:10:50
Highway we are going fast with Jesus flying with Jesus into this new
1:10:58
level where we've never gone before where many more people will be reached
1:11:04
to find Jesus and Jesus in his fullness the Healer and the deliver of Jesus
1:11:11
Christ it is time now and nothing will slow you down nothing will slow us down
1:11:17
we are going glory to glory to glory so may you continue to fly with Jesus may
1:11:24
you may we may you all continue to Fly Fast together with Jesus never being
1:11:30
held back by any way any attack of the enemy in Jesus name I release this
1:11:37
anointing to you now and I speak the joy of the Lord to fill you peace to fill
1:11:44
you and such strength in the spirit strength in the spirit that you would
1:11:51
perceive things through the spirit that when you see you know that you would just see things
1:11:57
spiritually we can be always seeing things in the carnal carnal view or the
1:12:03
spiritual View and many times we see things first in the carnal view carnal
1:12:08
perspective and then we see it later in the spiritual perspective after we renew
1:12:14
our mind after we we we
1:12:21
remember but God wants to take you higher so you can not have to go through
1:12:29
that delay of seen first in the carnal perspective but you would see right away
1:12:35
in the spiritual perspective Joseph was was placed in the
1:12:42
prison but that was the Catalyst for him to be lifted into his
1:12:50
position his calling where God had called him to be at this High position
1:12:55
where the dream the promise would be fulfilled he was positioned in that prison to be lifted there so it was a
1:13:02
blessing for him to be put in the prison it was the final Catalyst for him to be
1:13:09
lifted and the promise fulfilled so when certain things happen
1:13:14
in our life we can choose to be spiritual right away we can choose to see I'm in a prison right now like
1:13:22
Joseph this is a catalyst I'm excited for what's coming oh I'm excited we can
1:13:29
choose to immediately be spiritual immediately instead of getting down of
1:13:36
what's by what's happening to us by the false accusations the unjust things happening to us we can
1:13:42
immediately be spiritual be excited be expectant of what's to
1:13:49
come amen amen may your eyes continue to
1:13:54
open stay open and may you be sharp in the spirit in Jesus
1:14:00
name amen
