our dog is slowly dying of old age and over the past week it has taken a toll emotionally and physically over my husband and I how do we keep the door
0:06
shut to the enemy during this sad time well first of all I want to say I'm
0:14
so sorry that you're going through that difficult time there's some things that are undeniably just difficult to go
0:19
through um for over people and pets that are are loved so I'm sorry to hear that
0:28
um but to to to to share with you um you know how to be strong through this and
0:35
how to not let sadness take
0:41
over is when it comes to first of all pets
0:46
like understanding their usual lifetime spans for one and just understanding
0:52
like this is part of life number one um and just like you
0:58
know renewing your mind that it will be okay and that God will be your strength
1:06
and um I like what I mean is since it's a natural um like a natural thing for
1:13
animals to not live that long just to know that um it's okay it's not
1:20
something like the devil's bringing or something to bring hard times to you type thing but it's just like a part of
1:27
life and that's okay and um also to see the bright side of it like see I mean
1:34
see like different seasons in life that we have and you know our heart can only
1:41
um give so much cuz we're not God like God somehow can love millions of people
1:50
as if they were the only person in the world at one time and um I know like for me um
2:00
like for me right now in the season of my life it I it it was a dream and still
2:06
a dream of mine to have children and I believe that's I believe that's a
2:11
promise from God but at the same time I've completely given it to God and um I
2:17
used to like really want to have children when I was like late 20s at like the
2:23
latest um but now I've really surrendered that to God that even if
2:28
I have children at an old age or something like um older than most people do or
2:35
something like I that's okay I've surrendered that to God CU I've I now really well number one I just love God
2:42
so I've surrendered everything to him but even in my heart I can accept it because I can really accept it and feel
2:50
okay with it and not feel grieved with a dream that I had um being like delayed
2:57
or you know um because I've really seen like God's hand
3:04
upon my life God's will like I'm not married and I don't have children and I
3:12
don't have pets and I used to have pets and um I I
3:18
and now like in this season I see like how I would spend a lot of time loving on the pets and that's like not a bad
3:26
thing at all but I just see like how now it's like we have a certain capacity and
3:32
so right now God wants me to give like all of the capacity of my heart to my
3:39
spiritual children like all of it whereas like when I if and when I have
3:46
physical children I I could you know there's going to be times where I I literally
3:53
have to be with the children like right now I'm able to do lives twice a week
3:58
and I'm just I'm able to work like so much of the time and so it's like in this season of my life God wants to do
4:06
more through me in this season and in other Seasons he can still move through
4:12
me but in another season it might not be as
4:17
much as right now like if I'm able to give 100% like of my time besides um
4:25
resting and and eating and and alone time with the Lord if I'm able to give 100% now there will come a time where if
4:32
I have children I I can give like 90% or 80% or 70% depending on the season right
4:39
so um that's like really helped me rest in God's will when it comes
4:46
to um that dream because I see the beauty in it I
4:53
see like how God wants to do this and God wants to touch many people and like
4:59
if I had other things going on if I had children right now I wouldn't God
5:04
couldn't use me as much he still use me greatly but um in this season especially
5:10
like in this pioneering Revival season in the season before others are raised
5:17
up in leadership to take over the important work of God when I need to be
5:23
out or something you know what I mean um I've seen the beauty in that and so now
5:29
it's like like I I'm really happy I don't have children right now which I can't believe I'm saying because that
5:34
was such a big dream um but just because I
5:39
understand specifically from my personal life I I see now like I see God's
5:44
perspective in in this situation like over the past three years I see and I'm like oh thank God that you didn't give
5:50
me my my dream um when I wanted it you
5:56
know thank God even though it was like beautiful and everything but God's timing is everything it can ruin
6:03
something it can ruin a good thing you know if it's outside of God's timing so
6:10
um I say all that to say is that I've really learned about like heart capacity
6:17
I've really learned at like wow like this is really God's perfect timing
6:25
that I don't have like all of these things that need my heart and love and
6:31
attention like in the home for what he wants me to to do for him and it's it is
6:37
a sacrifice it is a sacrifice because um to have that
6:43
personal daily um connection and um time
6:49
spent with a spouse uh children and for some people pets like that's like the
6:56
best thing right that's their favorite thing so it is a sacrifice but it's
7:02
worth it because God's will is perfect amen so um heart capacity that's
7:09
what I wanted to share so understanding like if there's going to be a new season
7:14
coming in your life where
7:19
um there there's more space like how I have more space you know that's not a bad thing that I mean
7:27
God may may be may be calling you to to give that capacity to to serving him
7:33
more for his people um that's the way to look at the
7:39
bright side of it amen and to see that it's like not all bad and it's not all
7:45
sad and it's not all devastating um but there are seasons of life
7:51
and sometimes it's hard to see that a next season or a season ahead though it
7:57
looks different could be wonderful sometimes we just want the season we're in right now how things are
8:05
our daytoday how things are the people in our life and the things we love in
8:11
our life but things change things shift and it's not a bad thing it's okay it's
8:17
it's good it's it's God has such great plans so rest knowing that that
8:23
though like you loved this season and all that it is and all that is the pet
8:29
pet daily in your life you know but God has such great plans ahead and such joy
8:35
ahead so you can look forward to that rather than
8:40
dreading um the time that that season shifts because of a loss that may be
8:47
there amen when 5f is operating with many apostles does that mean we will
8:52
have other coverings it's like Paul and Timothy and the rest of Paul's disciples
8:57
Paul would send Timothy y to share his words so in other words to share his
9:04
teachings and so um when other Apostles are raised up like in one Ministry they
9:10
aren't raised up to have a whole other Vision but it would be in line with the vision they they aren't raised up to
9:17
come up with some other random teachings
9:23
and Doctrine but it would be in line with the same vision so um it's very much biblically
9:31
like how it was with Paul and Timothy so Paul we read in the New Testament how he sends
9:36
Timothy um a trustworthy spiritual son to share with
9:43
a congregation his teachings um
9:49
so Timothy's Timothy those who those who Tim whom Timothy was ministering to and
9:56
teaching um they had the same spiritual father as Paul so um it's the same covering it
10:04
doesn't become something separate but we're all United and in One
10:10
Vision do we have to know the mysteries of the Bible in order to inherit the kingdom of God is the anointing based on
10:16
the knowledge of these Mysteries well when we say Mysteries of the Bible it's important to not think
10:21
it's something like mystical or obsolete or only for a few people
10:30
type thing I mean I think when you say m when one think's Mysteries they might see it as that as if it's hard to attain
10:37
um but I think when many people say Mysteries or when I say mysteries for example to me to me it means
10:44
Mysteries Revelation Secrets the deeper
10:50
things uh Jesus said to the disciples when they came back from first casting
10:57
out demons um he said well I gave you Authority and
11:02
that's how you were able to cast out these demons and then he prays to the
11:07
father and he says I praise you father that you have hidden these
11:13
things from those who are proud and you've only revealed it to the
11:18
humble and the childlike what are these things that he's talking about well the passion translation says
11:27
revelation of your author Authority the revelation of your
11:33
Authority so okay what does that mean that means revelation of how to walk in the
11:41
authority of Christ revelation of what Authority in Christ
11:47
means and that's one translation from as we read the word holy spirit gives us
11:54
more Revelation uh of what the scripture is saying so
12:00
even just the the M most translations say I praise you father for hiding these
12:08
things from those who are proud and only revealing it to those who are childlike and humble so he says this right after
12:17
the disciples went and first casted out demons so they went cast out demons for the first time when Jesus was the was
12:23
the only one doing that until now and then the disciples came to Jesus and said this this is what happened and then
12:30
Jesus immediately praises the father and says these things these things so we can gather
12:38
that he's talking about what the disciples had and what the disciples had was power
12:46
of God that Jesus released to them because they were trustworthy and also
12:54
Revelation Revelation going from the basic
13:00
just reading the word of God just like the Pharisees had the same word of God that they read but they were missing so
13:07
much revelation of who God was and God's kingdom and what the word of God was
13:14
saying really okay so the disciples that were
13:19
now casting out demons because of their humility they God could open their eyes
13:27
and they could receive Revel ation more understanding of the kingdom
13:33
of God the things of the kingdom of God their spiritual eyes were opened to
13:38
understand the things of the Kingdom more deeply and so if you read the Bible
13:47
without the Holy Spirit or you read the Bible with the holy spirit that comes upon salvation but still have pride in
13:54
your heart you are limiting yourself from
13:59
receiving from the word of God from hearing God speak in the word of
14:05
God but if you are humble now that's humility is the key
14:11
that opens your eyes is is what makes is what allows God to open your eyes and have Revelation and understand things in
14:20
the spiritual realm understand more of the complexities the spiritual principles
14:26
the spiritual laws and so this free gift that God has given us
14:34
of Abundant Life an inheritance of the kingdom of God God wants this for
14:42
everyone this is a free gift for everyone but you're going to limit yourself from what you're able to
14:48
receive if you have pride in your heart when you have humility like pure I'm
14:54
talking pure humility like when you were truly humble nothing nothing will stop
14:59
you from receiving the full inheritance of the kingdom of God but a big part of
15:06
receiving the inheritance the Abundant Life is having understanding of how to
15:12
receive these things having an and a big way of receiving these things is following God's word following his
15:18
principle not following like the Pharisees did religiously but having Holy Holy Spirit to help you understand
15:24
the principles you know and and and
15:31
so a big part of this understanding and Revelation a big part of how that comes
15:37
in one's life is by following the principle of being planted and being
15:43
equipped and receiving teaching that releases this
15:48
Revelation so like God hasn't made it difficult to find but sometimes out of
15:54
Pride people try to make it difficult to find like if you go against the princip full of being planted in a church that
16:03
is God's true church where God's power really is and where his leaders are true annointed Servants of God if you go
16:08
against that principle maybe like out of Pride you know um and you're like no I
16:13
don't need that like I have Holy Spirit and I can just um get all the Revelation
16:19
by myself you're making it hard for yourself because God doesn't go against his word so you'll limit yourself there
16:25
will be some things that you just won't discover that God just won't release
16:30
because he doesn't go against his principles and so there's many Revelations many Revelations of the word
16:38
of God having to do with his principles that are released through anointed teachers through your anointed leader
16:45
just simply released and so it's not difficult to receive but we just have to
16:50
be humble and go according to God's principles how do we know we are in the spiritual
16:56
[Music] realm I think you mean how do we know we are seen in the spiritual realm I think
17:05
that's what you mean um because when we belong to Jesus we're
17:10
always in the spiritual realm automatically and even the Bible says we are seated in Heavenly places right now
17:16
we are seated in Heavenly places with Jesus so whether we are constantly
17:22
realizing it or not we are always in the spiritual realm the spiritual realm is more real than the Physical Realm so
17:27
that Realm always exists I mean that's where God is and God lives inside of you
17:34
so um God's a spirit God's a spirit demons are in the spiritual realm and
17:40
then sometimes we see them manifest where in the physical you can see that's a demon although you have to be in the
17:48
spirit in your mind to discern like if you aren't if you aren't in the
17:53
spiritual realm in your mind and with your eyes demons can be speaking out of a
17:59
person something so Supernatural can take place of how the demon is manifesting in a person but if you're
18:05
completely carnal and not spiritual not being in the spirit you can call it acting you can call it um I don't know
18:14
whatever the whatever they want to think whatever they want to call it that's their explanation and they're like they
18:19
can't see at all the spiritual realm they cannot see at all spiritual realm but when you when your spiritual eyes
18:26
have opened up and you see demons manifested a person you see in the spiritual realm oh that's a demon you
18:32
see fully in the spiritual realm but um the question was how to be in the spiritual realm so I think you
18:39
mean how to make sure you're like seen in the spiritual realm and your mindset is in the spiritual
18:47
realm so um the biggest part of being like being
18:54
in the spiritual realm like seeing and thinking spiritually
18:59
is having to do with your faith and having to do with what you
19:06
choose [Music] to believe as truth
19:13
like as God opens up your eyes to his truth um let me give you an example so
19:19
as God opens up your eyes to the truth that the devil is real and we are in a spiritual
19:26
war and he comes in different ways he attacks in the mind he can try to influence our
19:33
thoughts our thoughts aren't always our original thoughts and they aren't always from God
19:39
our thoughts but sometimes they are a weapon coming from the enemy that he
19:45
wants to prosper in the form and by it prospering means when you hear that
19:52
thought you believe it's yourself or you believe it's God and therefore you
19:58
accept did is truth and let it stay and maybe continue to think about
20:04
it or maybe even speak it out that's the devil's aim that's his
20:12
attack that's how he wants the weapon to prosper but when your eyes have opened
20:18
up to the truth I was just sharing that the devil sometimes influences our
20:23
thoughts that our thoughts aren't always our thoughts or God God thoughts and you know your eyes have you your eyes have
20:29
opened up by Faith by believing in God's word about how the devil's a liar and
20:37
you know what God says about you and what he thinks about you and that he doesn't condemn there's no no longer there for
20:45
no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus so when a thought comes that's negative that's evil but
20:54
you don't want it there and you're like ew why did that thought just come in my
21:00
mind I don't like that now when you're
21:05
not spiritual when you're not going in the spiritual Realm by Renewing Your Mind of what God has already shown you
21:11
taught you in his word through teaching you will think it's yourself
21:20
and feel so bad oh my heart is bad oh I'm so ashamed I had that thought
21:29
wow I I'm so wicked in my heart oh God saw and he's ashamed of me I
21:36
disappointed God H and you just go on this spiral and then that can lead to who knows what where all of a sudden
21:42
like you're depressed and then you're starting to self-medicate yourself or something because you're it just was a
21:48
domino effect of you not being in the spirit of you not going in the spirit by
21:53
Renewing Your Mind with what you have learned so it's by faith and by Renewing
21:59
Your Mind remembering what God has shown you
22:05
the truth the real truth the real truth about the spiritual realm but if you go
22:12
in the spirit by Renewing Your Mind by faith that thought comes an evil thought
22:18
comes you have an evil thought you
22:23
will remember oh I've I've learned this I've learned
22:30
from God in his word through his and through his spoken word I've learned
22:35
that not all my thoughts are my thoughts sometimes the enemy sends a bad thought
22:43
but it's not mine and God's not mad at me for having the thought because I didn't have the thought it was the devil putting it
22:49
there and so I just need to reject it right now and that's how that thought can't become me a part of me a part of
22:56
my identity and a part of my heart so as you reject it your heart remains pure if
23:03
you accept it you've tainted your heart you know it's true now you it's become you when
23:10
you accept it I mean you can still repent and reject it but I'm saying like we can stay pure even if you're having
23:16
those like bad thoughts sometimes it doesn't mean oh you've gone backwards oh you aren't as pure as you thought no
23:23
reject it and that hasn't that's not a part of you it's not a part of you you won
23:28
that battle and you moveed forward you didn't go backwards you move
23:35
forward so um you reject the thought you you say I reject that thought and and
23:41
you declare the opposite you declare God's word you know if the the thought was
23:46
about yourself like a evil thought about yourself or maybe even like a suicidal thought or something like that you say I
23:53
want to live a long prosperous life fulfilling my calling of what God has
23:59
uh uh called me to speak that aloud if the negative thought was about somebody else jealous thought just evil thought
24:07
revengeful thought or something like that you reject it and you speak the opposite I bless this person and I pray
24:14
for them and I want the best for them and blessings upon their life and if the
24:21
person's um you know done bad things and is influenced by the enemy you can pray
24:26
I pray that their eyes open up I pray that they will come to Salvation and know God's
24:32
love and be who God called them to be and that's how you have Victory so that's going in the spirit that's going
24:39
in the spirit the main part of go being in the spiritual realm of living in the
24:45
spiritual realm the main way to do this is by Renewing Your
24:51
Mind with what you have learned so that means you have to learn you have to be a student you have to be a disciple of the
24:57
word of God of the word of God and the RMA spoken word of God like what you're doing today you are listening to the
25:03
spoken word of God receiving revelation of the word of
25:09
God so the more you the more you get the word of God in you in those two ways the
25:15
written word of God the Bible and the spoken word of God bringing Revelation and the the the present tense word that
25:21
God speaking um the more the
25:27
more the more it becomes you the word becomes you and so there's not really a
25:34
delay when a negative thought comes for example or a negative situation arises in life um um a battle
25:43
circumstance you you immediately remember what you've learned
25:48
you remember what what God shown you it it's inside of you you don't have to go digging you don't have to
25:54
like take a long time to even know the truth you're you're in the truth now you're living in the
26:00
truth you're living in the spiritual realm so you don't have to like go in
26:06
the carnal mess up and then like then go into the spirit no when you're feeding
26:13
yourself enough with the word of God and closing the door to to the enemy in all ways just feeding yourself with the word
26:20
of God written in the logos and the Rama the the spoken that's a big part of
26:27
being in the spiritual already and then you're able to act in the spiritual realm you're able to think and speak and act in the spiritual realm because the
26:34
word has become such a part of you you're you're already doing your part regularly to go in the spirit to be in
26:41
the spiritual realm when we mess up and sin but we repent and close doors does
26:46
anything happen to our Authority in the spiritual realm or the anointing we have
26:53
received it depends um it depends like God has so much grace
26:58
that it's not like you have to be completely perfect or you are immediately losing the anointing you
27:06
have received no we have God's grace we live in God's grace but at the same time this the the
27:15
the the anointing which is the power of God and a higher level of authority is not given to everyone but
27:23
it's given to those who can be trusted and those who can be trusted are those who are are completely surrendered to
27:29
God who are truly living in the spirit who are choosing to grow up and be
27:35
spiritually mature Warriors of God um you know it's like it's like if okay
27:42
let's pretend in the in the world let's pretend that like being in the military
27:48
was like the most important job type thing like that's how this is just me
27:53
making this up I'm not saying this but let's pretend being in the military was like the most important job and um
28:00
that's where I guess the most power and the most like the most effect you could have in the world was to be in those
28:07
positions And so there's some people that everyone's capable everyone's able
28:13
let's pretend that everyone's able physically right to do this in the world let's just pretend and mentally too and
28:21
um but they have a choice they have a choice to be a civilian or they have a choice to make a
28:27
great sacrifice and give their life for the service of
28:34
others and um go to boot camp and work
28:39
hard and not be lazy and
28:44
then power is given to them right um and then with the power given to them
28:50
they're able to do the greatest good in the world so it's like that in the spiritual
28:57
Realm it's like that in the spiritual realm we all have the choice to be in the army of God and when we're in the
29:05
army of God we will that's when God gives us the the the ammunition in the
29:12
spiritual realm the weapons in the spiritual realm that have great power we've been given Authority and we
29:19
truly have them in our hands and
29:24
um and this is where the the the greatest Works in this in the kingdom of
29:29
God will take place that's is where we can put the biggest Dent into the devil's Kingdom and and and and do the
29:36
biggest job in our lives like do like do the biggest greater great good that's
29:43
how is by being in the Revival Army by being entrusted with anointing and given a a higher level of authority because
29:50
we're all given Authority in the spiritual realm but we're first entrusted with authority over just our
29:55
own spiritual life so we can fight off the devil of our own spiritual life but
30:02
God wants us to graduate from there so then we can be given a a higher level
30:08
authority to it's like having um children when you have children now you have authority over them uh where you didn't it before you
30:15
just had authority over yourself so now God wants you to graduate so you can
30:20
execute your execute Authority in Christ over other people like you can command demons and other people they must leave
30:26
this person so you're able to use this Authority for good to destroy the works
30:31
of the devil in other people's lives not just your own
30:36
life so um you have to be entrusted to that so so anyways back to the question
30:44
um can you can you lose anointing when you when you sin so so God first pours
30:51
out the anointing when he can trust you so he's going to test you many times and
30:56
so when he sees you passing test after test after test at the same time there's also going to be transformation taking
31:02
place so at the same time in your heart it doesn't even be difficult to resist temptation
31:09
anymore because you've been transformed by God of course tests can get harder
31:14
but um you've truly been transformed so God knows he can trust you he knows this isn't like risky right he's really
31:22
tested you and also transformed you like you've gone through the boot camp training
31:28
so you're ready and you can be trusted with this so then he'll pour out the
31:35
anointing and so normally if a person stays surrendered after they've passed
31:40
those tests um usually a person wouldn't be messing up that much they might from
31:48
time to time a little bit but not that much and you know so as it's just a little bit little mistakes and we have
31:54
God's grace there's not going to be anointing that's that's lost but it can happen that a person is given
32:02
anointing and then they have in their own free will decide to not resist because they
32:10
have the power to resist with God's strength but maybe they're they're slacking in their surrender all of a
32:16
sudden and then one may sin and may sin
32:22
several times and so when you're sinning several times and not repenting when
32:27
there's been a a true change a true change like a
32:32
true change of surrender that's what it comes down to surrender there's been a true change of surrender that's when
32:38
it's different that's when God can see oh you're not trustworthy anymore for now not forever you can change but it's
32:45
up to you but for now kind of kind of like um boot camp you go through boot camp
32:53
you're now in the military but you start acting weird you're going to be I don't know all these official rules but I
32:59
assume um you know you you'll have to sit out you or maybe you'll be sent home
33:05
you know if you start acting up a lot of times and showing you're not trustworthy
33:12
you can't remain in that position so that's how it is with God so
33:17
if you are really showing all of a sudden there's this change where you're just not as trustworthy as you used to be when you receive that anointing then
33:24
God could take that anointing away some of the anointing away um but it's up to you to to repent
33:33
and surrender surrender everything and live in that surrender and then God can
33:38
continue to pour that anointing in your life so it's really having to do with
33:45
your heart your surrender it's not so much to do with um religious laws oh you didn't do that
33:55
law perfectly so that's it it's done we're we're under God's grace now
34:02
so it's it's about the heart it's about the surrender and so sometimes we make a mistake and we didn't do it in a
34:08
malicious way God sees that and God but God wants
34:13
to see the humility that even though we didn't do it in a malicious way we're truly sorry and we're truly repentant he
34:18
wants to see that he doesn't want to see us being all casual like oh I didn't know so we want
34:26
he wants us to see like oh Lord please help me next time um not mess up like I
34:31
don't want to even though I didn't do this in a bad heart but help me Lord help me Lord like hear your voice better
34:38
like anything keeping me from hearing your voice um any anything that's not
34:43
total humility like help me Lord help me see it because I don't want to make that mistake again even though I didn't do in
34:50
a malicious way but I I feel bad that I made that mistake you know God wants to see that humble heart that we we're
34:58
truly repentant truly humble and that we're not prideful to be like well God
35:03
you should have told me better or something you know I don't know any better you know he wants to see that
35:09
we're not that way but we're humble that's what he's looking at uh someone in her life is is telling her she feels
35:15
like God is calling her to be planted where God's power is where God
35:20
is moving I'm just making this a general question so everyone so everyone can receive from this who's watching um so
35:27
I'm like paraphrasing this question but she feels like God's calling her to be planted at a church where God's power is
35:34
moving um where she will be equipped as the anointing through anointed teaching
35:42
um but at the same time she loves her local church is it my place to give like a confirmation so I don't know what her
35:49
local church is but I'm assuming just I'm just going to say
35:54
this for the sake of a general question to help a lot of people at the same time I'm assuming the local church just based
36:00
on how the anointing is rare today I'm assuming maybe the local church isn't operating in the power of God let's say
36:06
that's the case so you know this is a basic principle basic basic principle that when your
36:13
eyes are open it's like just be at a church where God's power is moving so
36:18
that the anointing is there to destroy yoges and the anointing is there to release covering over you and you're
36:24
receiving anointed and prophetic teachings that are really equipping you to be a powerful vessel of God Victorious over the enemy in your own
36:29
personal life and Victorious over others like be being able to be a powerful vessel of God to help other people so um
36:38
that's like a no-brainer for those whose eyes are opened up like the difference between a church where God's power isn't
36:45
and there isn't that anointing to bring that important equipping and protection and uh Deliverance if needed and healing
36:54
um that's a no-brainer but to some people it's not is such a no-brainer um
36:59
and so it's important that we don't like force Revelation upon
37:04
someone the Revelation that people receive it's important that it comes in God's timing so that they can really
37:11
receive it so that they aren't feeling like pressured um and just God's timing is
37:17
best God's timing is best so like for for you it may be obvious like no like
37:23
you this is what you need to do but um just be gentle and follow the
37:29
holy spirit's leading and just share your own personal testimonies like your own personal testimony like if that
37:37
person is saying that they feel God's calling them to be planted in a church where God's power is but yet they like
37:42
their the church they're currently at you know like that kind of thing you can discern especially if they're saying it
37:48
like that that this is God's will since they're saying God's calling them here but they like this CU many times God's
37:53
calling us to be here but we like over here you know we don't always just
37:59
because God's will is here doesn't mean we dislike where we're at oftentimes God's will is uncomfortable and it's
38:07
oftentimes it means we have to sacrifice and say goodbye to the other season and the things we liked in the other season
38:12
right so anyways um I would say just just share your own testimony like just
38:19
share your own testimony about how you saw a difference in your life um organically like don't force that upon
38:26
the person but if the person is opening up and really wants advice like if they're like I am so struggling with
38:32
this decision I just can't get this out of my heart that I'm supposed to be
38:37
planted in a church where God's power is but I'm so conflicted do you have any
38:43
advice like if they come openly like that then that's a time that you can
38:50
share your testimony and depending on how Holy Spirit leads if they're like I just don't know what to do like
38:57
you can share you know for me it was definitely this decision so I I
39:04
absolutely recommend being planted where in a church where the power of God is but at the same time don't
39:11
like um impose yourself as their like
39:17
spiritual leader that's why I say just be gentle like just share your testimony and as the Holy Spirit leads how do we
39:24
know if we have all of the old wine skin out of us so for those of you that don't know what
39:30
old wine skin means there's a scripture a powerful scripture where
39:35
uh the the um the Pharisees were saying
39:41
to um Jesus well there's there's also a
39:46
scripture there's like two it's in the it's in the gospel different times but there's one time when actually John the
39:52
Baptist um disciples were actually saying to Jesus how come your disciples
39:58
aren't fasting like we were taught by John the Baptist now
40:05
John prepared the way for Jesus was his cousin and was a true prophet of God but
40:12
it was Jesus's assignment to bring the new wine and so even though John did what God wanted him to
40:19
do he still like had some old the old wine ways because it was Jesus Jesus who
40:27
was going to bring the new wine Jesus I mean Jesus did something so different than all the old the prophets before him
40:34
the teaching he brought the Revelation he brought the doctrine about God and his kingdom that he brought was
40:40
different it was new wine so um there was that confusion
40:47
because John the Baptist taught them to fast a certain way and it would have been in more of like a religious
40:53
way where Jesus's way of fasting he taught his disciples would have been by
40:59
the leading of the Holy Spirit and not to do it just like too traditionally and just doing it to do it but really being
41:06
led by the spirit when you fast which in in that case in that season was not fasting like at all in that time because
41:15
when Jesus was there with the disciples it was really time to teach them and for them to go out and do the works and it
41:21
just wasn't a season of fasting for that time that small time that he is with the
41:29
disciples cuz he says there will be a time later when I when I go and like
41:34
this is going to be necessary for your your spirit to be strengthened but like
41:40
as they were as in that season they were doing the work of God and God it wasn't
41:45
the season for that so um then Jesus then goes on to say right after this
41:53
question this is how he chooses to answer the question like why don't you why don't you and your disciples fast
41:58
like how we fast his qu his answer is this he gives
42:05
a parable of old wine versus new wine and he
42:12
says with new wine you cannot put it in old wine skin or else the old wine skin
42:17
will tear it will break and all the all the wine will spill because the the new wine really
42:26
expands so much the the car it expands and so the uh
42:33
wine the skin has to be new and flexible and be able to expand with it or it will
42:38
burst so he gives that example and so the reason he's giving
42:44
this example is he's basically saying you have an old wine skin kind of
42:50
Doctrine and I am coming with new wine and so you have to shed your old wine
42:55
skin meaning humble yourself be ready for the new stop seeing the new as
43:01
something wrong and outside of the word word of God um stop seeing it like in a skeptical
43:09
way you need to humble yourself and get ready for the new so you can receive the
43:15
new that's the action of shedding your old wine skin is to humble yourself and get ready for the new and that's what
43:21
that's one of the biggest things that God is calling us to do today in the body of Christ
43:27
like we need to look at the book of Acts we need to look at the gospels of Jesus the ministry of Jesus and we need to
43:33
look at the book of Acts and look at the ACT church and look how the ministry of
43:39
Jesus was and how the church was in the book of Acts and we need to be real with
43:44
ourselves humble ourselves be real with ourselves and see that church today does not look like it did in the book of Acts
43:51
and in the ministry of Jesus in the gospels the church today is missing the
43:57
power of God that makes demons tremble in the middle of the synagogue like it did in the time of Jesus or in the
44:02
middle of the Church of today the Church of today is missing a big part of the Great Commission the
44:09
command that God told us to he taught us how to do ministry he said preach saying that the Kingdom of Heaven has come near
44:15
cast out demons lay hands on the sick and they will be healed we are missing a
44:21
great portion of what God has called us to do of how he's called us to minister we are missing what we see in
44:29
the acts Church what we see in the New Testament of how God
44:34
releases teaching equipping and impartation to the Believers which is the five-fold ministry we're missing the
44:42
apostles and the prophets which according to Ephesians 2:20 they are the foundation of the church with Christ
44:47
Jesus as the Chief Cornerstone there is so there is
44:52
foundational parts of of Church of the ministry of Jesus that we we are missing
44:57
today that is a serious deal that is a red flag that is an emergency time but
45:03
we've just gotten complacent and turned to Blind Eye but when you can be humble and read the word of God it's grieving
45:09
it's shocking it's humbling we are missing so much and actually the foundational part of what Jesus has
45:15
commanded us to do and the example he showed us in the book of
45:21
Acts so all that being said if people would just humble themselves and be real
45:26
with themselves they would realize I'm missing so much the church I'm going to is missing so much the
45:33
minister at my church is missing a lot of Revelation it it's just the way it is I
45:38
mean it's not we're not seeing what we see in the book of Acts so that therefore means we are missing something
45:45
we are missing by and large the Revelation by and large we're missing
45:50
the things that Jesus talks about he released the things the
45:55
Revelation and the anointing to the disciples and that's how they were able to do what he told them to do cast out
46:02
demons have the power of God so we're missing a lot of things we missing a lot
46:07
of Revelation in the church today and that equals new
46:13
wine that equals it's like we have gone backwards like Jesus came like the
46:18
apostles went forward in the acts church we went backwards we went backwards where we
46:25
need Jesus again but today he's moving through vessels to command the same thing he was commanding back in the
46:32
gospels and demonstrating back in the gospels this is my kingdom it's not a
46:37
matter of talk but of power God has anointed me to preach the
46:44
good news to the poor to Proclaim that freedom is here for the
46:50
captives heal the sick cast out demons this is what I did in my Ministry now
46:55
you do it so we need we need Jesus
47:00
again and he's coming again he has come again through his vessels today to Proclaim this
47:06
word you know we we it's like we've gone backwards where we're like the Disciples
47:12
of John the Baptist why aren't you fasting like we're fasting those questions are asked today to people in
47:19
the new wine why aren't you doing communion the way we do communion why aren't you praying for
47:25
people the way we pray why don't your prayer why don't you have prayer teams and these things the way we
47:31
do why don't you do offering the way we do why don't you preach the way we do
47:37
why don't you have a man leading the church like we do why don't you use just pastors like
47:43
we do why do you use Apostles and prophets in the church why don't you cast out demons
47:50
like we do it's the same thing it's the same thing as we see the the disciple IES of
47:57
John the Baptist asking Jesus why aren't you guys fasting like we
48:04
are so that's old wine because Jesus immediately says you guys have old wine skin you have old wine you need to get
48:09
rid of that so you can receive the new wine so all those like skeptical like
48:18
questioning resistant to receive the new wine which is simply what Jesus released
48:26
in the gospels and through the apostles it's not some mystical out there new
48:33
thing that's outside of the word of God no it's what was missing but that is the new today it's
48:39
Revival Reviving what was lost bringing the new to the old where they've lost
48:46
the the new we are H now seems new because it's been completely
48:53
lost so today when one does not show shed their
48:59
old wines skin by having humility and by being real with themselves that we are
49:06
they themselves are missing things Revelations and maybe the church they're
49:11
in is missing things or the leader they have the missing things like you have to have that that be real with yourself and
49:20
humble yourself and be expectant for the new and be ready and humble like a child
49:26
to receive the new instead of resisting it with offense and pride and trying to
49:32
compare it to your old
49:37
wine so the question was how do we know if we have rid ourselves of all the old
49:44
wine cuz for sure we all have old wine unless you were never a Christian in
49:50
your whole life and didn't know anything about Jesus and you came to the Lord in the new wine you came to the
49:58
Lord in a church where the it's nothing but the new wine those are the only
50:04
people that are not going to have to shed old wine and that's going to be rare that's going to be rare so
50:12
um how you can know if you've rid yourself from the old wine well a big
50:18
indicator is that you aren't being like John the Baptist's um disciples you
50:25
aren't being like questioning cuz they were being questioning they were being skeptical and questioning like okay you
50:33
know we know John the Baptist is from God he's your cousin he baptized
50:41
you like you acknowledge he's she truly is a prophet and he taught us to fast like
50:49
this so what are you doing this isn't adding up and like because John the
50:54
Baptist was their leader like they had history with John the Baptist you know
51:00
they were like on more John the Baptist's side like rather than being
51:05
humble and realizing oh Jesus might be coming in an even greater way and
51:12
releasing new things that John the Baptist didn't have to give to us right
51:18
so um we shouldn't be like John the Baptist's disciples and be like
51:23
questioning and skeptical and comparing but we should be ready for the new so
51:28
rather if you were John the Baptist disciples in those times it would be better to like come with a humble heart
51:34
and say Jesus Jesus says to not fast right now
51:40
so okay I received that and maybe ask in a humble way like
51:46
Lord I see that this is the right way can I want to understand why this is the
51:51
right way you know what I mean like coming more like Desiring understanding but already already receiving the truth
51:58
before having the full understanding you know because many times God calls us to
52:04
receive just receive his truth receive his word before we have all of the
52:10
understanding many times that will come later as God reveals but that's many times a testing of our surrender and our
52:19
humility is if our mind can get out of the way we we we can just trust and
52:25
receive like a child so when you're hearing new wine
52:35
teaching Doctrine the new wine ways what is your heart doing that's how you can
52:41
know if you've shed your old wine skin if you are being
52:48
childlike and this is maybe brand new like you've never heard
52:53
before here's just an example like God's calling us to cast out demons now
53:00
like how Peter did I mean just walking in his
53:07
authority with the shadow touching people just people are being healed and
53:13
delivered it doesn't say that everyone needed oneon-one prayer it doesn't say that he was having to put fysical
53:21
effort it was just him walking in his authority speaking
53:27
and just the anointing was so mighty that they just came positioning themselves where it was being released
53:33
and the spiritual principle of authority is these people that have positioned themselves where the authority of Christ
53:39
is being executed through Peter they have to obey so the demons were just having to obey
53:45
because the vessels they lived in the people says I'm going the Jesus way I'm going and position myself where God's
53:52
power is going to be released and the authority of Christ is going to have to command you to get out of of my
53:57
body you know and so when they do that the demons are forced to
54:04
obey so but but like that way of casting out demons is honestly really rare
54:12
today and every time we see we don't see like in one time Paul and Peter and all
54:20
and all of the Apostles disciples like all casting out demons in one place together
54:27
we don't see that example we we see different times of ministry we see
54:35
like Peter was in the place of ministering and that's like he he was in
54:41
the position of um the minister to minister that day and
54:47
so all the demons had to go as he ministered Paul with the handkerchiefs and the aprons he was in the position to
54:53
minister that day where he was and so they were bringing the handkerchiefs and aprons to his skin and putting it on the
54:59
sick and Demon oppressed and the the demons and the sick were leaving him you
55:05
know it doesn't say that Peter and all the disciples walked together in a line and um their Shadows cast out the demons
55:14
because that's not how Authority works you know that's not how Authority
55:20
works just like the president he's in his office of President he issues a
55:25
command and then all all the citizens have to obey that command um he doesn't
55:31
have to assign a million people to declare the
55:36
same exact thing that he just declared for them the citizens to listen to it you know same for a teacher in a
55:42
classroom one teacher over 15 kids and she says everyone do this and everyone
55:48
has to do that she doesn't have she or he doesn't have 15 teachers all come and
55:57
be the teacher over each person um that's I'm just sharing what how
56:02
Authority Works in general like the principle of authority and it's by Authority that
56:08
demons go and so when we go outside the the laws of authority the principle of
56:14
authority demons mess around and demons don't go as as quickly and as as we're
56:21
just they find loopholes when we operate outside of the laws of the spiritual
56:27
realm they find loopholes that a kingdom and a kingdom divided against itself
56:33
cannot stand so like the more we are united together with God's ways and
56:39
God's kingdom and his principles the more the demons the more we're United the more the demons have to
56:46
obey but if we're divided like there's some people that are going according to God's true principle of authority and
56:53
then there's others that are there in the church doing the old win skin thing
56:59
that's not really going by the principle of authority um we're divided and so we
57:07
don't become as powerful and strong against the demons so that's why at fivefold
57:14
church it it's it's the way God leads us to do ministry leads me to minister and
57:20
cast out demons is the Apostle Peter example is it's
57:27
biblical you know as I shared we don't see several um even Jesus he he never
57:35
said like okay guys help me cast out this demon together you know we never
57:40
see that we never see you know we see the disciples sent out two by two but it wasn't the the the two people casting
57:48
the demons out of the one person at the same time type thing but they were it was more like
57:55
um one person would be would have been ministering at one time and another person assisting and
58:01
helping and serving so anyways um that's what I mean
58:08
by like new wine new doctrine that's being released today that's not new out
58:14
of nowhere it's biblical it's what's been lost but it's new for people from what they're used to today so when you
58:22
hear that new new wine how what is your heart doing is it receiving it like a
58:30
child or is it is it offended is it like
58:37
questioning you know or is it sometimes we like the old ways sometimes we prefer
58:43
the old ways yeah absolutely sometimes the old ways are more fun and more
58:48
comfortable so you know is the heart annoyed because
58:54
you like the old ways better and that's what you're used to and that's what you were trained
59:01
in and maybe that's what makes you feel more spiritually important or
59:08
something so that's how you can know now if your heart is responding
59:15
that kind of way remember that our thoughts aren't our own um so you can reject that it doesn't
59:22
mean that you're oh my gosh like I just had that thought and so I have a long
59:27
ways to go you can reject that but you but but so that doesn't mean it's
59:34
you but realize the scheme of the devil realize that they're like by
59:42
attacks that come to you you can know a particular attack of the devil like you're being hunted in this area I don't
59:50
mean that in a scary way but know that he's really trying
59:56
trying in this area so you have to be extra on guard you have to be extra humble you have to be very careful to
1:00:02
not slip up and be prideful to not slip up and um act on the thought or or that
1:00:11
the devil sent you you have to be extra sharp in that area you have to be extra
1:00:20
intentional and and and also when it comes to this area if the devil is attacking so much in that area like if
1:00:27
you like let's say that you really want to receive the new wine and you really
1:00:34
like your eyes have really opened up right so you really believe the new
1:00:40
wine but um at the same time like every time you hear teaching new wine teaching
1:00:47
new ways it's like you're feeling that way
1:00:53
you're feeling that kind of way you're feeling like offended you know understand that that is probably an
1:00:59
indicator that's usually an indicator that you have had a lot of old wine in the past maybe you've been doing a great
1:01:05
job of humbling yourself and shedding your old wine skin but there's been a lot of old wine that's accumulated so
1:01:12
that that can be an indicator that you still have some ways to go but you're
1:01:18
making progress and you just need to be uh a humble and alert in this area I
1:01:24
think I've answered this question before a couple times um but I will just share
1:01:29
it just in the past usually the spiritual q&as so
1:01:35
um it's it's it when you when your eyes you have to understand that so many eyes
1:01:41
aren't going to open up at the same speed Jesus um all of the people that
1:01:48
were really supposed to be the first people to accept him because they were worshiping the same
1:01:54
God the es the sagues very few accepted
1:02:01
him very few eyes opened up so um a very few's eyes opened up to
1:02:09
the truth so it's the same thing
1:02:16
today now we don't see we see Jesus going with
1:02:23
those who would go with him we don't see Jesus trying to pull
1:02:29
along those who disagreed with him in like trying to force like they
1:02:36
would have been hel holding him back he said to the disciples if people
1:02:42
don't receive you dust off your feet and leave and go I
1:02:48
mean it delays the work of God if we are trying to pull people that don't want to
1:02:54
be pulled that we are trying to open up eyes to people whose eyes they don't want to open up who they themselves in
1:03:00
their own free will they don't want their eyes open up it it holds us
1:03:08
back so um and and and it can be very dangerous if um I mean when you're
1:03:15
hearing the truth hearing the truth hearing the truth and you're closing the door to not
1:03:21
to to to to to the lies that's how you're able to stay focused and that's how you're able to be full of the spirit
1:03:29
and full of the truth and confident in the truth and do what God's called you to do serve him speak the word you are
1:03:37
full of his spirit and overflowing with the truth and the spirit and the love and joy and peace of God but when we
1:03:45
open up the door to negative voices to the voices opposite of the
1:03:52
truth we're not going to be full of the truth not going to be full of the spirit and we're not going to be able to be the
1:03:59
best vessels we can of God and we will be distracted so it can be very
1:04:08
dangerous and um you know I shared on this Sunday like we got to take this very seriously
1:04:16
like how dangerous it is to be listening to the wrong voices we got to take it very seriously
1:04:23
like the devil brought a third of the angels with
1:04:29
him that's how easily we can be deceived if we don't take this seriously not that
1:04:34
we have to be afraid but we need to have the fear of God when it comes to
1:04:42
deceit is I mean I just think it's mind-blowing that the devil could be that cunning you know and people
1:04:50
could believe those lies and um
1:04:56
same with the many disciples that left Jesus after he preached about Eat My Flesh and drink my blood most of the
1:05:03
disciples left him so they believed the LIE of the devil and they they left so it's it's dangerous to to listen to lies
1:05:13
it's very dangerous so have the fear of God have
1:05:18
the fear of God to to protect yourself because the devil is
1:05:24
cunning is cunning very cunning that's why we have to take this
1:05:29
seriously and have the fear of God when you have received the truth protect it for dear life it is the
1:05:36
kingdom of God is like a precious Pearl worth selling everything for that one Pearl so it's
1:05:44
worth giving up everything to protect this precious Pearl the kingdom of God
1:05:51
the truth you have received you have to protect the truth truth you have received you have to be aware the devil
1:05:59
hates me having this truth and living in this truth he wants to steal this he wants to lie to me and tell me it's not
1:06:05
the truth and draw me away from this precious Pearl the last question had to
1:06:10
do with like when people do are not in agreement with the new wine you have received or uh where you are
1:06:18
planted um the question was like how close do you keep that
1:06:23
person in your life anymore type thing so you have to really realize by the way
1:06:31
that like most of the people that were supposed to receive Jesus so when God
1:06:38
brings Revival and the new wine the people that are supposed to
1:06:44
receive him in his move in his Revival and his new wine that's been lost are
1:06:49
supposed to be the ones first up to the plate are supposed to be the biggest um current leaders in the Bible Body of
1:06:55
Christ and the ones next in line are supposed to be all
1:07:03
believers and many times you find that that's not the
1:07:09
case many times you find that like people want things as they are and then when something new comes along they
1:07:16
don't like it it makes them uncomfortable all sorts of things um and
1:07:21
then just a lot of old wine so without humility you don't don't have eyes to see what's truly of God and the new
1:07:28
thing that God's doing so it's it's nothing new nothing new Under the Sun as
1:07:34
the Bible says in the times of Jesus the people that were supposed to be first in
1:07:39
line to receive him were the religious leaders and
1:07:45
secondly all believers all of the Jewish people people of
1:07:52
God but I mean we only find like
1:07:57
Nicodemus partly received but not all the way and then he didn't really believe
1:08:03
until um after Jesus was was crucified
1:08:11
so that's sobering that's eye opening That's How we'll find it to be
1:08:19
today that it ends up being a rare thing more rare like in the beginning in the
1:08:26
beginning when God first bring the new wine first brings the new wine very few eyes can
1:08:32
see just like in the times of Jesus and it's the unlikely people it's the the
1:08:39
fishermen people that have humility the fishermen
1:08:45
the just the Average Joe's were the ones to receive Jesus the ones you wouldn't
1:08:52
guess would be first in line to receive the the Revival through Jesus receive
1:08:59
Jesus you would never guess that so
1:09:05
um those whose eyes are open you're like the disciples the first Disciples of
1:09:10
Jesus but you have to realize that in the beginning at least it's rare even when Jesus preached to thousands that
1:09:17
believed in him most left him when he was preaching about eat my flesh drink my
1:09:22
blood so it was a minority that could receive this difficult new
1:09:29
wine this difficult teaching that was
1:09:35
offending it was the minority and that's what I found that's
1:09:41
what I found like in my own Ministry um you know it was about 20 people were
1:09:49
were there the first year in the church and then 15 people and then 10 people and then five people and then two people
1:09:55
two of us John tall and I and um it was
1:10:00
really the Bible come alive it was yes God using it to refine me
1:10:07
but the root of it was not wanting to receive the new thing
1:10:12
that God was doing so for 4 and a half
1:10:20
years it was very few very few the my
1:10:26
minority that received like in my Ministry the new thing that God was
1:10:32
doing minority very
1:10:37
few so it's going to look like that in your own personal life you know that's
1:10:42
why you probably find you're one of the few in your family or a group of friends if not the
1:10:50
only one who receives a new thing that God's doing it's proportionate it's the
1:10:56
Bible come alive you know
1:11:01
um so it's like it's it's and and i' I've
1:11:06
seen this so much like this revival Army that God's Building it's like I see this like Precious Heart in France and this
1:11:14
Precious Heart in in um precious hearts in Philippines and
1:11:20
this Precious Heart in South Africa and this Precious Heart in Sweden and this
1:11:25
Precious Heart in Germany and this Precious Heart here and this Precious Heart there
1:11:31
and but it's like the M like God's Building a whole big
1:11:37
army but it's not the majority it's not the majority it's it's
1:11:45
like the precious diamond in the rough type thing
1:11:50
like it's just it's the Bible come alive
1:11:58
so um that's how it is so you you have to keep that in mind you have to know like stop being so shocked about it you
1:12:05
know what I mean like when you feel like the minority and so that's why it's
1:12:14
so important to hold on to this precious thing like come and be with the Disciples of Jesus don't go and have
1:12:20
coffee and chill with the Pharisees like come where you will be safe and where
1:12:26
you will grow and where you will fulfill your purpose and where you will be Iron sharpening iron it's not doing you any
1:12:32
good um chilling with the majority chilling with the Pharisees
1:12:39
amen be with your people be with your family it's a narrow road exactly yes
1:12:48
it's a narrow road the Bible says that it's a narrow road and that's what I'm talking about we got to stop being so
1:12:54
surprised we forget about that scripture when we lived in the old wine because it didn't feel like the narrow road in fact um
1:13:02
like in America I think majority call themselves Christians narrow road that doesn't make
1:13:07
sense well how many Christians are actually receiving Jesus in his fullness
1:13:12
not the parts that they're comfortable with now you see that it is a narrow
1:13:18
road what teachings do you recommend the most that really help us know about the old wine and new wine uh I I did a
1:13:27
series um months ago I think it was like last summer into the
1:13:34
fall I I spoke a lot about the old wine versus
1:13:40
new wine and I did a whole series on religion on the religious spirit and the
1:13:46
religious spirit is old wine it's another way to say religious spirit is is it's old wine old wine
1:13:53
Doctrine so um you can go back to those teachings I
1:13:58
have all my Ser all the messages all the sermons on a playlist all the Sunday messages at 5f on a playlist on my
1:14:05
YouTube so um you can go back they should be in order I think um but you
1:14:11
can go back and find those I think it was like summer to fall there was several weeks I feel like it was like
1:14:17
six weeks or so speaking about the new wine versus old wine and what religion
1:14:24
is what the religious is and how to be free of it how to
1:14:30
discern it I'm just going to make this a general question to answer I'm going to change the question around to be a
1:14:35
general one so it can be for everyone who listens to this um if so like we
1:14:41
have now a a a a woman who is called to be planted at a church where God's power
1:14:48
is moving new wine and we have a husband whose eyes isn't open up to the the new
1:14:55
wine and so um actually doesn't like uh that church she's planted at right so
1:15:02
she's asking should I not mention the name of my church and everything about it in my home if it
1:15:08
upsets my husband or should I be free to so just walk with the wisdom of the holy
1:15:15
spirit so there's you know if when you know God is calling you be planted at a certain
1:15:21
church but there's not like equally yolked happening right now in the in the marriage in that area um that's a great
1:15:29
favor and grace of God that you're able to still go to um that
1:15:37
church so that's a great favor and grace of God and if you know that your husband
1:15:45
isn't really isn't open at this point of time
1:15:50
to receive hear about it you know just as against it then the proper wisdom
1:15:57
would be to just keep it to yourself not talk about it to not um like there's a
1:16:05
great favor and Grace over you right now that there's not being this like forbidding you to go to a church where God's calling you to right that so let's
1:16:12
not you don't want to like shake that or hurt that um and so we all have free
1:16:17
will and so whenever even if it's someone close to you in your life like even a spouse you know they're not open
1:16:24
to hearing about Jesus like what Jesus has shown
1:16:30
you Revelations about Jesus or you know if they're not open if they don't want
1:16:35
to hear it we should not force it on them and that could cause problem to us just because it's going against the
1:16:42
principles of free will because there's principles in the spiritual realm so when we go against that principle it
1:16:48
could cause problems to us so if someone's being like hateful towards the
1:16:54
thing of God that a true thing of God a True Church of God that God's called you
1:16:59
to be planted to um Don't Rock the Boat you know un necessarily uh uh value that favor that
1:17:07
God's given by walking in that wisdom and respecting the Free Will and just keeping to yourself about it until the
1:17:15
person's ready until the person starts opening up um through the kindness of God leading to repentance so rather just
1:17:22
show love just show love so much the love of God and don't push it or be um
1:17:29
you know emotional or angry at them for example for um being against um what God's called you to like
1:17:37
don't bring it up don't push it just focus on loving them with the unconditional forgiving
1:17:44
graceful love of Jesus is there a teaching dedicated to the spiritual
1:17:50
realm well I would say every teaching seriously every teaching I am
1:17:56
really teaching the spiritual things so the spiritual realm is simply the spiritual things the things of the
1:18:02
spirit um to be alert in the spiritual realm
1:18:09
is is so much having to do with your mind being upon the things of God and
1:18:16
the word of God in the truth and the Revelation from his word and so that's what I'm bringing in every message so I
1:18:23
would um I would encourage you to be excited that with every teaching you're
1:18:29
entering in the spiritual realm well you're already there probably but you're entering deeper you're entering deeper I
1:18:34
mean when whatever we have a live it's we've gone into the spiritual realm and I don't know if you if you feel this but
1:18:40
I feel this right now where even it's spent almost two hours and it's so crazy
1:18:45
my physical body here on this Earth feels like it's been um half an hour
1:18:52
particularly even today and you know stuff like that happens when you're so in the spiritual realm where you're so
1:18:59
in the spiritual realm that you're you're like less in the
1:19:04
Physical Realm like you're you're so in tune in the spiritual realm that you
1:19:10
notice this shift that you've gone to another place or rather we've gone deeper into another
1:19:18
place we've gone deeper into the spiritual realm Less in the Physical Realm more into the spiritual realm cuz
1:19:24
we're always in both we're always in both but we want to be more into the spiritual realm than the physical at all
1:19:31
times amen we are in this world but not of this world so we are always in this
1:19:37
world we we we have a physical body so we we will be in this world in the Physical Realm but God calls us to be
1:19:45
more in the spiritual realm as we are still in the Physical Realm that's how
1:19:51
we become Spiritual Beings that's how we become super natural that's how we are able to access the heaven realm that's
1:19:58
how we are able to bring the kingdom of God here on Earth as God moves through us that's how we are able to walk by
1:20:06
faith and see God do powerful things in our life because we are deep in the spiritual realm we are deep in faith we
1:20:13
are deep into the real truth the spiritual truth is greater than the physical
1:20:19
truth so we can access the things of God the things from Heaven the the the
1:20:25
supernatural blessings from Heaven our inheritance amen thank you Jesus well I
1:20:31
want to declare over all of you right now thank you Jesus God we thank you so
1:20:37
much for what you've done today we thank you Lord for your presence and I thank you Lord for how you have lifted weights
1:20:43
off of people how you have brought peace and assurance and clarity thank you Jesus for all the ways you've moved
1:20:49
powerfully today thank you Jesus and I speak right now
1:20:57
that all of the areas that were holding you back bringing you holding you back
1:21:04
from being fully in the spiritual realm that they would be broken off and I declare any kind of old wine
1:21:13
lies angel of Light things that have seeped in through people through things
1:21:19
you've seen or heard may they be exposed to you right now
1:21:25
that that you wouldn't forget the truth because that's what the lies do
1:21:30
the lies try to get you to forget the truth and how much you knew it was truly
1:21:38
true just like how um when you let's say
1:21:44
um someone that you are close to as a in a relationship you you you are confident
1:21:50
in their love for you but let's say that they went away
1:21:56
for two weeks or maybe they were sick and not feeling well and you
1:22:03
weren't able to talk to them at all or they were just in a place where you couldn't communicate with them all for a couple weeks or even a month maybe and
1:22:11
then the devil could start speaking lies like why aren't they talking to you
1:22:16
maybe maybe they weren't who you thought they were and other people can start giving you reasons of why they aren't
1:22:22
talking to you um and this whole narrative comes in your head and you
1:22:28
believe it because you forgotten the truth you forgotten that that that
1:22:34
person you were close with never showed any red flags they never shown any signs that their character could be this
1:22:41
way that they weren't who you thought they were they never showed any signs of that but like this really happens like
1:22:49
people could have narratives in their head from the enemy or other people trying to come up with reasons conspir
1:22:54
iry conspiracy theories the devil likes to bring conspiracy theories when there's unknown or when I mean when when
1:23:01
when when you've chosen you've maybe chosen to forget the
1:23:06
truth you've chosen to not remember then it becomes like an open
1:23:12
space for conspiracy theory to come so I I declare right now that any ways the
1:23:18
devil has tried to bring conspiracy theories about the truth whether it was
1:23:24
just the things of the kingdom of God that God's revealed to you the new
1:23:30
wine um whom he's called you to be planted under the church who's been called you to be planted in what
1:23:36
whatever it whatever it was that you knew to be truth and God speaking a
1:23:42
really true any way that the devil tried to bring a conspiracy theory the devil tried to bring a lie in your head or
1:23:47
through other people I declare all of that poison from the enemy to be removed
1:23:54
and I declare all of the forgetfulness to be undone that you would
1:24:01
remember what God spoke to you and remember the truth as you knew it that
1:24:07
you would know it again to be truth that nothing would take that precious Pearl
1:24:14
from you I speak protection over that and I speak this anointing to come upon
1:24:21
you and wisdom to arise in you wisdom of how to make daily choices to protect
1:24:26
what you have received to protect the Pearl that you've received and to close the doors that need to be shut and to
1:24:34
really walk in the spirit in jesus' name I speak peace and joy and strength
1:24:42
to arise in you and I declare Miracles that come upon your life for all the needs that you
1:24:48
have physical to spiritual receive them in Jesus name amen
