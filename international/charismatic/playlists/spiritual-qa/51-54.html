Can the enemy send someone into the church on assignment
0:02
even when the anointing there can the enemy send someone into the church on
0:07
assignment would the anointing affect [Music]
0:13
them so the Bible talks about how job
0:19
actually went to the throne of God like he was in heaven he was in the presence
0:25
of God the devil got to go there and ask him a question actually God starts
0:30
saying have you seen my servant job how faithful he is and the devil then says
0:39
well I want to test this God I ask you this will you allow me to take
0:46
everything from him and test him and God says yes I'll allow you just don't take
0:52
his life his Spirit don't touch a spirit so the devil was actually allowed to go
0:58
into heaven to go into into the presence of God and imagine that is a place
1:04
that's the most holy I mean we have Heaven on Earth here right and when we
1:09
have church it's heaven on Earth but Heaven the throne room of God is just you know the another level the highest
1:17
level but yet the devil was allowed to go there okay so um we live in this
1:25
world where the devil is and so I mean mean sometimes God can allow it is
1:33
really having to do with God allowing for a testing God can allow the devil to
1:40
attack God can allow the devil to attack you know kind of anywhere in this world
1:46
if he can allow him to go into the presence of God in the throne room of Heaven that could happen here on this Earth and I've experienced that um I've
1:55
experienced that as I've ministered I've experienced uh one time
2:00
just someone that was uh just blinded and deceived and wanted to just shout
2:09
that I am false uh this person came to a revivalist now event and he just sat
2:16
there and he waited until the time when deliverance and and deliverance was
2:22
about to start and the Miracles of God were about to begin and it was a time where I was just I was asking people to
2:30
to surrender to God I was was I was encouraging them to surrender their lives to God and prepare themselves to
2:37
receive from God right now such a special precious time and in that moment he just
2:44
start this guy just starts yelling false prophet false prophet at the top of his lungs in front of
2:49
everybody um and glory to God I I um was strengthened
2:58
by God and I didn't like let it bother me I was surprised that was the first um
3:04
but I I didn't let it shake me and um then there was some security that helped
3:11
Usher him out and and then we just continued with the work of God and so
3:16
many people were deliberate it was such a powerful move of God it was one of the most memorable moves of God actually
3:22
that was where some of you probably remember this miracle but um a little
3:27
young baby who I don't know how old she was but she was like a few months she was under half a year for
3:34
sure uh she was crying nonstop and the Lord revealed to
3:40
me this was not just regular baby crying but this was manifesting and I called her and the parents forward and the dad
3:46
had the both the parents had so much faith that God was going to heal her she was actually um she was deaf she was
3:53
deaf in one ear like completely deaf I believe it was she was born that way and
3:59
the the parents had so much faith that God was going to open her ear and heal her and uh they renounced and I declared
4:05
this Spirit to go Spirit of deafness to go and the baby was wailing as I was
4:12
praying and then the moment I said I I think I think I said I decare the spirit
4:17
must leave on three one two three silence the baby immediately stopped
4:22
crying and all of us including me we were literally shocked we were in awe I
4:27
was just speechless then we just started rejoicing and um months later uh the
4:37
parents uh and their children the baby and their other two children they literally drove across the whole us from
4:44
where they were on the East Coast they drove just to come to LA to share the testimony that God opened up her ear and
4:52
it actually happened um later like it wasn't immediately but I think it was just it was a month later or two months
4:58
later like shortly after because that's how sometimes healing happens it's not immediate but that Miracle has taken
5:03
place in the spiritual realm and it's the anointing is working and it's it's
5:09
it's taking time to manifest in the Physical Realm that's how something miracles happen that's why it's so important you have that spiritual
5:15
knowledge and Faith so you don't think oh I guess I didn't receive and you allow the devil to take it when it's just in the
5:21
works but anyways and then actually they came oh they couldn't find our service
5:27
cuz it's when we were in the park so they didn't even get to share it during the church service but they filmed the testimony afterwards and then they drove
5:33
to the Revival now event that week in in Phoenix and shared there it was so powerful so God literally did one of the
5:39
most memorable shocking Miracles I've ever um witnessed that day after all
5:45
that happened so you know God can allow the devil to come in that way sometimes
5:51
even in the midst of the work of God to strengthen us to strengthen me and to
5:57
strengthen the Believers to strengthen our faith so
6:02
that can also happen in the church and I've experienced that happen in the church before I've experienced people coming with bad intentions I've
6:09
experienced um the devil just using somebody in the church and causing
6:14
distraction and and yelling out things and just causing um you know confusion
6:21
and gossip or something I've experienced that but God is so good to just only
6:28
allow what we can handle and um allow the devil to come in these ways
6:35
sometimes to strengthen us and to strengthen our faith and to help us be
6:40
more mature because we have to we have to be mature to know the truth to stand
6:46
in the truth and that When Storms shake when the Devil comes with lies we are not shaken our faith is so firm our
6:53
faith will become firm and strong only when it's tested only when there's an
6:58
opportunity for it to grow and that comes with those with that um the tension of the devil the attacks of the
7:05
devil and
Do you count for a demon to come out
7:10
overcoming do we need to say on three and count for a demon to come out no as you watch me Minister I don't do that
7:17
all the time just sometimes and what that is is just a way of walking in
7:23
Authority um there's different Revelations there's different there's different Revelations
7:28
God will give Serv of God of how to walk in authority and it can sometimes be
7:34
different from person to person how God uses someone in that Authority as Peter
7:39
was used specifically in that shadow you know that's it was like it was kind of
7:44
he might have said something like uh I'm G to walk by and as my shadow descends
7:50
on everybody here every demon must go he might have said something like that and
7:55
that was just a revelation that God gave him you know the power of his authority that he can say something like that and
8:01
the demons will have to obey and so the demons are like oh boy the Shadow's coming we have to go cuz that's what Paul said so uh for one two three it's
8:09
kind of like you know parents say to the children I mean it on three you better
8:16
come to dinner or else you'll be putting time out or something right and um it's
8:23
like the fear of God comes into the children knowing like oh they're really my authority they really mean what they
8:30
say if I don't obey there will be repercussions because I know they're Authority I know they're not playing
8:37
around I know I know I can't get away with it and so it kind of can bring a
8:43
sharpness rather than like get here now or um on three you better be here or
8:50
else right so it's kind of like that so um the one two three is just a way to
8:57
walk in authority it's not like it's a better way it's not like it's a more powerful way and it isn't something that
9:03
should be done as a routine as a tradition and nothing when you're ministering should really be done as
9:10
routine as tradition I mean there should always be room for the Holy Spirit when
9:16
it comes to Deliverance it's not like a formula there are keys and that it's true that some
9:23
keys most uh most times you need to use these Keys like renouncing can be a
9:28
thing for a lot of the time that that's a key but it's important you don't have
9:34
in your mind every person must renounce for example you know it's important you're not having that in your mind and
9:40
treating it as something um as like a checklist and
9:47
[Music] removing the space for the Holy Spirit
9:52
right so so yeah so I mean there's different ways to walk in authority there's
9:57
different ways to command the demons and to say you you must leave on three is is
10:05
one of them how do we know when we are completely free from all
How do we know if we have a demon
10:12
demons so the way to discern that you have demons is when a force is
10:19
controlling you because you there's a difference between your flesh being strong and The
10:27
Temptations being really strong to overeat do drugs do alcohol have sex
10:32
watch porn what have so many things um there's
10:38
a difference between that when your flesh is strong the Temptation is great but technically you're still able
10:46
to push the flesh down with the help of the holy spirit with discipline um and
10:53
with a heart to really obey God um you're able to do it it's it's
10:59
uncomfortable because the Temptation is so strong it's uncomfortable it can be painful but you're able to do it you're
11:04
you're able like if the Temptation was so strong to have a drink of alcohol
11:10
that drink could be sitting there and you would have the power to not take that drink even if you're thinking about
11:17
it so much even if your mouth is watering or something even if you have so many
11:23
thoughts of like an fear and stuff and anxiety stress and you're just like oh I
11:29
just had a drink or something but at the end of the day you do have the willpower and strength with the strength with the
11:35
help of the Holy Spirit to say no it's just really uncomfortable probably that's when the flesh is strong but no
11:42
demon inside but then when a demon when one has a demon of addiction to alcohol they
11:49
will try everything they will be praying they will be fasting they will do everything in their
11:56
might to to not take that drink but if that drink is sitting there they will
12:01
end up drinking it you know you see like these I've seen you see like
12:07
documentaries and things of of drug addicts and it's like they don't even want it to they're just it's a force
12:13
that's controlling them so that's a quick summary of of how to know if you
12:19
have a demon is that it's going to be a force that's controlling you that even with so much willpower with the strength
12:25
of the Holy Spirit inviting God in and real surrendered heart that you really want to obey God because that's that's
12:32
the biggest key to be able to push on the Flesh and resist
12:37
temptation the only thing will give you power to do that really is surrender to God love for God surrender to God your
12:44
greatest passion to be in his will because your passion to obey him
12:49
trumps the power of the flesh um so that's like a quick summary
Demons in the mind
12:57
for you to know uh uh but it can get more complex with knowing when the devil
13:05
is really come in your mind because a lot of people when it comes to the mind they
13:12
they think they still have demons but they don't that's the hardest place for
13:19
people to discern that actually the demons the the devil's coming outwardly you're free in
13:25
the mind but the devil's coming outwardly and you like so so strong like the thoughts the feelings
13:32
um are so intense that people think they're demonized um but that's when you have to
13:40
renew your mind renew your mind again renew your mind again reject the devil again and again and again and again a
13:47
lot of people um sometimes there's even fake manifestations because the power of the
13:52
Mind the mind has so much power the mind is so powerful as a
13:58
man or woman thinks so he or she is so if you know you've been set free and
14:07
you really can see you're free and even if this your servant of God spiritual
14:13
mother father is saying prophetically you are free there's no more Demons Inside you um sometimes God will lead me
14:19
to say that because the devil's lying so much to the person and the person needs to know they're free so you can hear
14:25
that you can believe that but then the devil can come outwardly and say you're not fully free yet you have demons still
14:32
and come so strongly with the the past ways of demons inside but coming
14:38
outwardly in the mind so the devil ends up tricking people so strongly um you
14:44
still have demons you know see these issues in your mind and even in your body even it could be physical it could
14:51
be health things you see you see all these issues in your mind so strongly see you have demons still the Devil
14:57
Comes so strongly in the mind in this way for some people and um and and and
15:04
then he'll he he he'll speak this so strongly and he'll literally well when people are manifesting it becomes every
15:11
it becomes almost muscle memory and the devil will literally send I mean you're you
15:19
everything's connected to your mind like your body right so the way that manifestations would happen before the
15:25
devil can like send feelings to to your mind you know what I I mean feel sorry feelings to
15:31
like your hands or your arms or whatever the ways that you would manifest or Screaming the devil can use the mind and
15:38
like send uh I'm like kind of speaking of a science of it now like you can the what
15:46
the devil's doing the mind can be so powerful that it's it's it's controlling
15:51
the body like demons aren't controlling your body and inwardly but when you are
15:58
are are are not Discerning the devil's lies he can end up controlling you
16:03
outwardly so much that he can control your mind so if the devil can trick you and think to make you think you still
16:10
have demons you see how all these things in your life you're still dealing with but really it's the devil so coming so
16:15
strongly in your mind and it's a process for your mind to be renewed and you have to really discipline your mind uh or be
16:20
disciplined to do these spiritual things reject the devil renew your mind but I mean the devil will say you see you are
16:27
demonized still you see you still have demons and so a person will believe that
16:32
a person will believe these outward lies of the devil you have demons a person will believe it and they'll go I still
16:39
have demons so as the Bible says as a man
16:44
thinks thinketh so he or she is same with a woman as a man or woman thinks so
16:50
he or she is so that's how powerful your mind is so the devil wants to try to get you to think I still have demons this is
16:57
for some people for for some people you do still have demons and you need layer upon layer of Deliverance okay and it's
17:03
it's healthy for you to know that you need more Deliverance okay but I'm just saying this is for some people um the
17:09
devil will get you to think I have demons still and so when you think that
17:15
it really becomes your reality so much that I mean you don't have demons still but your body is even like
17:21
manifesting because of the power of your mind so it's like you're demonized you
17:27
aren't but it as I'm man or woman thinks so she here or she
Alcohol
17:33
is so alcohol I like wine twice a week with dinner is that okay I fast it
17:38
regularly so no addiction gets in I don't get drunk only in the Holy Spirit I feel like the devil has been lying to
17:44
me about this um so yes the Bible says that you
17:51
should not get drunk in wine but be drunk in the Holy Spirit I think that a lot of people the
17:56
reason they like alcohol is because of the feeling it gives them the
18:02
buzz even if it's not drunk so Christians they still like that feeling of being Buzz some of them and and and
18:08
and and for some Christians it's like they like the buzz and they like the taste together and sometimes they like
18:13
the taste because they go together it reminds them of the buzz So like um if you used to
18:22
drink to get the buzz and drink to get drunk that was the purpose of it you
18:27
probably remember you would you would really acquire a taste and the the the first sip would be so gratifying but
18:35
it's not that it's like so particularly yummy usually but it's more of like the psychological thing of like a buzz is
18:43
coming you know um so when it comes to
18:49
alcohol to have it in moderation is not a bad thing to have to have it um once
18:57
in a while is not a bad thing but the and and this is the thing when it comes
19:03
to a lot of things in the Bible when it comes to a lot of issues like this are not in the Bible but when it comes to a
19:09
lot of spiritual things when it comes to Everyday Things of a Believer like should I do this or shouldn't I do this
19:14
there might be some things where I will say do not do this obviously do not do witchcraft you know do not watch horror
19:21
movies but then when it comes to like other movies I'm not going to go through this whole list and say this is the
19:27
genre you can watch this is the one you can't watch you can watch PG but not PG-13 or R I'm not going to do that
19:34
right no that's becomes religion but what I want to do is teach you to be
19:40
spiritual to make wise decisions in the spirit rather than say you can drink or
19:47
you or don't drink I don't want to say that I actually want you to walk in wisdom with the holy spirit because that's what's really important that's
19:53
how you're going to be walking by the spirit rather than walking religiously and that's when you're going to be
19:58
making decisions based on what God is telling you directly and um like conviction for you specifically and
20:06
that's um how you're really going to be hearing his voice and following it specifically for you and that's what we
20:13
want So my answer is this um when it comes to alcohol why do
20:22
you want to drink it if it is just the taste then that's fine and if you
20:31
have an amount that doesn't really bring a buzz now a light Buzz isn't that much
20:38
and right it doesn't affect you too much like I think for driving you can legally
20:43
have one drink but most uh people like
20:49
women or like people who are um don't weigh much one drink they won't feel a
20:55
buzz but technically they're able to drive still so um but I the Bible says don't get drunk um on wine and a lot of
21:03
people like because they want to still drink they'll be like well I'm I just have a slight Buzz not drunk um but um
21:10
you know the holy spirit is is the greatest High and the greatest influence
21:17
on our mind and our body on our spirit the the holy spirit is the greatest
21:23
relaxer bringer of Peace bringer of abundant
21:28
Joy um definitely the Holy Spirit trumps what alcohol does the the the
21:36
feeling that comes from alcohol definitely trumps and so we want to make sure that we are craving to be drunk
21:43
with the Holy Spirit and we are not craving to be even slightly buzzed by alcohol that's what we want and if we're
21:50
not if we're not having that feeling that craving that's telling us that we
21:56
do need to fast alcohol and maybe fast it for an extended amount of time so
22:02
that God Can Transform us to get us to that place where we're never ever even Desiring alcohol simply because we don't
22:09
desire the buzz that comes from it and I'm talking specifically if you like the buzz if you just like the taste of it
22:16
then that's okay but I would still probably not like drink a very small
22:21
amount like probably not even a whole glass if the glass ends up giving you a buzz not that the buzz is like
22:28
really bad or anything I'm just what I'm saying is is that many people enjoy the buzz so that's why it's we shouldn't
22:34
like enjoy the buzz we should only enjoy buzz from the Holy Spirit you know not that having the buzz is making you do
22:41
all these sinful things but I'm talking more of a higher maturity in the
22:48
spirit so really the answer lies within you like what because many times we do
22:54
things without really looking at why we're doing them why we want to do the things what really the motive is if
23:02
there's things influencing our past and that's why we do the thing do the thing bring us Comfort because in the past it
23:08
used to bring us Comfort when we needed it but now we have God to bring us comfort and so we don't need that
23:14
anymore so we should you know like look within when it comes to um alcohol look within with God and
23:24
um my uh my encourage my my invitation for all of you is to get to that place
23:30
where you only want to be buzzed with the Holy Spirit and you're not having
23:36
that desire um to to have a buzz from from alcohol and it's different for
23:43
everyone because like me God convicted me particularly me like for my calling
23:49
as a servant of God I feel like I'm on call for God all the time you know I feel like
23:58
I'm on call to hear from him so I don't want anything to numb my spiritual
24:04
senses even if it's late at night don't have anything planned I still want to be
24:11
sharp in the spirit for him to speak to me for him to be able to use me um as a
24:20
pure vessel with nothing like numbed or
24:25
um nothing getting in the way and really by the way what I just shared
24:31
with you that wisdom that applies for so many different things like what movie to watch what music to listen to to hang
24:39
out with this group of people to go to this event to go to this concert many
24:45
people want to just hear the answer should I do this or should I not I want to do this but I if it's in God's will
24:51
then I won't do it but I really want to do it so should you know a lot of people they that's why they're they're ask
24:57
asking many times and um but the but the real answer to make sure you're really going by conviction and that's how God
25:04
wants it to be he wants it he doesn't want to be legalistic he doesn't want to be like I told you not to do this so
25:10
that's why you're not doing it but he wants it to be like he wants you to be like I want to please God father Lord
Do this or not
25:18
should I do this or not does this please you or not like that's what he wants rather than what's the rule to be a
25:25
Christian because then you're like just coming out of love for God you're obeying him out of love for him and not
25:33
being forced and not just following rules that's what God
25:39
wants so if you have questions about other areas like is this movie okay to watch is this do what I just shared with
25:49
you to hear the wisdom the voice of the Holy
25:55
Spirit how do you know if renouncing is a key your deliverance everyone should renounce
Everyone should renounce
26:02
everyone should renounce so I mean this is just something we should do as a Believer because renouncing is rejecting
26:07
the devil it's taking your Authority in Christ it's taking a stand and saying I
26:13
don't want these things this bondage this sickness the I don't want this
26:19
portion anymore coming from the enemy I don't want it and I don't want those
26:24
open doors and those open doors that this came through or this might came through I don't want to be connected to
26:30
those open doors anymore I want to send I want that to come out of that like you
26:35
came in this way get out and I'm sh and the open door shut I I I it's like
26:40
saying I regret doing that I the the me now would not open that door and is not
26:47
opening that door so I renounce that so how to how to know if renouncing
26:54
is a key to your deliverance it's not like you have to like know it every
26:59
believer should every believer should renounce because that's just an
27:04
important part of it's an important part of walking in your Authority and rejecting the devil and it happens to be
27:11
a key for many people to be free can you expound on last week's live
27:16
how Christians with demons are likely luk are likely lukewarm and then Jesus will spit them out of his mouth and not
27:21
receive eternal life okay yes so last week I was talking about how some PE I
27:27
there was a question I answered someone said how do we respond when people say you're so demon focused and that's
27:34
because the church has IGN I mean for the most part the church has ignored the fact that demons exist ignored the fact
27:41
that we are called to cast out demons as such a big part of our ministry and such a big part of the work that's done in
27:46
the church and the the church is blinded to the truth that demons are so
27:53
prevalent and actually probably in this state right now more than half of Christians are
28:00
oppressed with demons probably it's fair to say um and so I was sharing
Emergency situation
28:08
how to be um to be teaching
28:13
about um the reality of demonic oppression and how to be free and to be
28:18
casting out demons regularly is to love God's people is to obey God
28:25
and is to do the most important work right now because there's so many people in bondage with
28:31
demons that they don't need to be they should be free and it's a 911 emergency situation right now specifically right
28:37
now in the body of Christ it won't it won't be this bad this emergency for forever but specifically right now it's
28:44
really emergency like there's just so much demon casting out happening because
28:50
people need to be free and I also shared how
Casting out demons
28:56
um it's also really urgent for us to to be casting out demons and teaching
29:02
people about the reality that you can be oppressed by demons and how to be free because so many people with
29:09
demons are many times not surrendered because the oppression is like a chain
29:15
on them uh keeping them from seeing God's love fully and experiencing his
29:20
love and and when you encounter God's power and meet Jesus that's when you are
29:26
able to really surrender when you actually meet him in power um and then
29:31
you can fall in love with him so um without people really encountering Jesus
29:37
in power without people's eyes opening up to how amazing he is many time most
29:42
times they're lukewarm that was how I was um before I encountered God in power and so if people have
29:48
demons most likely they've never encountered God's power or or maybe just in a very small
The lukewarm
29:55
way so um yeah well the Bible talks about how the lukewarm will be spit out by God in the
30:01
re in the Book of Revelation so we don't know we don't know um we don't know we
30:08
don't know anyone's salvation that's like if they will go to heaven or hell you know each Christian we can't say
30:15
like we can't judge them God's God Only God knows God's the judge and God is the one with so much grace and mercy we
30:21
don't know what happens um when a person dies the the the the chances that they
30:27
get again you know but what we do know is that we need to really not take it lightly we need to have the fear of God
30:33
in terms of surrendering to him and not being lukewarm so it's not something to play around with so if you if your eyes
30:41
aren't open up to God's love which comes as you encounter him in power many
30:46
people are lukewarm and that's not something to play around with it's not something to be like so afraid of if you
30:53
have family members friends who are lukewarm right now you don't don't need to have so much fear are they going to
Fear of God
31:00
go to hell they have time they have time they have time to really meet Jesus and
31:09
surrender God is so good he has gives Grace so we have the fear of God it's
31:14
really urgent and important that's why we have to be the best FES of God we can be in terms of like sharing testimony
31:20
spreading the word being unashamed and bold about Jesus and his fullness who
31:25
comes in power we should have the fear of God you know for our family and
31:31
friends who are lukewarm and everybody in the world that's lukewarm and lost and be the best vessel of God we can so
31:36
we we need to have the fear of God in that way to really go to work to take it seriously because people's lives depend
31:41
on it people's salvation depends on it um but at the same time don't be
31:47
paranoid don't freak out don't be afraid rest in God he's a good god he's a good
31:52
God he gives people many chances his grace is abundant and he understands
31:58
situation upon situation like some people like me I was born in a Christian
32:04
home and um I was just given uh just so
32:10
much great favor that a lot of people don't have and so if someone grew up in
32:15
a home where they were abused where they were um never introduced to Jesus never
32:21
taken to church uh you know God is going to have God is going to like give that person
32:27
more time and chances and opportunity he's a good God you know so just rest
Resist the Devil
32:34
that he's a good God and that he's really giving people chances and giving
32:39
people Grace
32:45
amen can the enemy discern lack of confidence when truth is being spoken
32:50
does this give him any kind of legal
32:56
access resist the devil and he must flee so
33:03
whether you say I reject this lie of the devil in my
33:10
head I am free or whether you say I reject this lie of the devil I am
33:19
free I reject you I am freid like it does not matter it does not matter he has to flee
33:28
and [Music] um the the devil has to respond to that he
33:35
h he has to respond to that and we are human we are human and so
33:42
we're going to be tired sometimes we're going to be full of energy sometimes we are going to be in a great mood sometimes we can be in like not so great
33:49
a mood sometimes and that doesn't even have to do with anything spiritual I'm just saying circumstances of life and um
33:57
being a human sometimes you're tired sometimes you're fully awake like sometimes just something amazing happens
God is not looking at the feelings
34:02
and just just makes you just extra happy and sometimes it's it's a different day
34:09
where you still have the joy of the Lord but it looks so differently and you're not crazy perky but you s Joy the Lord
34:16
and what you have to realize is like God God is not looking at the feelings
34:24
he he just wants to see the action he wants to see the action and so it's
34:30
like the same for the devil in the spiritual realm the devil's looking at the
34:35
action um the devil's not like really impressed when you're sounding extra
34:41
confident and he's like wow I really can't get to her or him because of their
34:46
confidence great it's um it's more about uh sustainability it's more about that
34:53
you keep showing up so on a day where um um you don't have as much energy or you
34:59
don't have as much feelings of confidence but you still reject the
35:05
devil you still are a warrior he's rejected just the same the Bible says resist the devil submit to
35:11
God resist the devil and he will flee simple so it doesn't have to mean it's a
35:16
resisting him with a loud voice full of confidence or a small voice without the
35:23
feelings of confidence you just have to resist him you just have to resist him
35:29
and like even when you're going through a lot and you don't feel as strong but
35:35
you still show up that actually impresses the devil like it shows like
35:40
they're going through all of this great and they're still strong great like that's what the devil's like so um I I
35:48
wouldn't worry too much thinking about how the devil hear reads your voice but
35:54
I would just more focus on seeking God doing what he's calling you
36:00
to do and um making sure that you're getting your soul to align with your
36:05
feelings because you do want to be confident you do want you don't want to be wimpy resisting the devil all the
36:11
time you do want to walk in that strong confidence every day because otherwise it there will be a day
36:17
where you might break so you need to be more focused on just making sure you're
36:24
Renewing Your Mind you are making sure you're getting your soul in alignment
36:29
with the spiritual truth so that you don't have to worry about how you sound
36:35
confidence wise but it's just naturally happening you do sound confident natural wise because you're just focused simply
36:41
on that on obeying God and and doing what he's calling you to do in terms of Renewing Your Mind
36:47
daily and and and being spiritual being spiritual not
36:53
carnal but I will say so and it's more about knowing your Authority actually
Knowing your Authority
37:00
that that the devil recognizes and obeys more that's what I do want to say though
37:06
re but I'm not talking about feelings I'm not talking about um how your voice
37:12
sounds or something but I'm talking about knowing your Authority on Sunday I talked about this what makes demons go
37:17
and this also applies to just walking in Authority so attacks from the devil what
37:22
makes them go is when they see that you do have authority when they see that you know you have authority like you're
37:29
confident in your Authority And when they see you executing your Authority
Attacks from the Devil
37:34
properly so [Music] um
37:39
so I mean like if I have a bad dream I'll wake up and I'll just say I'm tired
37:46
you know I just woke go I reject that dream go back to sleep you know um but
37:52
some person but but some person must be like I can't believe I had that dream I
37:58
for that dream and and the devil might be like oh man they don't realize like actually the
38:04
power of their Authority that they can just simply speak it and that's all they have to do so you are giving a little
38:10
insight to the devil if you're not understanding your really The Authority you have and that's why it's
38:16
so powerful and important to be walking in the power of God with Simplicity that's what God has called me
38:23
to do this is what God has is bringing in this Rev IAL is is the revelation of
38:29
the power of God how powerful it is and that we need to let God shine and we do
38:37
not have to get in the way with theatrics with a loud voice with physical efforts but we can be simple
Let God Shine
38:45
and let God God's power do the work we can move simply we can command simply we
38:51
can Minister simply so um I mean I have that great
38:58
conviction from God you know to to to to to never unnecessarily scream at demons um and
39:06
use a lot of physical Force I have that great conviction from God
39:12
because if I were to do that it's actually showing the demons that this
39:17
goes with what I was saying on Sunday it shows the demons that I don't really see in the spiritual realm that well that I
39:24
don't understand how it works I don't understand what really makes demons go
39:30
that it's Authority not level of voice not physical effort Authority um I don't understand Kingdom
39:37
I don't understand Authority that speaks that to demons and so they will literally try to fool around that's how
39:44
it is with demons like with a teacher if it's a um substitute teacher that walks
39:49
in they brand new the kids are going to try to play around and see we don't know
39:55
we don't know how they know their Authority let's let's fool around and then let's say The Substitute Teacher
40:01
isn't doing the greatest job right oh they're they're going to be motivated to really screw around
40:07
more but when a teacher really knows their Authority and disciplines and you
40:13
know the kids can't get away with anything they don't even try it's a waste of time to try it's it's a waste
40:21
so they have respect too so they literally don't even try to push buttons
40:27
they don't try to find a way that we they can get around the
40:32
authority so that teacher will have great success like that teacher their job will be easy compared to someone
40:40
like a substitute teacher or just a teacher doesn't know their Authority where these kids are really
40:46
trying um so that's how it is in the spiritual realm so um like when you walk
40:52
in your Authority properly and it shows that the demons know
40:57
you know how it works in the spiritual realm you know that it's about the authority you you know that if you
41:02
simply command they have to go it when that when it shows them that then they
41:09
don't fool around then they obey better and that's how that's how it works with
41:15
every spiritual principle when it comes to walking in authority and Kingdom government like what I was teaching on
41:21
Sunday that's why I say it's so important you need to have like you need to have that conviction of I must do it
41:27
right I must not do it an old wines skinn way I must not do it a way that I want to do I must not do it in a way that makes somebody else more
41:32
comfortable another Minister more comfortable I got to do how God wants or else demons are not going to obey as
41:38
well and that's a serious deal so as I shared on Sunday I shared about how the importance of um how it's one person
41:46
executing the authority at one time like during a time of ministry or when you
41:51
are walking in your dominion and praying for someone it should be just you you
41:57
casting the demon out not calling someone else and you work together and command the demon to go together that's
42:04
not how it works in in terms of the principle of authority so when you do
42:11
that sort of thing when you start thinking like you start doing other things like putting hands and everything
42:17
you know it's the authority that makes demons go so putting hands doesn't have
42:24
anything to do with authority the teacher in the classroom does not have to touch the children to get them to
42:31
obey in fact that would be wrong it would be like using a different Force because you're not walking in your
42:38
Authority that's how it is in the spiritual realm that's why I never put hands on a person to cast a
42:44
demon out I put hands to release anointing after they have been delivered
42:50
to release healing the anointing to release healing to release baptism the Holy Spirit to release a of anointing
42:57
but I never um put hands to try to make Authority
43:07
happen and that's when you become more effective that's when demons respect more and go quicker and mo more more of
43:16
them leave can you talk a little bit about retaliation from witches every time I talk to a certain family member about
43:22
God Deliverance I always get attacked either through dreams people Etc how can
43:27
I pray so if this person is open to hearing God they want to hear God they want to hear about these things that
Open to hearing God
43:33
you're talking to them about like they're open they're want Desiring then that's good keep doing that if they are
43:40
not open but it's if they are not really open they don't really want to hear it do not be talking about God and all
43:47
these things until they are opening up Don't Force
43:53
because if you force things it's like going out inside of God's principles and so inside God's principles is where
44:00
there's the grace outside of God's principles there's not you're stepping outside the grace it's like leaving room
44:07
for the enemy to attack so sometimes like people they're not meaning to disobey God they're not like sinning and
44:13
doing bad things they're doing things with a really good heart but they've just stepped outside of the
44:20
principles of God and it it it opens the door for the enemy me to
44:27
attack so if the person that you the person you're talking to is open to hearing from God then you have authority
44:34
there you have authority there you should not have fear there in your book you said along the lines of having how
44:40
you should have one spiritual father or mother how do we know for sure who your
44:48
spiritual who our spiritual father or mother is and do we all have one
Spiritual Father or Mother
44:57
yes you every person should have one every person should have one and um but
45:04
everyone's going to receive them at different times and different seasons of their life and to have a spiritual father or mother it's going to be the
45:11
the the leader of the ministry that the church that God is calling you to be
45:17
planted in to serve him at and there you will receive impartation there and
45:23
equipping to accomplish your purpose this looks different for a lot of people it will not be
45:31
um you know uh how people traditionally think of like Mentor like one onone
45:38
talking all the time but really for most people it's I mean someone just Alysa
45:45
just said right now every single time she gets all of her questions answered and some that she didn't even know she needed that's just this example of how
45:52
God uses spiritual father or mother uh in
45:57
this way to equip to perfectly equip fully equip the spiritual
46:03
children and impartation is released as you tune in as you come in person as you
46:09
serve God impartation of anointing is being released upon your life and as you
46:15
are planted you are in God's will when you are planted where he wants you to be and
46:22
that means that he brings you what you need when you need it if you need a specific if it's a specific word like a
46:29
prophetic specific word that's what happened for me if that's what you need
46:34
God will do that but it will be in his perfect timing it won't be when you want it it'll be in his timing um it just
46:43
what you need is there God is control there God knows what his
46:49
sheep need there he knows the equipping they need the direction they need and he takes care of it there how you will know
46:58
who your spiritual father or mother is um I mean it's different for for for for a lot of people but for most people
47:04
it'll be um God you the holy spirit is leading you to come to a church let's
47:10
say fivefold church for example and you are tasting fruits of the spirit like
47:17
never before like in your own personal life you're you're you're you're you're
47:22
falling more in love with God your eyes spirit opening up more to his love and the
47:28
things of the spirit you're drawing closer to him and you are getting freed
47:34
if you need to be delivered of things things are falling off you you're experiencing the miraculous power of God
47:40
in your life you're seeing those kinds of fruits you're seeing fruits happening you're you're being brought closer to
47:46
God and you're seeing the inheritance of Abundant Life pouring
47:53
down upon your life um and when you hear teaching it is really feeding your
48:00
spirit it's really helping you spiritually it is really opening your
48:05
eyes and when it's your spiritual mother or father you will really notice that difference you will see a difference
48:12
there than other places you've gone and you'll feel this peace in your spirit
48:17
joy in your spirit your spirit even leaping like when you're hearing the teachings when you're at the church or
48:23
watching live your spirit is leaping you you just feel content and at peace and
48:29
you're really Experiencing God his power his love um that those are some big
48:37
indicators for most people of the Holy Spirit speaking to you this is your
48:42
spiritual father or mother and I want you to be planted here it's a prophetic of what's to come
48:50
so the fruits you're experiencing in that first service first week or first month
48:57
or first couple months or first year the fruits you're experiencing in your life
49:04
and in your relationship to God and the power of God you're experiencing that's
49:09
prophetic of what's to come it's per it's like just it's like
49:15
if this is what you're experiencing now you know that your life will be full of
49:21
God's power and his purpose and his love overflowing an abundant life you start
49:28
to experience deliverance and you've been stuck for so long and maybe you still need layers or maybe you're not
49:35
completely freeing the Mind from the outward attacks of the devil but you've already experienced so much different so
49:41
you know that change is going to continue to come you you
49:47
know it's just going to keep getting better it's just going to keep increasing the glory of God the power of
49:54
God in your life and the desires of your heart being fulfilled seek first the kingdom of God
50:00
and all these things will be added so you're seeking God where he wants you and things are going to start to be
50:05
added that you've longed for for a long time that have never come they're going
50:11
to start to be added Delight in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart so as you're delighting in the
50:17
Lord in his will you're being planted you're going to start to see desires of your heart be fulfilled that you've
50:23
longed for for so long so if you are seeing the fruits don't go
50:30
anywhere don't go anywhere and know what's to come get excited and expectant
50:36
for what's to come value value value value so you so because the devil don't
50:42
want you there that's the one that's the place the devil doesn't want you the most the devil the devil would rather have you
50:50
worshiping in churches 24/7 he'd rather have you doing that and
50:55
evangelizing every second of your life and not be where you're called to be planted he'd rather you be doing all
51:02
of that then be planted where you're called to be planted so he'll want he'll want to try to take you away so that's
51:08
why you have to value and make the decision I'm not going anywhere devil can never take me from here so what if a
51:14
person or individuals are constantly highlighted to you who are religious and they are not
51:21
open to it I think you mean open to like the power of God and the deeper
51:27
spiritual truth that that God's showed you they're not open to it do you think I should stop approaching them as I feel
51:34
attacked approach people with love minister to them with love do not be preaching at them until they want it
Approaching People with Love
51:41
that opens up people for attack from the devil prophesying to people when they don't want it opens up for attack you
51:48
can prophesy to strangers but only if they are open love them first begin to speak to
51:56
them with love begin to just be normal and full of love not like on this
52:02
mission to convert or something you know what I mean like just love them just just just talk to them with love don't
52:10
talk to them with this like plan to convert them like just love them because
52:15
some are called to plant seeds some are called to water and some are called to harvest and sometimes because God
52:23
doesn't rush things we rush things God is so much slower than most of us want the way he is in our own lives in
52:31
terms of like promises being fulfilled he feels so slow to most of us but he's
52:36
not slow it's just that we're too fast okay so the way he is in that
52:42
regard um is also how he is and towards people in their
52:49
salvation he wants it's like um it's it's like we want to quickly run
52:56
and get married someone might want to run and quick get married but it would be better to really organically develop
53:04
relationship both parties truly fall in love and in the right time maybe this is
53:11
two years down the road three years down the road maybe even four years down the road I don't know the right time they
53:17
both desire to get married at this right one's not forcing the
53:23
other then that they're getting married at the right time and that's going to
53:28
close that's going to keep them from having um Division and arguments and all
53:36
these arguments and all this incompat incompatibility stuff because they went
53:42
slow and at the right pace and the right timing so that's how it is with God God
53:48
does not want to force himself on people God does not want to enter into in a
53:55
arranged marriage with his children and many times were these like
54:00
parents trying to force an arranged marriage with God and somebody and um that doesn't do any good
54:07
it it really does not help at all we were thinking we're doing such such great things for God and we're getting
54:12
in the way so that's why I say God plants got some people plant seeds sometimes God's
54:19
calling you to plant seed which means simply love not even do any kind of preaching love them and if they're open
54:25
to hearing your testimony start out with testimony don't start off with like do you know Jesus do you like you
54:31
know don't be religious and and and and and and come in this way that's
54:36
literally looking like you're trying to force something and convert somebody because so many so many people so many
54:43
people are not dumb so many people have experienced that they've experienced this religiousness people
54:49
trying to convert them trying to force them people coming in judgment away
54:54
people people coming with not real love but on a on a mission to convert but not really loving them on a mission to get a
55:01
notch on their belt a lot of people in this world have actually encountered that a lot of people a lot of people I
55:07
mean I know that for me there's been a few times maybe I'm just going in public
55:12
places where I've encountered someone saying that even saying to me or something like do you know Jesus but I
55:17
could tell it was like in this um forceful way you know I mean it's really prevalent that people have encountered
55:24
this like force um trying to convert things
55:30
so um it's it it's it's not good to to come in that same way it's better to
55:36
just love them to really love them where they're at and start to plant seeds and um just be organic maybe God
55:44
will lead you to um maybe they'll end up asking you about your life and you just happen to share that you love God you
55:51
just you it's somehow seen that you're a Christian but it doesn't always have to be like seen I'm a Christian for the
55:57
seed to be planted sometimes the seed will just be planted there they will encounter love and it will literally
56:03
just like open up their heart to receive the love of God coming from somebody else later where they like open up you
56:08
know um but it's like seed by seed by seed for a person and then comes the
56:13
right time for um the person's ready to like learn more about God hear more
56:19
about God and that's a time for that person then to water and then but then that person's
56:25
still not ready to get their life to Jesus they're just inquiring they're getting curious still not time yet and
56:31
then eventually is the Harvest Time and the Harvest doesn't always look like repeat the prayer after me sometimes the
56:36
Harvest looks like um someone says to you I want to give my
56:43
life to Jesus how how do I and you can just say well in the Bible it says you just need to believe in your heart and
56:49
and say with your words you say out loud that Jesus You're My Lord Jesus You're
56:55
My Savior Jesus I'm giving my life to you you are Lord just simple and that's
57:01
it and you're saved it's could be an explanation or maybe it's um just a
57:06
person doesn't even need that explanation but they you invite them to church and they end up giving their life
57:11
to Jesus to church and saying Jesus I give you my life at some point in church just even maybe after en counting God's
57:20
power so approach people if God is calling you to but only with love not on a like some kind of converting
