0:00
could you share a word regarding flourish Dallas I have a feeling that's it's going to be powerful and have a brain to come back to come from afar
0:08
even though I just came to the US I feel to come back to us from Europe
0:14
yeah yes I feel this so deep in my heart for people to
0:21
not miss Dallas I I feel this very deeply in my heart I feel I feel this
0:28
um it's it's like so it's like so I I know I've spoken the day of Pentecost
0:34
for LA but it's like a pentec day of Pentecost movement
0:39
where it's like not everyone was there on the day of Pentecost right not everyone was there a
0:47
lot of people were missing out a lot of people ended up coming later they
0:52
weren't there in the beginning and to this day we when we
0:59
think about when we think about the powerful move of Holy Spirit we think about the day of
1:04
Pentecost imagine the people that would have missed out on the day of Pentecost because of laziness because of
1:10
skepticism because of lukewarmness because of just listening to the enemy's lies
1:16
imagine the regret I mean they would have really missed out yeah and
1:22
so we are in this precious season now we are in such a precious season now and
1:28
it's just I mean I mean having to do with what I just shared about how it reminds me so much of a season of
1:36
um that time where so many people were unsure about Jesus because there's Pharisees coming
1:43
with all these lies and everything and there weren't Pharisees endorsing there weren't F Jesus did not have
1:49
endorsements Jesus did not have any Christian leaders endorsing him any think about that he didn't have any
1:57
Christian leaders endorsing him if he were to be writing Christian books he would have no forwards or endorsements or anything he nothing nothing nothing
2:05
no one endorsing him so he was so controversial he was he was looked at as
2:13
I don't know this is weird people aren't supporting him that you would think should be if he's really real d y y you
2:21
know he preaches a sermon that's full of new wine controversial about eat my flesh drink
2:27
my blood and most of his disciples left him thousands of his disciples left him and only 12 remain and he says to the 12
2:34
will you leave me too and they say where could we go and I think most people it would be
2:42
people's biggest dream to be among the 12 right probably most of anyone's dream
2:48
if they could you know go back in time or something or just just to to to be there to be
2:55
among the TW right you know that was reserved for those those who had
3:00
precious Hearts chosen ones those who did not have fear of man those who were willing to pick up their cross and
3:06
follow Jesus anywhere those who would surrender everything and Jesus is the same
3:12
yesterday today and forever and so how Jesus is coming and his Revival it's the same thing it's the same thing yes he
3:18
moves through he moves through um servants like how he moved through Peter and how he moved through Paul he moves
3:25
through different servants today but it's Jesus we're talking about it's Jesus who is it's Jesus who is the head
3:31
of the ministry of Peter the ministry of Paul the ministry of my Ministry Apostle
3:38
Katherine's Ministry fivefold Church's Ministry it it's Jesus we are serving he
3:43
is King he is Lord it is his work for me I didn't come up with my own business my
3:49
own work I'm serving Jesus Jesus is my boss you know this whole fivefold church
3:57
the whole Ministry the Abol the prophetic the new wine the Deliverance this is Jesus's
4:04
work so I'm the servant we're all Servants of Jesus right and so like like
4:11
here again we have today in today's time in this revival it's a time again of will you
4:20
follow Jesus or not will you be a coward or not will you be all in or not will you pick up your cross or not will you
4:27
get out of your comfort zone or not will you fear man or or not will you be among
4:32
the 12 that says where else could we go or not will you be among those small group of people that were there on the
4:38
day of Pentecost or not so now Christianity is the most popular
4:45
religion in the whole world so Seasons really change Seasons really
4:52
change now it's not it's Seasons changed so in this revival it's going to be the
4:57
same way like like I said like there was constrictions holding back Jesus those
5:04
constrictions of doubt and skepticism and false accusations and jealousy and
5:10
pride and all these things that were holding back people from fear of man holding back people from uh following
5:17
Jesus fully and so we have Jesus here in the flesh but only 12 can stand beside
5:23
him after showing all of his miracles after thousands following him and then retreating you know
5:30
and then the season change changes now where Christianity is the most popular
5:36
religion in the whole world so this is how it is going to be today there's going to come a time where in this reviv
5:44
like right now Deliverance the power of God Apostles prophets the new wine all
5:49
of these aspects of God's Revival they're
5:56
unpopular they're controversial so that leads it to be like the minority of
6:02
Christians being a part of but the seasons will change praise
6:08
God similar similarly to kathern Coleman times similarly to Amy Simple mcferson
6:13
Times that's kind of a good example of it I mean Katherine colan times and Amy
6:18
SE mcferson times they literally had to turn people away from a stadiums they were they were ministering well Le I
6:24
don't know about Amy simple but kathern kulan I heard I read this I read this in the biographies of her that she would
6:31
have Stadium events all the time and people had to be turned away there was too many people coming they couldn't
6:38
come into the stadium tough luck you know you they could still
6:43
receive outside the stadium though praise God but um That season was not always that way
6:50
for kathern kman though you know she started out very small she started out a very very small
6:56
Ministry with a handful of people right and so um
7:01
then God moving in power doing Miracles healing people became popular through her praise God and that's what we want
7:08
we that's that equals Jesus becoming more famous the true Jesus not the
7:13
lukewarm Jesus the true Jesus becoming more famous more popular that's what we want that's a good thing hallelujah
7:19
hallelujah that's a Promised Land Hallelujah so in this revival seasons are going to change it's going to be the
7:26
same thing it's going to be the same thing so we are in this season now where it's like day of Pentecost time it's
7:33
like there's a small room and um
7:40
with enough space for everyone to come in will you discount
7:46
it because it's not a stadium for example because uh it's not the most
7:53
popular thing yet or something uh so maybe you're seeing it's
8:00
not necessary to come or something um well then you'll miss you miss out on
8:06
being there on this most pre on the most precious moves of God and it's about
8:12
obedience you know those people the the people those of you whose eyes have opened up those of you whose eyes have opened up you are like the disciples
8:18
right now the Disciples of Jesus so will you be the 12 or you will you be the disciples that don't see the value you
8:25
know whether you leave or whe you just are lukewarm about it don't see the
8:33
value you know and so really God is calling everyone who is a part of the survival right now to see the
8:39
preciousness of it and to support it it's about supporting the move and also
8:46
understanding that he's calling you to be a powerful vessel of
8:51
God in this revival but the only way you can be a powerful vessel of God is being
8:56
all in is being fully equipped is putting being
9:02
equipped first being equipped and serving so being equipped and giving back to where you're being equipped
9:09
doing everything you can to be equipped to receive impartation to grow that is the only way you can be a
9:15
powerful vessel of God that's the only way you can be whom God is calling you to be it's part of picking up your cross
9:21
is to make that sacrifice it's sacrifice sometimes you know so that's a word I
9:27
have that every event that you are able to get to come treat it as the day of
9:35
Pentecost treat it as not optional obedience to
9:41
God in in two aspects for you to be equipped and receive impartation God
9:46
knows what you need and he is going to release something you need there you may not know what it is but he is going to
9:52
release something you need there and number two supporting it's a part of supporting
9:59
it's a part of being all in it's a part of whether you come there to serve that's a part of it or even if you're
10:06
not coming to serve but you're you're coming to receive and and to support to be a part and support and say yes I must
10:12
be here I must be here on this day of Pentecost because God's called me to be here period and then you get to be
10:19
blessed and receive but it you know you need to carry that in your heart because some people may think in their heart oh
10:25
I can receive from home oh I re you know maybe it's not for me to go it's not just about receiving it's about being
10:32
obedient and supporting God's work what he's doing his move amen hallelujah it's about
10:40
standing standing firm standing passionately Hallelujah I'm so excited
10:46
for flourish jalis I'm so excited and prophetically the the the biggest events
10:53
for the most part have been in Texas there's been the most hunger in that state the um just in history of the past
11:00
few years of me ministering I've ministered in Texas more than any other state because that's where most
11:05
invitations were coming from hunger and so this this conference I am so
11:14
expectant because of the hunger because of the seeds that have been planted there I don't even know how many times I
11:19
ministered there some one of you can tell me probably who lives in Texas I think it's like it's more than 10 I think times over the past few years in
11:26
the teens maybe so I I am so expectant and I I really it's my heart that
11:33
everyone in America and Canada and other places all of you come but like like
11:39
especially like like if because it's in America I I just I believe in my heart that if you're able to you know this is
11:46
not going to be like it's different for everybody it's not going to be like you know you need to sell your house to come
11:53
like I don't mean I'm not saying like God is saying everyone has to be there I'm not like saying that but I'm saying
12:00
if you are able to and it may mean making a sacrifice God wants you there if you are
12:07
if you live in America if you're able to if that's something that you can do like
12:14
fin in terms of travel financially and all of that you know amen and we will be live streaming so if you can't be there
12:20
in person you can watch online and receive and be a part and support amen
12:27
hallelujah how do we make it through parenting rebellious teenage years and not grieve but have joy when I was a
12:35
teenager I made mistakes I was lukewarm and I didn't become lukewarm until I
12:40
became a teenager and I had wrong influences I had um I dated someone who was as an atheist and that was really a
12:49
a a big Open Door in terms of um leading me asay and I did things i i w I regret
12:56
that if I had known what I know now about God's love about God's power about the spiritual realm I never would have
13:02
done um but look how I turned out look at God's grace upon my life praise God
13:08
so I just want to say like my parents were my parents were amazing Believers
13:14
and their parents were Believers too and um honestly I opened up doors but I
13:19
didn't get there was one thing I remember I met with my spiritual father and he he said that there he saw
13:26
prophetically this was like the first year I think in him becoming my spiritual father but one time when I
13:31
went to Tanzania he said he said he saw spiritually that there was an attachment
13:37
that a man had put on me and um in the spiritual realm like an attachment like
13:43
a manipulative like attachment like he had put that and he removed it my spiritual father removed it by God's
13:49
power and when he spoke that it made so much sense because I remember um that even when I was being lukewarm for a
13:56
time for the most of the time of me being lukewarm I still loved God and I still didn't want to compromise in many
14:02
areas and I had made like these decisions especially as time went on and I got was
14:09
starting to get out of the lukewarm phase as much you know growing into like college age coming back to God
14:16
more um well I didn't even know how to have a relationship with God at that point so I was starting to learn how to have a relationship with God and
14:22
everything and but I remember there's this one guy where it was like this control that I it it was looking back it
14:29
was like a spell and I could never figure that out um and so anyways it made so much
14:37
sense when when he said that and so but besides that besides that I had
14:44
opened up doors but I didn't get demons so it's not always that when you open a
14:50
door immediately a demon comes in but I had opened up doors in
14:56
different in different aspects of sin like with drinking and with guys and
15:01
everything in um my when I was around like 16 17 age especially but then other
15:08
you know others they've opened a door and they get oppression it's it's different but a lot of it can have to do
15:14
with seeds that were planted I know you know when you are planted where the anointing is there is a great power of
15:21
God that is working on your children's behalf that is touching them is
15:26
protecting them my parents I know that their faith I know that there was a a a
15:33
different kind of protection there's a different kind of protection upon my life I mean I didn't open up a door just one time in my
15:39
teenage years you know several times but I didn't get and even I remember like liking to drink but it wasn't like an
15:47
addiction I remember there was a time I felt my carnal My Flesh like Desiring to
15:52
drink you know but it looking back it wasn't like an addiction like I see that special protection over me that even
15:59
when I went through that phase and I know it's because of my parents it's it's what you sow you reap and so they
16:07
had swed so many good seeds and even my grandparents they had swed so many good seeds so there's a special kind of
16:12
protection upon my life and also God knew my plan my purpose for my life as well if you are surrendered to God and
16:21
and in in in his anointing in his Revival then the plan on your life is so
16:27
big and the plan on your children's life therefore is so big to be a an anointed
16:32
vessel of God similar to me not saying your calling is my exact calling I don't mean that I don't mean that but I mean
16:38
like you are so precious and your children are so precious to God you know you're different you're special
16:45
so carry that peace in your heart because Free Will is a real thing like I had Free Will and that's why I opened up
16:52
doors and I'm glad that my parents like let me have free will because I I think I would have been rebellious
16:59
or something maybe um if they had been forceful on me but that being said it's
17:05
very important parents that you do put up boundaries so like for example if
17:11
your child doesn't want to come to church if they're under 18 bring them to church of I mean if they have Demons of
17:18
course they don't want to come to church um you know that's there's going to be certain parts of and I had to go to
17:25
church I went to church every single Sunday with my parents you know bring them to church there's going to be
17:30
certain things where you know someone may be a very very bad influence and this is actually dangerous for your child put that boundary up unashamedly
17:38
but explain to them from your heart why this is what this is not just you lording rules over them explain like the
17:43
reasons why yes give your your child somewhat free will but you you need to
17:49
understand that until they're 18 they're a child still and it's important that you do your part as a parent uh to help
17:58
them you you know even bringing them to church if they don't want to be there that anointing can just come and touch
18:03
them I remember one time um and I there's a testimony of this on my YouTube this teenage boy he didn't want
18:10
to come to church he just wanted to stay in his room but his mom brought him told
18:16
him he had to come and I started praying for the whole family and as I start praying for the whole family just
18:22
declaring all of a sudden he starts shaking and I asked him do you want to
18:28
re announce anything and he he starts to renounce so he goes from not even wanting to come to now the power of God's going over him so the fear of
18:34
God's coming and he's encountering God's love and it's making him to change
18:39
fast and he he renounces and the power of God pushes them to the ground he's
18:45
delivered and then his eyes open up he takes off his glasses he can see now and
18:51
then he testifies after the service that he has this whole Encounter With Jesus where Jesus brought him to heaven and Jesus spoke to him and Jesus was
18:58
speaking these scriptures to him and he recites these scriptures and he's you can tell he wasn't a person that was interested in God before now he's
19:04
reciting scriptures and passionately speaking about God hallelujah so that's the power of just bringing your kid to
19:12
where the power of God is um so you should unashamedly bring your kid to church it's not torture to come to
19:18
church in fact the real church is Lively exciting
19:23
beautiful Hallelujah but um yeah so in regard to the question rest in God trust
19:30
in him call your spiritual children your I mean sorry your children call them
19:35
into the kingdom you know say this anointing that pray like this this anointing that I have that I'm receiving
19:42
this anointing the words that were declared the words that were declared this Sunday these words that were declared may they go to my son and my
19:50
daughter now may they receive this anointing I am receiving may they receive it in their lives
19:57
now pray those types of Godly prayers that access that
20:03
anointing that you are receiving and releasing it to them amen and then
20:09
lastly show them the love of God the kindness of God leads to repentance so that's what I meant when I'm like I'm
20:14
glad that my parents weren't like mean and lording like tons of rules over me
20:20
um because I think that would have made me not come back as as quickly you know
20:29
so it's important to just really be loving with the love of God because the
20:35
kindness of God leads to repentance and when you do put those you have to you do have to you know be strict and put
20:42
boundaries and rules up for sure as a parent that's very important but as you do that um you know be firm but at the
20:50
same time explain to them like this is why and maybe when they come to when they're not so maybe if they're really
20:56
upset or whatever but when they like calm down you can talk to them with love like explain to them this is the reason
21:02
why you know it's not that I don't want you to have fun or
21:08
whatever how do we know what video God wants us to hear and
21:13
apply you have a lot of videos that are so needed in our lives to apply and so much we can watch but how do we know
21:20
which video God wants well first of all the current videos like the current
21:27
Sunday teachings and like midweek teachings and
21:33
q&as you can know for sure that those ones for sure God wants you to receive
21:39
that week they're prophetic it I I do not have a curriculum plan like I it is
21:46
Holy spirit-led every week the teachings that I that I teach it would be a lot
21:52
easier for me to just make up a plan can I teach this this week this week you know sometimes it takes so
22:00
much so much energy and time just to like just to to seek God for the the
22:09
word he wants you to hear that week so you can know that the words coming forth
22:15
this week God for sure wants you to know them this week to hear them this week so
22:21
I would say first of all don't take them lightly listen to them more than one
22:26
time take notes meditate on them um and that will take a lot of time
22:33
you don't have to feel like every single day you have to listen to a different video sometimes it may be good to really
22:41
spend time really getting that those words of the week in you make that
22:48
priority to listen multiple times to really meditate on that but then there
22:53
will be some times where you have more time and you you feel led by the holy SP Spirit to listen to another video or
23:00
more than one video from the past there are so many from the past and some of you who are new you'd actually do need
23:06
to catch up a lot I have my Revival army training playlist that's a lot of very important foundational new wine
23:15
teachings so those are very important to really listen to several times and
23:21
really understand get into you apply so like if you're new on the newer side
23:27
like here within less than a year at least even more I mean there's so many topics very
23:34
important topics that I've taught last year that I have not taught again this year you know if you if you've only been
23:40
planted here for a year it's very important you really go back before you came especially that like year before
23:48
you came and look at those titles look at those like oh this seems like very
23:53
new like I haven't heard this yet cuz there's there's a lot that I haven't like repeated because because there's so
23:59
many new things that the Lord leads me to share amen um there's been disciples
24:06
that have been here for about four years now so there's people at
24:12
every walk you know babies to more
24:19
mature so depending like where you are really depends as well if you need to
24:25
catch up a lot more than you then you do need to make more time to listen to more videos especially from the past but um
24:34
you don't need to feel like so like what do I need to listen to honestly like it's like the Bible like it's not always
24:41
going to be like what should I read now like sometimes it's I mean the whole Bible is
24:48
good you can't go wrong so sometimes it's God's so God's so much more simple
24:53
than we make him out to be like sometimes it's just like what do you want to read what what what do you feel
25:00
to read today like it's all good you need to know it all you need to get all of it in you yeah so you don't need to
25:07
feel like what video must I listen to you you need them all and I feel that way every time I preach I preach like I
25:15
preach with that conviction knowing like the people need this word I never preach
25:20
like oh this word's not as important as like last week's word or next week's
25:26
word I never sense that that from God when I preach I always preach with that conviction that this word is desperately
25:34
needed so you can't go wrong you you you you need all of them you're going to be
25:41
really fed with all of them and you know it's like and the teachings are like the Bible in terms of like the Bible we're
25:47
never going to stop reading it we're not going to be like okay we're aged 60 we're age 70 now we've read the Bible millions of times now I can spend my
25:54
time doing something differently it's alive and so God's still speaking on the word and so these
26:01
teachings that I'm teaching God speaks different things like he'll open up your eyes to different things to I mean more
26:08
Revelations will come as you listen to them does believing that something bad will happen to
26:14
you um especially when it caused by past trauma and open door to the enemy since that's something I've been struggling
26:19
with well what's very important is for you to realize you have the choice you really have the choice believing is a
26:26
choice so once your eyes are opened up you know you've
26:31
recognized the enemy wants me to believe this lie that something bad will happen
26:37
to me you need to your eyes have opened up this is what's going on while I am
26:44
making the choice I have free will I have dominion over the devil I am
26:50
choosing to reject that lie as much as you feel it in your
26:57
emotions it can feel like truth it's so strong you have the choice your eyes are opened
27:03
up you have the choice I reject those lies I choose to believe God's word he
27:09
knows the plans he has for me plans to prosper me not to harm me but to give me hope and a
27:15
future I will not believe what the devil is speaking about my future I choose to
27:23
not believe it I do not believe it I believe my future is protected is
27:29
beautiful is covered by God's grace protection love he's made beautiful
27:36
plans for me my future is great
27:42
period if you do that with your words you take the action with your
27:48
words just do what I just did in the spiritual realm is counted that's counted as Faith that's counted
27:55
as you are believing God's word even if your feelings aren't caught up
28:01
yet even if your feelings feel afraid still you have to keep doing it keep
28:07
rejecting it if you still feel the feelings of fear keep rejecting it keep declaring what you believe is true it's
28:13
a law in the spiritual realm that the devil has to flee those feelings will dissipate submit to God resist the devil
28:20
and he must flee so um you have the choice you have the choice you have the
28:26
power you have victory Devil's defeated Hallelujah can you
28:31
please explain what Mercy means like his mercies are new Every Morning Mercy is very similar to Grace So Mercy is just
28:40
Jesus having Mercy on us H you know having compassion for us
28:47
um having understanding you know he came as a man and so he's he's he's
28:55
dealt with the things that we've dealt with he he he understands the spiritual war he understands the spiritual
29:02
Temptations so when we sin he's able to really in his heart
29:09
understand and have compassion rather than just um punish us and that's it you
29:17
know instead he has mercy so he gives Grace So Grace is
29:23
undeserved favor it's un undeserved like
29:29
I'm pardoning you I'm I will not I'm not going to punish you for this I'm going to remove the sin
29:36
and forgive you that's Grace and so we receive his grace because of the mercy
29:43
he has for us because he sees us and he and he's says I love you so much I have
29:51
compassion I'm going to show you Mercy give you Grace so it's very similar to
29:56
Grace so his Grace is new Every Morning The Merc his mercies are new Every
30:02
Morning meaning he meaning he has so much of it it doesn't run
30:09
out you know he has so much of it it just does not run out it he doesn't come to a point where he's like I'm sick of
30:17
handing out this Grace again he has so much of it it's never ending I received healing a couple
30:23
months ago at church and have been declaring that I am healed but still haven't seen the full
30:30
manifestation do I keep declaring and waiting so first of all I'm going to say
30:35
watch my video which is on the Revival army training playlist how to receive complete deliverance you might have already seen that but I would say to
30:41
watch it again and to really watch it with an open heart to hear the Holy Spirit he may be
30:47
speaking this do more of this you know guiding you directing you but as a
30:53
general answer the time that God releases the miracle holy is so different for
31:01
everybody um the full manifestation of the healing some it's immediate some
31:07
receive some Miracles immediately but then other healings they don't see happen immediately and some can be like
31:13
it can be like an even bigger healing or Deliverance happens immediately but like
31:18
the more minor one isn't happening immediately a lot of that's having to do so much of the time is just a mystery of
31:26
God sometimes it's God has a purpose in this sometimes he uses that as a way to build faith is you know almost similarly
31:34
to the delay of the promise the delay of the promise the delay of the promise
31:40
like even in my life patience has grown in me faith has
31:47
grown in Me by really believing that God wanted something to happen now for his
31:54
purposes for his glory in my life the promises but it not happening and it not
32:02
happening a year later and it not happening a year after that and it not happening a year after that but guess what every time it's like
32:11
every time I was I had that choice to trust God and Trust his goodness and
32:17
Trust his faithfulness and humble myself to know that his ways are higher and he
32:23
knows more and I'm just creation and I don't get I don't understand but he's
32:30
he's he's in control he knows best like anytime that you have to do that like
32:36
you have to make that choice to believe that way or not like when you choose to believe that way when you choose to
32:42
believe God just to keep going just to persevere just to keep trusting keep
32:48
believing keep praising him not being bitter not complaining keep being patient in your
32:54
actions maybe not your emotions but your actions and your words but every time you keep doing that you
33:02
grow you transform more into God's image patience grows you may feel impatient
33:09
every day so it may feel like you're not being patient or patience isn't growing
33:14
but if you will if you will choose to be patient like choose to not complain
33:21
choose to keep beli in God choose to keep serving him choose to not doubt
33:26
him honestly patience is being built in you patience is truly being built and
33:32
someday you'll see it someday and faith is is being built and so someday you'll see it someday you'll find like whoa
33:39
like I'm unbothered that this isn't happening yet when back then that would be really
33:46
uncomfortable you know and so that that's a that's a big reason behind a lot of people not seeing the complete
33:53
manifestation of healing immediately is that God is using it to to build these
33:59
things in the heart to build this faith and patience and trust in
34:06
him amen sometimes it also has to do with him wanting you to keep keep seeking him
34:13
keep um to just not have like arrived but
34:19
just having a need for him you
34:24
know but I declare that this healing complete healing must come in Jesus
34:33
name amen how do we overcome fear of
34:40
man you got to get fear of God deeper in you doesn't really come naturally most
34:46
of the time but you know you can't have fear of man and fear of God where you
34:52
can have a little bit of fear of God and more fear of man and fear of man outweighs so the way to get rid of fear
34:57
of man is to have more fear of God to have only fear of God and honestly it's quite as simple as this if I do this
35:05
this is in Disobedience to God I can't do this this is how I live my life it's
35:11
very simple it's like if I do this if I do
35:16
this because I want to please somebody or something or because I care what people think d da so I'm doing this that
35:23
therefore means I am disobeying God I would be displeasing God so I obviously
35:30
can't do that like that it's very simple like I
35:38
just I feel like my life when it comes to these things like fear of man how do
35:43
you overcome it and how do you obey God is it's really simple to Me Mary Mary
35:49
she she when the angel came um and said you know this wild
35:57
prophecy Wild's announcement holy spirit is going to
36:03
impregnate you and you're going to carry in your womb the Messiah and Mary you know she asked like
36:10
how can this be you know just real quick but then once she gets a little understanding clarification a little bit
36:16
uh from the angel she then goes let it be done to me as you said
36:21
for I a servant of the Lord so simple it's so it's just simp
36:27
it's just Mary just simply knew I'm a servant of the Lord I have to obey God
36:32
period not I have to obey God cuz like a robot but I love God and he's my Lord
36:41
and he's my master and I'm his servant I've made a commitment to him
36:46
I've made a covenant to him and so here this you know God saying I'm calling you
36:51
to do this so it's like okay Lord no fighting no debating no praying praying
36:57
about it no um debating in your mind no asking a poll asking people what they
37:04
think no is this a wise decision like God asked you do
37:11
it um and that's that's like my story I relate to much so much to Mary like with
37:17
the the prophecy coming from my spiritual father you're called me an apostle of Jesus Christ you're called to
37:22
reach the Nations all that okay God it it was there was no
37:27
praying about it there was no debating there was no thinking it over there was no um talking with friends and family
37:36
because God spoke this and it was clear as day it was not like I think I heard God's voice maybe like in that moment
37:44
God had spoken it and there's a lot of things in life where you don't need to pray about it you know what's right or
37:49
what's wrong you know you know that this is fearing man to do this so um you know
37:58
so that's that's that's my my secret my secret of like being in God's Will
38:05
and being um bold and courageous and
38:11
strong I am a servant of the Lord I I have to obey him like it just Grieves my heart so much to displease God and it
38:19
should grieve all of our hearts like if it's not grieving your heart you need
38:24
to you need to meditate on who God is more like
38:31
teachings that I've shared about God's love meditate on how amazing his love is for you that he's worthy of surrender that
38:38
he's worthy to be served that he's worthy to obey
38:44
completely so get that in your heart more get fear of God in your heart more
38:49
that it shouldn't be optional it shouldn't be optional to to serve God
38:55
like it should gross us out so much to fear man like to do something to for
39:02
approval of people or because you're afraid of what people think that should that should just be like such a huge no
39:08
no way I can do that I have to obey God Amen you can do it that's the other
39:14
thing is too just like believing that God will give you the strength believing God will protect you when you are in God's
39:21
will that's the safest place to be so there's no need to fear people when you're in God's will that's the safest
39:26
place you can be so sure people will reject you but that's that means you're
39:32
on the right track so yeah people will reject you absolutely but God's hand
39:38
will be with you so I would rather have um nobody endorsed me but God be with me
39:46
God's hand be with me God opened up doors no man can shut then having
39:52
everybody like me and having everyone approve me and endorse me and God not be
39:57
with me I would rather have God be with me and have no approval of
40:05
people amen hallelujah so you just really need to think on that you know
40:10
meditate meditate on these truths I would if you struggle with that I would go back and just simply watch what I
40:17
shared because it's just really simple it's very simple so to get these truths in you that we are a servant of God that
40:25
it's not worth it to disob obey God to just get that word in you that's
40:31
going to help you amen well I want to declare over all of you right now those of you that have
