Intro
0:00
can you explain more about spiritual generals or more on the spiritual government yeah I have um a couple
0:07
messages on my YouTube one of them is definitely on the Revival
0:13
army training playlist and that one I really go like way into depth about that
0:19
topic so definitely watch that after this message because that's I could go on for
0:25
a good hour and a half right now it's a very important topic a very important topic that a lot of people don't know
0:31
about in the body of Christ just to share a little bit right now uh so we we I
0:38
started I was talking about this a little about in the live a couple days ago we are in a kingdom government
0:43
uh we are in the kingdom of God so Kingdom has the meaning of government
0:48
basically and a lot of people in the body of Christ a lot of Christians don't realize that don't realize that we're
0:54
really in a kingdom don't realize really what that means and so Ephesians 4 11 talks about how
What are the gifts given to the body
1:02
there's gifts given to the body of Christ that Jesus gave and they are Apostles prophets evangelists pastors
1:07
and teachers and the purpose is to equip the body for works of service these
1:14
offices are going to be carrying higher levels of anointing and Authority in the
1:19
Kingdom kind of like how the teacher must know more must have like more experience must
1:26
more no no more so that they can actually pour more into the student so
1:32
the student can actually grow you don't want the teacher on the same level as the student the student would not grow
1:37
right so that's how it needs to be the the the the the the true anointed
1:42
five-fold ministers must have a greater anointing and greater Authority so that they can pour into
1:49
and lift up and the body of Christ the disciples
1:54
um and so that even those disciples that are called to to you know Elijah to Elisha's they're called to do the same
2:01
things and greater sometimes sometimes they're called to be faithful ministers um well they need to make sure they're
2:08
getting high level training high level anointing and when it comes to
How do you cast out demons
2:15
the casting out of demons there's there's principalities there's high level demons with high level demonic
2:22
power and not all Christians can cast out those
2:28
demons we need to go the kingdom way there are certain people in the body of
2:34
Christ certain um like five full ministers that have this
2:39
higher anointing and authority to deal with those highest level principalities
2:44
and that's the secret one of the secrets of why Peter and Paul it's when they
2:49
were ministering all were healed all were free the reason being is because
2:54
no demonic power could stay even the highest level demonic Powers had to go
3:00
because of the level in the Kingdom they were at the level of authority the higher level
3:06
that's why it was with so much ease that they were going there wasn't a struggle and there wasn't like oh well
3:12
everyone was freed except for this person no all were freed all principalities had to go
Where to get anointing and equipping
3:20
so uh it's supposed to be you where the whole body of Christ would recognize
3:26
this Kingdom government would recognize the peters and the Pauls in the body of
3:32
Christ the ones that according to God's perfect purposes has placed at that high
3:37
level of authority and anointing um the body of Christ should realize
3:43
this so they know okay this is where to get equipping number one and also where
3:49
to get impartation and also this is really where we should bring
3:56
those people with the highest level demonic uh cases
4:01
you know we should have that Kingdom mindset rather than just like I can do
4:07
everything I have the Holy Spirit in me so bring me any kind of person with any
4:12
demonic problem and they must go that's not really being spiritual being
4:17
spiritual is having that kingdom of God mindset Kingdom government
4:23
mindset and a lot of people even now are being kept in bondage simply
4:30
because maybe like leaders and churches won't recognize maybe out of jealousy or
4:36
um just ignorance maybe not realizing how this Kingdom government works but like if they could simply say
4:44
you know go to this to higher level anointing so that this
4:49
high level demonic case can be broken and destroyed
5:00
when you look at the book of Acts you see such unity and such an understanding of the kingdom of God
5:07
um you don't see like my Ministry and my Ministry and my you don't see this like separation and we're
5:14
doing everything that you need here and we don't need anyone else you don't you
5:20
don't see that in the book of Acts you see this Unity you see this Unity among the apostles among the other ministers
5:26
among the other faithful ministers and that's how it should be today that
Different levels of anointing
5:31
we recognize the different giftings the different levels of anointing the generals or the
5:39
different um higher levels of anointing and Authority in the body of Christ
5:44
and honor them and work together and spread the news to others
5:50
you know this is how God is moving in great power right now through this
5:55
vessel of God in this ministry this is where high level demonic Powers have to go because the anointing is at a high
6:02
level here goal there you know and um also like in this revival
6:11
a big part of um the the body of Christ being transformed and purified it's
6:17
gonna it's going to come through uh small amount of like like
6:23
spearheading pioneer generals uh with high level anointing you know
6:29
similar to like Peter and Peter and Paul
6:35
where real like leaders that are called to re that God
6:40
is releasing this Revelation to as an example of the body of Christ so to so
6:46
people should come and learn receive impartation
6:52
that's how really so much transformation will come when this when it's accepted when God's way is accepted when God's
6:59
weak and foolish vessels that he's raised up and poured out Mighty anointing in are accepted
7:06
so and accepting just means so that they can actually just do their job and pour
7:11
out accepted to be able to pour out to pour out to others
7:16
accepted so that others can actually receive I deal with extreme gossip at University
7:21
and they keep trying to get me to participate I can't really leave but I really don't want to hear it what do I do
7:28
have a smaller group of close friends have a have a I mean even if it's just
Small group of close friends
7:34
one that has a pure heart that will not be gossiping that will not be a
7:40
distraction from the thing from God and won't be an Open Door and then of course when you're in class
7:47
when you're in certain situations that you can't control that you have to be there with people among people you
7:54
can't you can't do anything about it you can't just storm out and leave you know but you just have to
8:00
um not participate not to not participate in that gossip just be quiet and don't participate but when it comes
8:06
to friend groups you can do something about it when it comes to friend groups if people are gossiping so much then
8:12
that's just telling you right now that they're not called to be in your close group of friends inner circle group of
8:18
friends is listening to music not created for God and open door like if the lyrics
8:23
aren't worldly and it's talking about things that aren't honoring to the devil
Should you listen to inspirational music
8:31
okay so I think you're asking if it's like if the lyrics are kind of like inspiring like this could be innocent
8:37
love there's most songs are about love and it could just be innocently talking about love
8:42
um it could be inspirational songs um those song those songs are fine you know
8:48
if they're not explicitly made for God they're fine but it just it kind of it
8:53
just depends on the person and it depends on how much you're listening to it so
8:59
I would say I wouldn't spend all day listening to that music because your
9:04
eyes and your ears are open doors and so what you put in
9:09
goes in you know um that's not to say like we you should
9:15
only be reading the Bible 24 7 and watching only Godly shows and
9:21
um Christian shows and Christian music on 24 7 like I don't mean that but I
9:27
just mean like the majority of your day you should be inputting Godly things the majority of
9:33
your day like when you have spare time to watch something listen to something
9:41
um and read Let It Be majority Godly uh things of
9:47
God and then part of the day could be listening to music that's inspirational not death not
9:56
um glorifying the devil or worldly things not that that's going to be poisonous to you but if it's like
10:02
neutral you know that's okay to have it um some of it you know just not too much
10:11
because then it could be taking up time when you're supposed to be feeling yourself with the
10:17
things of God with the word of God so that's what I mean it just like depends on the person it depends on how much you
10:23
listen to but in general it's okay I'm involved in the entertainment acting industry since 2019 as background actor
10:30
and have been studying more of the craft since last year to get into commercial roles can God still use me
10:36
and healing and deliverance God can use anybody in any area of work they do
God can use anybody
10:42
unless they are doing something uh that's just
10:48
opening the door up to the devil so much you know like their job is um
10:54
I don't know like in their job they're doing really unethical things is what I'm trying to say you know
11:00
really immoral things in their job but otherwise we are called to
11:05
be um in this world but not of this world right so we are called to go into
11:13
different areas of the workplace all different spheres and be the light
11:19
in the darkness we are not all called imagine if we all just worked in the church we all just worked in Ministry
11:26
how would the loss be reached that's why so many of so many people you
11:32
need you need to realize like just be patient where you're at and don't be picky about jobs and you know I
11:39
know that you're not where you want to be you don't want to be doing this job but God has other plans for right now
11:45
God wants to use you be to to be the salt and light in this earth and that requires
11:51
being among people in the world sometimes it's not comfortable but how else would it be saved how else would
11:57
they know Jesus how else would the world get to know the good news right so
12:04
um yeah you should never feel like oh I have a job that's not in Ministry and so
12:10
I feel guilty no no no no no this is actually God's calling for so many people is you do have regular normal
12:16
jobs among people in the world that's actually what God wants a lot of people to do to be the light and salt in the
12:23
Earth um and and then God is going to be using you to minister to people God's going to
12:31
be using you to talk about him to share testimonies in the workplace where you're at and God's going to be
12:39
using you in certain relationships or through certain conversations that come up maybe somebody starts to be talking
12:44
to you during the lunch break about how they are really struggling with anxiety they've been having panic attacks all
12:50
the time and they couldn't even go to work yesterday because of the panic attack you know they just start talking
12:56
to you and they're opening up to you and then that that leads you to share you know I've actually been delivered from
13:01
anxiety or maybe you haven't been delivered from anxiety but you've been delivered from other things and you know you've seen many testimonies of people
13:07
being delivered from anxiety and panic attacks and you start sharing with them maybe you're like look at this video of
13:13
this person that was delivered this is this is real this is what Jesus Does you know and you just start telling them
13:19
about Jesus how he is the ultimate healer and deliver how he can take it
13:24
all away that his love is that amazing for him or her and then maybe it just
13:31
ends there that that day or maybe that person really opens up and uh there's an opportunity to pray for
13:39
them because they're open and you pray for them and God uses you to in healing and deliverance right
13:45
there the person is healed the person is delivered right on the lunch break you know that's how
13:50
God wants to be using so many people in the day today where they are in in work
13:57
clarification Christians who are saved can't be demon-possessed but be delivered out from oppression and
Clarification
14:03
demonic strongholds the problem is is with the English language and culture and
14:09
um I mean there's confusion there's confusion when it comes to this so much in the body of Christ when it really should just be something so simple but
14:15
there's been so much confusion um religion has brought confusion and
14:21
society and how they Define demons and demonic possession and the Hollywood
14:26
movies so when a person hears the word demonic possession most people think of those creepy
14:36
um horror movies with a person looking really creepy
14:42
right their eyes really creepy their hair in their face
14:47
just really creepy not you know not human
14:53
um like they look like a demon instead of a demon-possessed person even that's what most people think so that's culture
14:59
that's language that's that's what most people think of demonic
15:04
possession now in the Bible it so many times is talking about demonic possession demonic
15:11
possession demonic possessions kind of just simply simply not being like well
15:16
there's oppression and there's possession you don't see this like complication of language and so uh
15:23
really what God is called is calling me to do is to
15:29
simplify his message there's religion is complicated things so much and to just
15:36
really present him and his gospel his kingdom in a way that's not complicated that's
15:43
not it's just simple the book and really understand it you know what I mean and so um
15:50
the fact is is that there are Christians and non-christians who have demons and
15:58
there's a difference because a Christian who's really a Christian has the Holy Spirit
16:05
that's the difference and the Holy Spirit so they know God's love and they're having intimacy and
16:10
communion with God but they still have a demonic yoke that is keeping them from knowing the fullness of god that's
16:16
literally keeping them stuck and even though they have the Holy Spirit they are literally stuck with this Yoke the
16:24
same way that a person who's not a Christian is stuck with a yoke and the demon is inside it's not a demon
16:30
outwardly oppressing them the demon is inside when a Christian like has
16:36
addiction has anxiety has depression that's a demon inside
16:42
and all you have to do is just come to a church a service of faithful church or
16:48
watch one one time we're going to Revival sound surface and you'll you can clearly see demons are within why
16:54
because when the anointing starts to pour upon people you see
17:00
these manifestations where many times you can truly see the demon is within the demon literally overtakes the person
17:07
many times I mean many times the person kind of goes unconscious the person the
17:12
the demon will even like take over the person's eyes where I I've seen before I have videos I have videos
17:19
of uh of eyes that like a gentleman's eyes when he was looking at when the
17:24
demon was looking at me within the guy the guy's eyes went in the back of his
17:30
head that was wild I'll never forget that you like couldn't see like where my blue
17:35
parts are the blue part of my eye like the iris and the people whatever it was like way back
17:42
and it's like you could only see the white and I was just looking at these eyes and I was commanding demon to go
17:48
and as I commanded the demon to go you slowly saw the the eye come back down
17:54
until the person was like normal it was free so that's obviously a demon within
17:59
and that's obviously a demon literally possessing the person at that moment I mean possessing just means like taking
18:05
over so that demon was taking over the person's eye um also so many times
18:11
at fivefold church at Revival without service she says you'll see when the anointing comes upon people and those
18:17
demons like they become manifest they manifest what's hiding within manifests and they overtake a person's mouth they
18:23
overtake a person's body so so many times I've seen demons like overtake the person's eyes overtake like the look
18:30
they'll be looking at me like this you know like like this like that's not the person but the pr the demon is like
18:35
looking like this towards me really or really like trying to intimidate me like
18:41
like really scary looking and then um then they'll still talk I'm so many
18:47
times you'll hear literally the demons say I'm trying to kill this person or I hate you they'll say to me or I'm I
18:55
don't I didn't want her to come like the person that the Demon's in I didn't want her to come here and I don't want to
19:01
leave her I don't want to go um yeah so many different things and then also you hear them scream this
19:08
blood curdling scream that many times like a real human couldn't do really or they'd have to try like the hardest
19:14
they've ever tried to scream you know okay so that's obviously possessing the
19:19
person at that time um with the body you see people you see
19:24
like I'm like come here many times I say to the demon in the person come here and the
19:30
like the demons literally possessing the person so they literally can't even move
19:35
forward and sometimes I'll come in I'm like you demon that's trying to keep that person from coming towards me and
19:40
you from coming towards me so I can deal with you you in this person come so I'm
19:46
speaking to the demon in the person so that demon is obviously possessing that person at the time technically right I
19:52
mean possession just means like take over um so the thing is though is that when a
19:59
Christian has a demon and Christensen obviously have demons I have a whole message on this on my
Demons in Christians
20:04
YouTube please watch it for more context more teaching um I think it's just called like
20:09
Christian Christians have demons on my YouTube uh but they obviously can have
20:15
demons and that's just simply because when a door is open the Bible talks about do not give give a foothold to the
20:21
devil so when a door is opened a demon can come in that the Bible gives
20:26
us that warning when if a Christian follows the word of God really with the Holy Spirit not religiously but really
20:34
has understanding of the word of God they're surrendered to God and they follow God's world perfectly they will not open up a door and they will never
20:40
get a demon now it it's very important for parents to
20:48
close doors and to not open doors for their children if they're opening doors for their children which could include
20:54
like um dating somebody who's an abuser who who Who's like
21:00
not of God right and then they date that person and that person ends up abusing
21:06
their child and then that child gets a demon because there's a door open because the parent had Authority in the
21:12
spirit realm over that child they were called to protect them until they were able to protect themselves spiritually physically and spiritually and that
21:20
parent opened the door for the child and the child got a demon from abuse that happened you know
21:27
um so that child so that child could live an amazing Christian Life all of the word god perfectly and they could still have a demon and then there's
21:33
generational curses um people can do for example Witchcraft and past Generations be doing witchcraft
21:40
and that can be have there can be a reaping that is put upon the children so
21:46
they're they're sowing such evil that it's literally translating and having an effect on the future Generations
21:54
uh so these are all the different ways demons can come in Christians
22:00
um so I think a lot of people have a hard time hearing that Christians can have demons because they're like well
22:05
God would never allow that it no we are given Free Will and so we have to choose to keep doors shut and we need to take
22:13
it seriously being parents of children that our children are a responsibility
22:19
when they're young they could get demons because we opened the door this is just a reality you know
22:26
um so that's how it can happen doors can open up uh but Jesus can free you by the
22:33
power of the anointing if the anointing is just there you can be free so a lot of people have a problem with this because they just
22:39
think how could Christians have demons well addiction is a demon if you open up
22:45
the door to do drugs and alcohol whether you're Christian or not you're going to get demons either way probably you're going to get the addiction either either
22:51
way right so it's as simple as that and the same is true for anxiety for depression for
22:58
impure sexual spirits that bring sex dreams and and things like this and
Demons from within
23:06
all sorts of things so Christians can have demons and it's not demons just oppressing from the
23:12
outside but it is demons from within and so um the difference though is that
23:18
they're like hiding and they're not possessing the person like possessing the person on the day today
23:24
but the person is being influenced by those demons uh you know if it's a demon of rage or anger
23:31
the demon is kind of pretty much possessing the person at certain points like if if if if somebody does something
23:38
mean to you and you have a demon of rage or anger maybe you're a Christian and you really
23:44
want to just turn the other cheek and love your enemies and and just be silent and not lash out but because you have a
23:52
demon the demon has control over you in that area and will possess you in that moment will
23:58
overtake you in the moment so people don't like to hear the word possess overtake whatever you know but um I just
24:05
see so much of these like um tiptoeing around and arguments and it's like
24:12
let's just keep it simple you can have a demon and so it doesn't matter the language a Christians can have a demon
24:18
and it's from within but Jesus can free you and get it out hallelujah hallelujah
24:27
how do we answer people who try to insinuate that we're too demon focused and try to say there's more to God than
24:33
that um well the devil is our enemy and this and this
24:40
Earth and we are fighting a spiritual war um we are in a war every day and we have
24:46
to be aware that we're in a spiritual war and many people don't realize that demons are so common that demons are
24:53
The Works that the devil sends that's the devil's big way of working
24:59
in people is sending demons and so when people's eyes aren't opened up they hear
25:05
demons and they think horror movies they don't think daily Christian Life
25:11
so a lot of people whose eyes aren't opened will think that um could say that
25:18
people whose eyes are opened up to the truth that demons exist that a lot of Christians have demons they'll think
25:23
you're too demon focused but really their eyes are just not opened up to the prevalence of demons
25:30
um and the other thing is that so many people don't realize that so many Christians have demons so many
25:36
people so many Christians have demonic oppression and this is kind of like
25:41
the equivalence of people just like bleeding in their homes
Demonic oppression
25:49
like imagine if it's it's like if it's like there's an emergency where someone's like bleeding out and you need
25:55
to call 9-1-1 in this home and it's happening under the home over there in a home across history in the apartment
26:00
next door there's someone bleeding out an emergency we need to call 9-1-1 that's like what it's the state of the
26:08
body of Christ right now so many Christians are suffering in demonic oppression unnecessarily this is
26:15
an emergency there's no need for Christians to be carrying demons living with demons having demons influence
26:23
their lives demons ruin their lives being tortured by demons there's no
26:28
reason for that there's no reason for that Jesus Paid the price for the worst the Devils to be
26:34
destroyed for by his stripes you to be healed and set free so
26:41
it's like really saddening when your eyes open up and you realize so many
26:46
Christians have these demons unnecessarily so many Christians are bleeding out in their homes
26:52
unnecessarily we can just call 9-1-1 get the ambulance here
26:57
get them to the hospital get them taken care of and they're going to be fine by tomorrow like you know what I mean like
27:03
in the spiritual realm they just need to come where the anointing is 9-1-1
27:09
hear the truth that this is demonic oppression and you need freedom and you need the anointing to destroy these
27:15
yokes come receive and come receive freedom and healing now get Freedom now and live
27:21
an abundant life now it's really a dire situation in the body
27:27
of Christ right now and the more that your eyes open up like the more that your eyes open up the more you realize
27:34
what a serious situation this is like Christians do not need to be suffering
27:39
with demons get free get healed Hallelujah and so
27:45
that's why right now we are sounding the alarm that's why right now it's Deliverance Deliverance Deliverance it
27:51
is so much Deliverance of faithful church it's been so much Deliverance that every revivalist now have been it's been mostly Deliverance not because
27:57
that's the only place the anointing is strong in or something that's what my
28:02
specific calling is is Deliverance no it's because this is an emergency specifically people are stuck with
28:09
demons all over the body of Christ unnecessarily and by God's grace he has brought Revival he has brought this
28:16
anointing down to this Earth for us he is opening eyes and it's time now to
28:21
call 9-1-1 you know it's time now to get these people free it's time now to sound the
28:28
alarm demons are real these things that you have are demons and they need to go so
28:36
to some people that sounds like we're being demon focused but to me it sounds like we're being love focused it means
28:42
we're being focused on the real emergency they need to be free so many people are not really saved
28:49
because they're not free yet they don't know God's love you know Jesus God talks
28:54
about how I'll spit out the lukewarm I will spit out the lukewarm
28:59
and you know we don't really we we can't really know everyone's salvation we
29:05
can't really know like oh this person they're pretty lukewarm so they probably
29:11
won't be saved like we don't really know but what we do know is that we need to take it so seriously
29:18
our Salvation we need to take it so seriously our surrender to God we don't want to play around with our Salvation we don't want to play around with being
29:25
too lukewarm you know we don't want to play around with God's grace and so most people that have a demon are
29:34
lukewarm because well number one you need to actually meet Jesus and encounter God's
29:40
power like for me before I encountered the anointing which destroys Yokes before I
29:46
encountered that my eyes weren't open up to God's real love for me at that point I didn't feel like I really met Jesus I
29:51
had the Holy Spirit I believed in God I loved him but I feel like I didn't really meet him tangibly
29:57
and I was lukewarm therefore because you can't fall in someone fall in love with someone you haven't met and
30:03
only heard about and I was lukewarm I had one foot in the world and then I encountered the power
30:09
of God and instantly I met Jesus I fell in love with him my eyes open up to amazing his love was and I surrendered
30:15
everything and I've been completely surrendered from that day that surrender has only grown Hallelujah
30:21
and so most of these people that's the case for most Christians I mean most or every Christian that's gonna be the same
30:28
story that's gonna be the same story my my story is going to be most or the same for probably most every Christian they
30:35
need to encounter God's power to be able to really surrender not religiously
30:41
surrender but like from the heart really surrender and so people who have demons they
30:49
haven't encountered God's power I mean there might be some cases where
30:54
they did encounter God's power but it wasn't a high enough level of power or maybe they didn't access all the keys
30:59
yet to be free of that demon but for the most part they haven't encountered God's power so number one they are not even
31:06
they might not even be saved a lot of these Christians were demons number two
31:11
um when you have a demon it really makes it hard for you to really see God's love accurately
31:18
this demon is overpowering so much the voice of God you know and you are not
31:24
seeing the the Abundant Life the truth of who Jesus is in your life it's hard for a person with a demon with a demon
31:30
to really see that it's hard for them to really see that and so therefore it's
31:36
going to be hard for them to not to to be surrendered also when you have a demon you can't really be fully
31:42
surrendered because that demon is overtaking that certain area right so if it's that demon of rage or anger you're
31:48
going to be constantly speaking words of death constantly going out of God's will a lot because of that not because you
31:54
want to but that demon is overtaking you you need to get that demon out so that's why I'm saying to be focused
32:02
on getting demons out of people is real love for people is wanting to see them really saved
32:11
we need to sound the alarm we need to be focused on this this is what God's focused on right now this is emergency
32:18
get people saved first then focus on discipling them and other
32:23
things but if they're if they come to the church in a demon manifests in the
32:28
middle of the surface it's time for that demon to get out in the middle of the sermon and it's emergency number one and now
32:35
that person's gonna be able to receive the word of God that they weren't able to receive because that Demon's overtaking them in the sermon
32:43
Hallelujah so um yeah you can share that how it's an
32:48
emergency a lot but but if people are saying that probably their eyes aren't open so depending on their openness you
32:55
can teach them something like this you know you can teach them well God opened up my eyes and the fact is is that
33:00
there's so many Christians that aren't demonic oppression and so this is an emergency this is an emergency
33:05
these demons need to get out people don't need to be living with these demons this is horrible for people to be living with demons this is not
33:11
acceptable as a Christian not acceptable my autistic son has an unhealthy
How to receive complete deliverance
33:17
interest in the demonic prayed over him does it take time for demons to leave or is it immediate
33:23
Deliverance is this somehow preventing his healing so um
33:29
first of all I have a very important message that you need to watch called
33:35
how to receive complete deliverance it's on my YouTube it's one of my playlists how to receive complete deliverance and
33:40
maintain Deliverance actually I need you to watch all of those videos because if you've ever come to where the
33:46
anointing is God's power is moving and you've received prayer whether it was one-on-one from True anointed vessel and
33:54
or you've received it corporately the words declared you need to watch these videos every person needs to take these
34:01
videos very very very very very very importantly powerful like very very to Heart
34:06
because when it comes to receiving Deliverance it's not like a quick fix it's not like
34:11
a quick magic thing happening it's gonna look different for everybody it's some
34:16
people they come in where the anointing is and they immediately see the difference in
34:22
their life completely they're delivered spiritually and physically they see the results they see the evidence they they
34:29
immediately see maybe it's in the middle of the service maybe it's right after the service maybe it's the next day
34:36
they it's immediate but that's not always the case for everyone it is
34:42
spiritual what you're receiving and sometimes as in the case of the people with Leprosy who came to Jesus and Jesus
34:48
said show yourself to the priests it says on their way to the priest they were healed so sometimes for for some
34:54
cases the evidence of the healing and deliverance has happened in the spiritual realm is not seen until later
35:01
and there's not a specific day that it happens it's different for everybody sometimes it could be a longer amount of
35:08
time till they see the manifestation that's why I'm saying these messages are
35:13
so important for you to listen to because I share these deeper spiritual things that a lot of people don't know
35:19
principles of how to receive complete deliverance and how to maintain your deliverance there's different keys that unlock
35:25
complete deliverance whenever you go to where the anointing is real anointing is real anointing is
35:33
and words have been declared and you have you or your child have oppression have sickness have issues
35:39
if it is true anointing and you've seen the true testimonies of the power of this anointing you need to have faith
35:45
that you have received your child has received healing and deliverance now they might now you or your child may not
35:51
have received complete healing Deliverance because sometimes there's layers and God chooses to deliver in
35:58
layers sometimes but it's so important for you or your child to have that
36:03
proper faith for you or your child that I am coming and I am receiving my
36:10
child is receiving healing and deliverance and that when you leave this place you don't look for evidence you
36:17
don't look for a physical change but you with faith declare that healing or Deliverance has happened
36:24
it's so important you do this because there's because it takes time to manifest sometimes and
36:30
so if you do not really claim it but you're first looking instead for the immediate
36:35
change the devil can literally steal it you the Bible says by his stripes I am
36:42
healed so you first need to believe that even before you come and encounter the anointing and receive these words of
36:48
Declaration of Deliverance and healing from that high level Authority where
36:53
those demons have to obey the sickness has to obey even before that you should be declaring over your life and believing this promise from God his this
36:59
part of your inheritance he's given you by his stripes I am healed and so you
37:05
should see the sickness the oppression in your life or your child's life is something that's unacceptable
37:10
and that Jesus has paid the price for you to be healed and delivered and so as you start to do that that's the action
37:16
of rejecting the devil so you're already renouncing you're already in Warrior of
37:22
Christ mode which you're called to be with not allowing the Devil to stay he's
37:27
come he's brought Yokes but you're saying I'm not allowing you to stay
37:33
that's called This is called faith faith in God's healing and deliverance faith
37:38
in what he did on the cross this is how we should be stubborn in the spirit we are stubborn
37:45
with the devil we mean serious business with the devil and adamantly every day
Where to receive the anointing
37:52
this oppression and sickness in my child in me cannot stay it must go
37:58
and so you should even be doing this before you come to where the anointing is and then where you come where the anointing is you come with faith these
38:05
works are being destroyed today you receive the Declarations whether it's one-on-one or corporately and you don't
38:11
wait to to fall back you don't wait to see a manifestation you don't wait to see a difference you just receive the
38:17
word you just receive the word and you have to leave that place with faith
38:22
knowing there has been change there has been healing and deliverance in me I know it it has to be because I believe
38:28
in the power of God I believe in the power of His anointing I believe the Bible says by his
38:34
anointing the Yoke shall be destroyed so you have this powerful Faith to receive what has been released to you
38:42
and a lot of people miss out on the Miracles of God because they don't have this kind of Faith the the Centurion
38:47
Soldier he said Jesus you don't even need to come to the
38:52
house I believe your anointing is so powerful your Authority is so powerful I believe you just say the word and my
38:58
servant will be healed and so Jesus says the word and that Centurion Soldier
39:04
walked to that house confident I'm gonna find my son healed well we need to be the same way you need to be the same way
39:10
the word has been declared I know I'm going to see change in my son or my daughter or in my life
39:16
it doesn't have to be today maybe it's tomorrow maybe it's a week maybe it's a month maybe it's a couple months from
39:21
now I know I will see change faith is a big ingredient a big key of
Faith
39:27
seeing what's been released in the spiritual manifest of the physical and
39:33
from keeping the door shut to the devil from trying to steal the healing and deliverance that's been brought that you
39:38
haven't even noticed yet but but it's there in the spirit you also have to be so serious about
39:45
um you have to be humble to receive every key because some things are more complex
39:50
in the spirit so in order to see that complete deliverance it sometimes requires more
39:56
keys in the spiritual Realm uh I have a message called how to
40:02
receive complete deliverance that's what I'm telling you watch that because I go through most of the keys and there's another another message
40:10
called the connection between sewing and deliverance that's a key
40:15
sometimes for many people especially with more complex cases and so
40:21
you need to have faith you need to be surrendered and be where the anointing
40:26
is you can't just show up say I'm going to get prayer and then it's the I'm fixed you know what I mean no you you
40:32
need to continually show up and continually be surrendered continue continually show up to where the
40:38
anointing is and keep coming to where God's anointing is any chance you have in person to come come and keep coming
40:44
every time online and live a surrender to life and continue continue to declare
40:50
the truth that healing is yours Deliverance is yours healing Deliverance is yours for your child and continue to
40:56
renounce or reject the devil every day you need to be doing that every day
41:01
and you'll find more of all of this in the maintaining your deliverance messages that I shared that you need to watch okay
41:08
um and you need to be humble to receive every key because there could be a certain key that you
41:15
need to be humble to receive and apply to see that complete deliverance
41:21
released does God still kill people today like for example to protect his anointed
Does God still kill people
41:31
there's the example of ananias and Sapphira in the New Testament is the New
41:37
Testament this is an Old Testament this is New Testament and they lie about
41:44
their tithes they lie about their giving to God they were
41:50
withholding they were still giving but they were withholding and um you know
41:55
they're bringing it to Peter uh and they end up
42:01
dying because of this and um this is New Testament and and there's
42:08
just something to learn from this and that it's that we should not mess with God in his anointed we should
42:13
have the fear of God what you sow you will reap as a real principle
42:19
and God's grace is so great but some people are playing around too much with
42:25
God's grace some people are not repenting and some people are
42:31
not being convicted and are continuing in
42:37
speaking against God speaking against his anointed and um
42:43
that's really really dangerous that's the most dangerous thing in the whole world the most dangerous thing in the
42:48
whole world because what you sow you will reap and sewing that kind of thing is like the
42:55
worst thing I mean you are literally trying to stop God from working you're
43:00
literally trying to stop people from being saved healed and delivered
43:06
that is the worst thing you know what I mean and
43:11
when you're talking about Servants of God when people are talking against Servants of God God wants to do so much through them God
43:18
has so much purpose for them God wants to release millions of Miracles through
43:23
them I mean God wants to lead so many people to be saved to be healed to be delivered through them so talking about
43:30
even just one true anointed servant of God is really really a big deal it's a
43:37
really really really bad it's this is why it's the worst because when God is
43:43
truly using an anointed vessel of God God through them is doing so much like
43:52
so much work so much salvation so much healing so much Deliverance
43:58
specifically through like one person so to be talking even just Against One and at the same time you're saying I
44:05
love God and I'm preaching and it's bad it's really it's the worst
44:11
thing it is literally the worst thing a person can do the most dangerous thing a person can do
44:17
um it's really severe sewing that's happening and so anything is
44:23
possible anything is possible in terms of like destruction that can happen to a person if they continue in this way God
44:31
gives Grace God God gives time God allows a person to repent
44:36
um he usually will not just you know allow person allow someone to
44:42
just be like dead immediately or something because of what they've done but
44:49
and then but we also we also need to talk about covering though as well when you are under covering of true anointing
44:57
you have spiritual protection and it's one of the principles of God is that's the way that he releases protection and
45:04
so um I mean you can't just like go to a
45:10
church and just call it good you need to be surrendered too you know but when you're surrendered and you are under
45:16
that covering it's a serious spiritual protection that's taking place so if you step out of that covering you
45:24
could even be you know not doing really bad things or anything but
45:30
it it it's really dangerous it's like this is God's way of releasing protection when it comes to demonic
45:38
attacks is having a covering spiritual covering and so when you step out of it it's it's
45:44
very dangerous it's kind of it's it's similar to when you are in a spiritual covering it's like if you're a child and
45:51
you're inside a house you're inside the house the doors are locked it's warm it's you're safe you
45:57
have a covering it's you're protected you're nobody can get you but then like to step out of the
46:03
covering is literally like a child a young child opening the door walking outside and standing on the street
46:11
Anything Could Happen the child could wander for years and nothing happens
46:17
or immediately the child could be kidnapped could be hurt could be abused if the vulnerable child is just standing
46:24
on the street you know what I mean so that's how it is in the spiritual Realm where it just becomes very dangerous it
46:31
doesn't mean that when you step out of the covering immediately you're gonna be attacked but
46:37
it really could happen because that's God's way of of releasing that spiritual protection when it comes to demonic
46:43
attacks so so much of like so much of when it comes to things that
God has principles
46:51
happen to people like bad things that happen to people it's kind of more complex than people
46:57
realize like people think that God is just like I'm standing here protecting you all the
47:02
time like but God has principles that's it's more complex God has
47:09
principles and we have to follow these principles just like you will receive
47:14
Abundant Life when you follow the principles of following God's word of putting it into practice you will
47:19
receive Abundant Life when you when you keep the door shut to the devil when you do what God's What God Says in
47:26
his word when you resist the devil you reject the devil you speak with your words you reject the devil constantly you only speak life you don't speak
47:33
death you uh be planted where God's calling you to be planted in a church where you can be receiving spiritual
47:39
food that you need for your spiritual growth to equip you to be not immature but mature against the devil's schemes
47:45
and then you're going to be receiving all this quipping and all this direct word from God to help you in the day
47:51
today to discern the devil's schemes and to be able to reject him and not be deceived by him but to have victory over
47:57
him you you you have bondage but you you you
48:03
you follow God's principles of renouncing and positioning yourself where the anointing is and then you'll be delivered
48:08
right so a lot of people think it's so simple like don't do anything don't follow any God's
48:13
principles but just pray God heal me God deliver me God protect me
48:19
they think it's just simple like that but it's not simple like that you have to follow God's principles and God has a
48:24
lot of principles a lot of different principles for a lot of different things you know so when it comes to like protection like I'm talking about it I'm
48:31
talking about a spiritual principle now spiritual principle
48:36
of protection we got to find we got to follow God's spiritual principle of protection
48:43
be planted stay under that covering be planted where true anointing is so
48:50
that same powerful anointing that has transformed your life through teachings through the anointing
48:57
feeding your spirit through being delivered being healed through seeing other people be touched by the anointing
49:02
delivered healed that same anointing is the anointing up over you covering you
49:07
that the devil cannot come and penetrate
49:14
so it's a it's more of a complex issue when it comes to so so when a person is like speaking against anointed servant
49:19
of God they've just got a whole they're just opening this massive can of worms for
49:25
the devil to just really attack and you know anything could
49:31
happen anything can happen I'm covered under this anointing and I always declare this anointing covers my
49:37
family but what if someone in my family is against this ministry are they covered well they're opening up doors
49:43
and they have their own free will so there's that but there is a special Grace upon them because of you
49:52
it doesn't mean it's like a perfect protection though because they have free will but this this is but but God understands
50:00
God has Grace God has Grace so you just keep on loving them keep on planting seeds until their
50:07
heart is moved and transformed and they can shut all the doors to the devil and
50:12
get fully under the protection of God so I love to receive spiritual food from
Are my priorities wrong
50:18
you that I feel I do that too often instead of reading the Bible are my priorities wrong
50:24
no um so first of all like
50:30
the teachings that I give every week like Sunday Wednesday Friday it's been
50:37
lately it'll be different this coming month because I'm traveling a lot for the most part it's like three times a
50:43
week um live those you should for sure always attend
50:48
um I also have um like two sermons released one or two
50:53
sermons released per week on my YouTube and I have two podcasts released
50:58
um per week as well so that's like what probably about
51:05
one hour-ish per day if you were to like really add that all up I guess that's not that's not that much you know so I
51:11
would say if that's like what you're doing that's great and in a season where you're more hungry
51:17
to watch even more that's that's powerful too um still be in the word but understand
51:23
that the word that I'm teaching it it is the word too the word of God is logos
51:28
and the present tense word of God is Rhema and so all that I'm teaching is is
51:36
the word of God it is coming from the word of God and bringing Revelation upon the word of God so you shouldn't look at
51:42
them as like two different things you should all look at it as the word of God that is needed the fivefold ministry was
51:49
given to the body of Christ to equip the the body so you are being equipped being
51:55
equipped is never a bad thing this is always a good thing um but it is important to just to to
52:02
open your Bible too so make what you if you're struggling with
52:08
like opening your Bible I would say what you should do is start with the
52:13
teachings that I'm teaching when I say scripture which I'm saying scripture a lot not so much in these q and A's
52:20
because I'm just answering live but I reference lots of times to some scriptures but what I have lots of
52:27
scriptures in every sermon every sermon I have lots like usually
52:32
probably four five six more um write them down go to them read the
52:40
context read around it read the whole chapter so that what you're being equipped with you're being fully
52:45
equipped it's helping to stay in you more because you're going in the word you're meditating on it you're
52:51
meditating on the word with the true Revelation a lot of people are reading too much of the word of God with no
52:57
Revelation with just religious Revelation and they're not listening enough to the Rhema word of God that's anointed so listening to a lot of the
53:03
Rhema word that's anointed is important because it's really helping you get out of that religious Doctrine so you're not
53:10
reading the Bible wrong and it's helping you so when you open up the word of God you're really able to hear God's voice
53:18
so you should never really feel if you're feeling like a a pull to really watch like my teachings for example that
53:24
is never a wrong thing even if it's like watching all day that is never a wrong thing but just when I am preaching the
53:32
the specific scriptures take them to heart really listen to the word of God really take the word of God to heart and
53:38
so write down the scriptures and pause the video if it's not alive if it is alive afterwards spend some time in the
53:45
Bible but go and look at the scriptures one by one and read Around It Read maybe
53:51
the whole chapter read the context more you know start there if you're finding like you
53:59
have a hard time opening the Bible much but you don't need to feel like oh I watched two hours of of a teaching today
54:06
so I need to make sure I watch I read two hours of the Bible that's being religious no don't look don't like set a
54:14
timer like that but just take the word of God that you're hearing to heart and seriously write it down open your Bible
54:21
read it meditate on it and at the same time make a practice it is also good to make a practice of
54:27
reading the Bible like on your own like start in in the gospels
54:33
and John for example and make it a practice maybe make it a discipline of reading maybe like one chapter a day and
54:39
just make it a discipline that takes probably um 15 minutes or less to even read one
54:44
chapter just make it start making it a discipline if you're finding like you're not doing it many times it's that you
54:50
just need to start that habit not a religious ritual but put it into motion
Is it wrong to plant yourself online
54:57
if you plant yourself in an anointed online church but go to a church in your area as well is that wrong no that's not
55:03
wrong it's going to be different for everybody for some people God will really impress on some people's heart I just want you to be planted online don't
55:10
go to another place physically um but for other people if you feel it's
55:16
the importance of physically being in a church physically that's fine that's
55:22
fine but what is important be virtually uh planted like at five of church for
55:27
example that's fine but the really important thing to remember is to know where you're planning because you can
55:33
only be planted in one place and where you're planted is where you're really receiving from you're really receiving
55:38
the word of God from and being equipped from and it is where you receive an impartation of anointing from and it is
55:45
where you are really sowing where you are where you're planted is where you
55:50
should really be giving your your seed not like a like a partial seed but like
55:56
you want to make sure that you're planted in one place one place and so you can give your your
56:02
all you can serve with Excellence you you know we're called to be planted in one place so you got to make sure that
56:10
you understand all these things and you understand this is where I'm receiving from
56:15
um it's really important because like for example at fivefold church
56:21
God has brought Revival God has poured out this anointing and God is breaking
56:27
religion and he's releasing just so much Revelation he's opening eyes he's
56:32
releasing special keys and secrets of accessing the anointing um deeper things in the spiritual me as
56:38
an apostle I have a different Grace uh to reveal the deeper things to open up
56:45
spiritual eyes and just even my calling specifically on what God's calls me to do in this revival is just going to be
56:51
very different from other people and it's going to involve just a great opening up of eyes and a great equipping
56:58
and maturing of the Saints Apostles mature mature the Believers and so there's a lot of that missing the body
57:05
of Christ today there's a lot of anointing missing there's a lot of maturing missing there's a lot of uh teaching that actually opens up eyes and
57:11
and really really matures people and equips people a lot of that missing so let's say you go to a church where
57:17
there's not that Grace there's not that anointing there's not that equipping there's not that teaching you know
57:23
you're going there physically but you're playing it online like a five church for example so you have to have that
57:28
understanding that there is um the teaching won't really coincide very
57:35
well you know um like it could be confusing
57:42
it can be confusing there's not that Grace there um
57:48
at another place for example there's not that specific anointing there and so when eyes aren't opened as much like
57:55
somewhere for example it it people could say something's wrong
58:00
that's not wrong just because their eyes are shut you know so there can be confusion so what I that's why I say if
58:07
you are going to another church physically just make sure you understand this truth and understand you know where
58:13
you are planted so like multiple teachings aren't like confusing you you
58:20
know and you're not you're also not getting you're not being fed too many things that you can't really digest what
58:26
God wants you to truly focus on and Digest that's the thing you just need to like
58:31
stay focused and renew your mind that that church that you're attending physically this is your missional place
58:38
your place where your heart is I want to see their eyes opened up I want them to encounter the anointing I want them to
58:44
be free let's say if it's a church that doesn't know about Deliverance that doesn't know about the anointing or maybe not as high of a level of
58:50
anointing um it should be like missional like I want where I am planted I've received so
58:57
much and I want these people here who I see physically to receive too so through maybe relationships that you have you
59:04
can just start sharing testimonies and just be planting seeds so you should kind of see it as a missional thing like
59:10
this is I'm here on a mission as I'm here physically and rather to get
59:16
confused of like I'm receiving here I'm receiving here and there's a clashing and there's a might be distraction
59:22
pulling you from really focusing on where God wants to build you up for your
59:27
purpose is it wrong just up into leadership at a non-anointed church and consider ourselves under your anointing and cover
59:35
under your covering and planted at 5f that's a very delicate
59:40
that would be a very unique situation that would just depend on this person and the situation and the true mission
59:48
of God that's not a very common thing that's so I can't give a one-way answer so if that
59:54
is you email us at info 5fchurch.org for that kind of specific question like that
1:00:01
will it will just depend on what God wants to do in that specific case and for that specific person
1:00:07
what to do if there's a Pharisee that wants to change you but you live with them like don't have coffee with a
1:00:13
Pharisee but I live with them I mean just you have to just kind of be
1:00:20
more professional you know you have to be more professional I know you live with them but just try to
1:00:27
have more boundaries and not just share so much about your personal life not share so much if they really do not want
1:00:33
to they're really not interested in receiving this anointing this truth
1:00:39
the testimonies they don't want to hear it respect that and just like stay quiet
1:00:45
and keep to yourself um that's the safe way and just kind of
1:00:51
make it known like by your silence and by your professionalism by putting boundaries
1:00:58
you're kind of making it known like though we live together um there's you know you're not the person
1:01:05
that I'm like accepting advice from and we live together I love you but just
1:01:12
just try to be more maybe little by little more professional more keeping to
1:01:18
yourself um just to kind of show though we live together you know there
1:01:24
still has to be boundaries um and you know you can't be like this Authority in my life this authority to
1:01:30
give me advice as authority to just say whatever um and try to change me
1:01:37
also question do all pastors and churches are they supposed to be doing Deliverance or it depends on the calling
1:01:44
um well now it's it's quite quite wild to say this but yes yes I
1:01:51
mean the Bible says all who believe these signs shall follow they shall cast out demons they shall heal the sick
1:01:58
they shall be able to raise the dead they shall preach that the kingdom of God is at hand this is a requirement of
1:02:04
a Believer this is what all believers should do not just pastors but all believers should be able to cast out demons simply because they carry the
1:02:10
anointing when you carry the anointing it's not hard for demons to go it's not hard for demons to go we all
1:02:16
have different callings in terms of how the levels of demonic powers that we can
1:02:22
cast out we have different callings in that regard we have different levels of anointing but with a small measure of
1:02:29
anointing that can cast out a demon so even if your calling is to have more of a smaller measure of anointing just
1:02:36
depending on your calling you can still cast out a demon a lower level demon at least you know so this is
1:02:43
what it should look like in every Church yes and as simple as this every Pastor
1:02:49
should be a vessel of the anointing not like a Deliverance anointing no anointing destroys the Yoke period every
1:02:55
vessel should carry the anointing every every believer should carry the anointing let alone pastors and
1:03:02
ministers they better care they should carry the anointing because to carry the anointing
1:03:09
is to be a vessel of God in power a vessel of God in his fullness so that when you're ministering you're
1:03:15
not just talking about God but God in power is moving through you when you're
1:03:21
preaching anointings flowing through you and is feeding people in the spirit not just
1:03:27
touching their soul and making them feel good and making them feel impressed by a sermon but they don't change this is how
1:03:33
every Pastor every Minister should be they should carry real anointing that when they preach the anointing comes
1:03:38
forth and that those who have demons they start to manifest
1:03:43
in their presence and the demons have to go and the sick should be healed that's
1:03:49
how it should be but the anointing is so rare and God is changing things now and will it look like
1:03:55
one day every Church carrying the anointing no because we have free will and God doesn't give anointing to just
1:04:01
anybody you have to have a trustworthy heart and unfortunately there will be pastors who won't come in line with this
1:04:07
but the good news is that in this end time Revival God is transforming the True Body of Christ and we are going to
1:04:14
see churches all over all over carry the true anointing so it's going to switch
1:04:19
from being the minority to being more more prevalent way more prevalent to see
1:04:25
the anointing in churches all over the world Hallelujah
1:04:31
thank you Jesus thank you Lord for what you did on this live I declare over every person here right now
1:04:37

1:04:42
