0:00
does 5f have anointing for sale no because it's really not
0:08
um it's really under the area of religion to just pray over oil and hand
0:14
it out it really should be first of all spirit-led God can move through oil God
0:20
can move through handkerchiefs God can move through different things uh like release
0:26
anointing to a T-shirt and giving it but
0:31
it's important we don't commercialize his anointing and it's
0:36
also important we do not treat it like something easy and cheap to
0:44
receive because he doesn't work in that way
0:49
um like here's one example some people always some people sometimes say
0:55
whenever like they see a healings happen the the critics many times will
1:01
say they they're angry and they're like well why aren't you going to hospitals and praying for everyone there and well
1:10
really the answer is that the way God's power works is not just like here
1:16
everyone receive it everyone receive Miracles right now there's an element of Faith that's required to receive God's
1:23
Miracles there's principles there's surrender and faith God doesn't force
1:28
himself so there's this principle of we must desire Jesus in all of his ways we
1:36
have to believe that he wants to heal us and also believe in how he releases
1:43
healing and deliverance his principles like have faith in have faith in respect
1:48
and reverence to his ways of moving for example through vessels through anointed Servants of God so you can have someone
1:56
who maybe uh stubbornly maybe because of
2:01
Pride doesn't want to doesn't want to believe in Apostles and Prophets doesn't maybe doesn't want to believe in a
2:07
certain vessel of doesn't want to believe that God is using a certain vessel and power to heal and deliver
2:13
like let's say Let's Pretend We're in the Biblical times and like Apostle Paul shows up today like pretend Apostle Paul
2:19
is in our times and let's say someone's like jealous of apostle Paul or they
2:25
being judgmental and religious and offended
2:31
because he had such a bad past and so it's like they see God using him so
2:36
powerfully and maybe themselves they didn't murder anybody they didn't have
2:42
they didn't have such a bad past like Paul did and so maybe that person's feeling jealous like why is God using
2:49
that person you know oh that's not fair like he did so many bad things in the
2:55
past and now God's choosing him and giving him all this honor you know
3:00
people can be that way right and so but like you see in the Bible where it says acts 1911 God was doing such
3:07
extraordinary Miracles through the hands of apostle Paul that even people they they would he
3:15
would touch handkerchiefs and aprons and then release it to people who are do and oppressed and sick and they'd be healed
3:20
and delivered and so when you read the Bible when you read the sto that scripture when you read about the
3:27
ministry of Paul you see that he is really a chosen one like he was really a chosen one so like in his time God was
3:35
really choosing to use him in extraordinary anointing it wasn't that God wasn't using other people but when
3:41
it came to this high level extraordinary anointing extraordinary anointing where
3:47
even the the the the highest princip demonic principalities had to obey that
3:53
anointing even the most um like hugest diseases had to obey and leave when the
4:02
anoint when that anointing came there was something specific that that Paul was chosen for and so there if it's if
4:11
it's today's time and Paul shows up and there's someone who's really sick or really demon oppressed and God has
4:18
literally chosen to heal that person through Paul like God God's like I want to heal my child here but this is how
4:24
I'm going to do it I'm going to do it through the anointing I'm releasing through Paul if that person doesn't want
4:30
to receive the anointing through Paul they won't get healed they won't get free I mean they can't just choose Faith
4:40
their way Jesus their way you know it's very simple to receive Miracles and to
4:46
receive the anointing from Jesus but many people miss it because they can't do that simple thing of
4:52
humbling themselves and just being obedient to God's ways and receiving it through the vessel he wants to use
4:58
because the vessel he wants to use are weak and foolish things which means it
5:03
it offends people usually like people are like people are jealous and people have other issues like they're being
5:10
religious like they're not used to God using Apostles and Prophets and um I I just
5:18
saw someone say something like actually I just saw someone say something and they're they they have the title of a
5:24
prophet themselves and they were like I used to not I used to not like tit cuz I
5:30
felt like people were being prideful when they used them but then I understood that um it's like a doctor
5:38
like a doctor doesn't say um oh don't call me doctor like it's
5:44
important you know what their profession is what their position is so that you
5:50
can know oh it's safe to go here like so that the doctor can perform what they were called to perform so that they can
5:56
actually help people so it's the same thing thing today if you go to a church
6:02
you want to know who the pastor is if the pastor's like no no no no there's no pastors here I'm just I'm just the same
6:10
as you all then that's actually going to bring confusion and bring less respect
6:15
to when that Pastor who's not calling themselves a pastor delivers the word because they're going to be like well
6:22
they have the same wisdom and knowledge as I do so why am I like taking the message that seriously like that's what
6:27
would like happen in the mind you know so people understand there is an importance in calling a pastor pastor
6:34
and that that title being there it's for the good of the people to to have that
6:40
like respect reverence awareness knowing what they're getting like okay I'm going to the doctor you go to the doctor you
6:46
feel like you can rest you're at peace they're a professional they're going to be able to help you it's the same thing for the pastor
6:52
and so it's the same thing for Apostles and Prophets um evangelists and teachers but they are releasing something special
6:58
that you need so you need the the the the ministry that comes from the Apostle you need the ministry that comes from
7:04
the prophet there's an equipping that comes through those offices a spiritual nutrients equipping and impartation that
7:11
comes through those offices that you need so really we should have the mindset of like where are the true Apostles not where are the true anointed
7:18
Servants of God but I don't want to hear their titles cuz that offends me we should really have we should really be
7:25
like where are the true pastors like where's the doc I'm sick I need a doctor I I have a toothache I need the dentist
7:31
like you know I I I I need the apostolic Ministry
7:37
I need the power of God in my life I need equipping mature to be a mature disciple where's the apostles you know I
7:44
need to know what's going on in the spiritual realm in my life where's the prophets so um yeah anyways that's like
7:52
a really religious like wrong Doctrine is this this wrong thinking of if
7:58
someone calls an apostle or someone calls himself a prophet they are putting that title on themselves they are
8:05
appointing themselves and they are prideful they think they're so special that's this wrong Doctrine this wrong
8:11
way of thinking people don't think that way towards pastors you know so why are they thinking that way towards Apostles
8:17
and Prophets um I think a lot of people think that they're trying that if someone calls themselves an apostle
8:23
they're like because they're so rare today they think that they're putting them on the same level as like Apostle Paul and Apostle Peter or something
8:29
something and they think they're so special I don't know it's it's a wrong Doctrine it's a wrong Doctrine so anyways you have people with this like
8:36
offense like H why is this person calling himself an apostle and they just
8:42
start feeling the wrong way towards that person towards a true Apostle and then
8:47
that's blocking them off from being able to receive from them the anointing you don't respect you can't receive so um so
8:56
but God wants to use that vessel to heal them to deliver them and if they're going to be stubborn God doesn't go
9:02
against his word his principles he won't be manipulated so people become stuck and they don't receive healing and freedom so all that to say is is that um
9:12
the anointing isn't cheap Miracles aren't cheap it's not like here everyone
9:18
receive it's I mean we're called to freely release to everybody but we we are we are we have to understand it's
9:25
not us who has all the power to heal and deliver it's also people that have the power to receive by their
9:32
faith and so we are called to go to those who want to receive Jesus who want
9:38
to receive the anointing we are called to to do that to not force our way and
9:43
to not just like it would be not wise for me to go someplace and force the anointing on
9:50
people when they need to desire it it would be like it'd be like a waste when
9:57
I could be student stewarding it the right way on good
10:02
ground I'm on good soil putting the seed on good soil
10:08
rather than throwing pearls to swines rather than throwing throwing all the anointing on a place where God's shown
10:15
me there's no good ground here go where the good ground is where it can be received just like Jesus said to the
10:21
disciples if they don't receive you dust your feet off and move on so that's that principle that's
10:29
that's why um as anointed Servants of God you don't just go everywhere and
10:35
just pray for everybody and just Storm Into the hospitals and be like I have the anointing you'll be healed let me
10:42
pray for you um let me knock on every door of the hospital now and release
10:48
this anointing you know but rather I I do the zoom call and I open it up for I use my
10:55
platform that has such a big reach past one million people on my platform that
11:01
God's opened up doors for me to be able to reach that milon people and I so then I use wisdom to make a post and say come
11:08
and receive healing and deliverance and I know that whoever comes to that Zoom call and comes to that live stream they
11:15
are that's the action of positioning themselves to receive that anointed handkerchief or apron to receive that
11:22
shadow coming upon them and so I know at that point anybody who's watching people
11:27
in the hospital whether I pray for them oneon-one or they're just there listening they'll
11:33
receive so anyways you know as an anointed servant
11:39
of God I have to walk with that wisdom and I have to walk I have to Steward the anointing well and I can have to make
11:44
sure I'm not cheapening the anointing and I'm not um portraying the anointing
11:49
to be cheap and to be for everybody I mean it is for everyone who desires to
11:56
receive it but if you make it equival equalent to going to the grocery store and buying olive oil like making it that
12:04
in that kind of same way it's um it's not really the right way it's it's it's
12:11
a it's it's it's it's it's teaching something wrong it's teaching that
12:16
there's no element of Faith it's teaching that it's just like yep easy quick just give me the oil and I get the
12:23
miracle like um like taking God out of it taking faith in God out of it taking
12:29
God's principles out of it um because then it bypasses receiving from a vessel
12:35
if if you if you can just buy anointing from me or get an or get oil from me
12:40
then you can just pour it on people who whether they want to receive God's Apostles and Prophets God's servants or
12:45
not and it won't work that way you see I can't just give you the anointing and
12:51
you just spread it everywhere how you want and it just works like that no that's that's really the purpose of why
12:59
um there are circumstances where uh uh like I I can pray for a handkerchief or
13:07
a uh apron if if someone has a family member that's really sick and they can't get in
13:16
person they can't come in person then God will lead me to do that but it's not every time it's not every person that's
13:24
bringing Just handkerchiefs and aprons to the church service God is is not calling me to just cheaply put it put
13:32
the anointing there um we also have to make sure we're not thinking of it just
13:38
as this cheap way of like oh this this this is a magic handkerchief you know what I mean we have to stay true to
13:44
God's principles these principles of positioning yourself where the anointing is uh and positioning yourself at the
13:51
church service the ministry time so that you receive the power of God and also the word when we we can't just throw
13:59
anointing on handkerchiefs and aprons and oil and then you know be sending the
14:06
wrong message that going to church going to the online Ministry receiving the
14:12
word of God isn't important we just got the magic the special handkerchief and that's all we
14:19
need you know what I mean so that's the wisdom in it that's the wisdom in it is is is is is is making sure we're not
14:25
teaching something wrong to people we're not cheapening the anointing we're not leading people away from God's important
14:32
principles and ways of surrender of faith in him of faith believing in his Apostles and Prophets positioning
14:38
yourself to receive planning yourself in a church where God's power is that it's not just about receiving Miracles but
14:44
you being equipped to to be a mature powerful vessel of God being a disciple
14:49
and receiving the word so for so anyways like when God leads me to pray for handkerchiefs and aprons it's in
14:56
circumstances where a person uh a person person's family member for example there's no way for them to get to the
15:03
church physically or an event physically there's no way um and also when that's
15:09
re when when I release that the the person has to Value it too that they
15:15
have to they have to Value they have to um know the significance of this and not
15:21
receive it in a cheap way and I lastly want to say this about anointing oil
15:26
like we're trying to get out of the old wine we we're not just trying we're God's taking us out of the old wine and
15:32
and so there's certain things that are so old wine and the anointing oil
15:38
putting it all over the house and and everything and and just just the way it's been
15:47
done there's a lot of old wine in that um you know I I taught a a a
15:55
message not too long ago I encourage you all to watch it's on my YouTube it's
16:00
um What's the title of it it was like a month or so
16:07
ago I think it's oh unafraid and unshaken I think that's the title of message unafraid and unshaken but I
16:14
spoke about how um when you are planted where the
16:19
anointing is where the power of God is that anointing is in your life that covering is in your life you don't have
16:26
to a lot of you don't have to go seek for like an oil like that anointing is flowing in your life so it's like yes
16:33
God can use oil but it's supposed to be just for special time significant times I I used oil one time at the flourish
16:39
conference has God led me to release the the the anointing on it and and that's
16:44
how it should be rather than like okay every single person I'm praying for oil oil oil oil oil it's supposed to be led
16:50
by the Holy Spirit and a special meaning and that's not the only way that the anointing is released it's just one way
16:57
um and so in the old winkin way you know people are so fearful they're like they
17:03
go to a hotel room and they think that an oil just any oil that they like pray
17:11
for or that a pastor prays for just any Pastor prays for is going to be so special and protect them and they'll put
17:18
it in the in their the hotel room or even their house when really when you're
17:24
actually planted where God's anointing is there's a covering of anointing over you that same anointing powerful
17:31
extraordinary anointing that's in your spiritual father or mother the leader
17:36
like Apostle Paul for example extraordinary anointing that same powerful anointing that's making demons tremble and leave people that same
17:43
anointing is in your life and it's the covering upon you so demons see that
17:50
it's it's like and even if even if you don't haven't received the impartation yet because it's just not God's timing
17:57
yet for you to receive Mighty impart to cast out demons that same anointing of
18:02
covering is on your life and demons see that and they're terrified of that and
18:08
they have to flee and so if you really have faith if you have that spiritual Revelation and faith and who you are in
18:16
Christ in the powerful anointing where you're planted that's your covering when you go to a hotel room for example you
18:24
know this truth that if there's any demons in that hotel hotel room they have left as soon
18:30
as you've even arrived in that hotel before you even got to the room because the anointing you carry is so powerful
18:37
the covering that's over you is so powerful and you have Angels protecting you and these angels know how important
18:45
you are in the Kingdom especially because of your place in God's Revival
18:51
Army the fact that you're doing things God's way the fact that you're planted where the anointing is even if you
18:57
haven't received a powerful impart ation yet and you don't see yourself as you know doing such powerful things in the
19:02
kingdom of God like the Angels know how valuable and important you are and
19:08
so like the Angels the angel angels are getting rid of anything I mean doing
19:15
things in the spiritual realm um for your protection and so even if there were demons like in the hotel room left
19:21
over from the people that were there before or something like that they go just because of what you carry the
19:27
anointing you carry who you are and who's backing you up the angels that are
19:32
with you so um the proper way is like you walk in
19:37
the hotel room and you don't have to say a special prayer or anything I mean when you know who you
19:44
are they're already gone that they they can't stay like they
19:49
cannot stay when I go to minister in a church in a in a in a theater for
19:55
example that different things are going on throughout the week I'm not having to
20:01
go every demon that was in this place from last night get out of here no I just walk in and I know how powerful
20:07
this anointing is it becomes it becomes Sanctified when I when I step to that
20:14
place even even before I stepped to that place in the spiritual realm it's known that this is our do this is my Dominion
20:21
my territory on Sundays this is my dominion and territory so it's just as
20:26
Sanctified as if it was a my own church building that I built myself with no
20:32
other activities going on throughout the week from people in the world or anything um so you know that's another
20:40
reason why we can't like why God's calling me and us to not do the old
20:46
wines skin way with the oil so much is that it's like PE people are missing this revelation of the power of the
20:52
anointing that you carry the angels with you and the covering of anointing upon you and they're putting their faith in
20:59
oil that has no power most of the time like they themselves are just like praying over it or pastors without
21:05
anointing are like praying over it and so the the anointing doesn't even have any power I mean the oil doesn't have
21:11
any even power so let me give you an example like I just I've been hearing
21:17
several testimonies at the flourish conference you know there was one time I declared over people people's CH I know
21:25
a lot of people left children home their children home and I know a lot of people had just family members that had that
21:31
didn't come to the first conference that needed freedom and healing and there was one time I declared to their family
21:38
members I said I release this anointing to them now um and there was several testimonies
21:47
even I listened to one today that was on my story I listened to one today I think
21:52
she's in I forget where she's from but I
21:57
listen to one day and um actually I don't know if this one's on my story I
22:03
it might have been one that was sent to my email that I watched today but I listened to his testimony today where that a miracle happened at that at that
22:09
moment when I when I released the anointing to the family
22:16
members there was some something wrong with their finger some I don't know what
22:22
it was something but it was horrible and they were it was healed at that instant when that person was in another country
22:28
I believe yeah another country and on Sunday right after the flers conference
22:34
I think it was the next day of this particular moment that I declared these things over family members there was a
22:40
man from Australia um and he shared that he he
22:46
lifted his the picture up of his son and his son is battle with suicidal attempts and everything like really hard past and
22:56
um and like right after that moment I think it was right after the moment that
23:01
I declared that I think it was like right after he immediately got a text
23:06
message from his son saying something like I don't know what just happened but the chains broke off of me like he
23:15
experienced Deliverance freedom in Australia so you you see the power of
23:21
the anointing not the power of the oil when the anointing is released on the oil in God's holy spirit L timing
23:29
so powerful but the power is in the anointing the power is in the anointing
23:35
not the power in the oil the powers and the anointing so the powers and the anointing how the Holy Spirit leads a
23:40
servant of God to release it also there's also um times when you've
23:46
received impartation and God wants you to use your Dominion your Authority like over your own family members and declare
23:51
there's been so many testimonies of people seeing their family members set free from demons healed of sicknesses
23:57
when they after they receiv received impartation from being planted at F full church and declaring over their children
24:03
their family members uncountable testimonies I have heard of their family members receiving healing and freedom
24:08
after they declared so you see the powers in the anointing it's not that they were like I need to find oil no
24:15
they needed to receive the anointing which comes most of the time through the declaring of the word the servant of God
24:21
executing the authority in Christ and releasing the anointing the power of the words the the the and positioning
24:28
yourself for the anointing is just flowing like a waterfall so you need to get yourself under the waterfall of anointing in the spiritual
24:34
realm which is coming and person and coming online and just sit there under
24:40
the waterfall you don't need to go buy the oil you don't need to seek something physical and oil you need to just simply
24:46
position yourself where the anointing is simple simple
24:52
Hallelujah says you said that one time you did a mistake and your spiritual father saw it in the spirit yeah that
24:57
was like when I was a baby very baby in the spirit like within the
25:06
um within the first few months of receiving the
25:14
prophecy and becoming a spiritual daughter of my spiritual father um that's when that happened you
25:21
said that one time you did a mistake and your spiritual father saw in the spirit and he warned you yeah it was so powerful it was so amazing to be like
25:27
cuz I didn't even no it was it was wrong I mean I did I felt weird um because it was having to do with like I was going
25:34
to another church at the time CU I didn't have that Revelation yet and my spiritual father really walks in wisdom
25:40
because it's important to go gentle and it's important for like many times it's very important
25:47
for like as a spiritual parent it's
25:52
important for your children to um learn the holy spirit's voice
25:59
and um instead of being like oh you did this wrong you did this wrong you did this
26:04
wrong it's important well first of all to be gentle so like the more someone
26:10
matures the more like direct you can be but when they're a baby still you don't
26:17
want to break them and so it's amazing like my spiritual father walked in such wisdom and how he um help and how he was
26:26
used by God how God used him to uh make me to grow and correct me um there's a
26:35
lot of wisdom that is needed for a spiritual parent um because it's delicate it's
26:43
like the heart is delicate and you really want that your spiritual child
26:50
to grow strong and not be broken and you know it's just it's just the
26:57
wisdom is very important So like
27:02
um you know there I I I didn't even know it was
27:08
wrong but and it was having to do with the mistake I made was having to do with I was going to another church at the
27:14
time and like there was something that happened of like laying hands on me of
27:20
leadership and um it was like what was going on in the
27:25
spiritual realm is they were like really wanted me to submit and come under their
27:31
covering it's not like those words were being said but that's what was going on in the spiritual realm and through the
27:36
actions and words said that was um that was what was
27:43
happening you no and at this time you know it's I had a very unique situation
27:50
because God I'm kind of like kind of like Abraham in a way like Abraham had
27:57
this just like super unique calling he's God's like I'm calling you to leave
28:02
everything be on your own go to his new land and so for me God was calling me to
28:08
bring this new wine and be like this like a leader in the body of Christ and but when God first called me I I wasn't
28:16
grown to be a leader in the body of Christ yet at all I was a baby um but God was calling me to really
28:24
bring this new wine and like what my spiritual father
28:30
carried the wisdom he carried of this new wine and anointing simply wasn't found like other
28:38
places and and um it was very important like if my spiritual father was Apostle
28:43
Paul it was very important for me to be like Timothy and really come under him and just be planted there but it was a
28:50
unique situation because he is in tan East Africa and um here I am and I'm
28:57
used to going to church all the time but there was this transition that God wanted me to make where I I took myself
29:03
out of the church I was going to and it was this molding time for about at least seven eight months before I actually
29:10
started fivefold church it was soon that God called me to start fivefold church but I needed to really go away from
29:16
Abram land and like be on my own to become Abraham and go to this new land
29:22
where now so I I I go from being um a church member to a church
29:29
leader that type of transition so um but like my spiritual father was so gentle
29:34
and wasn't like here are the rules like you need to leave this church you know
29:39
he was just so led by the Holy Spirit and gentle and um so at the time I was going there and I felt weird when that
29:47
was happening like I could I sense there's something weird about it and then my spiritual father like saw in the
29:53
spiritual real what happened cuz he's a prophet so God reveals to him when
29:59
dangerous things are happening in spiritual realm to me I mean that's his responsibility I'm his responsibility in spiritual realm so he like knew exactly
30:06
what happened and he gently asked me like this happened I said yes and when
30:12
he spoke I was like oh wow like that was the Holy Spirit like I it was beautiful
30:18
because it confirmed to me I was feeling like this was weird and maybe wrong but I wasn't quite sure and oh that was the
30:24
Holy Spirit speaking to me so anyways that's just some context about how um
30:30
one time I had made a mistake and my spiritual father corrected me so lovingly and and um anyways this
30:37
question was will I correct you if I see something wrong yeah so I will say part
30:43
one and part two part one is the like you have to understand
30:49
that it's like I feel like sometimes we want just tell me what to do like it's easier to just for for for for a mentor
30:57
for a spiritual mother or father to just like hold your hand and tell you turn this way turn this way turn this way
31:02
turn this way but you have to learn how to hear the
31:07
holy spirit's voice you have to learn how to use wisdom you have like my message that I taught on
31:13
Wednesday um I taught if you didn't watch it make sure you watch it it's on my YouTube from this Wednesday but I was
31:19
teaching really about the power of wisdom and so you need to grow up and to
31:24
be a mature disciple and um you need to have your own relationship
31:30
with God and um you need to learn how to hear the holy spirit's voice and use wisdom
31:36
to make daily decisions in life um God wants you to be not a baby but
31:41
spiritually mature so that you're in a place where you can help others and if you need handholding all the time you're
31:47
not going to really be able to help others and holy spirit wants you to have that relationship with him um and to
31:55
hear his voice and to know how to use wisdom be mature and use
32:01
wisdom um and so like that's a part of the reason
32:07
why like a spiritual parent won't like tell you every little thing and maybe
32:12
some like some like we can want we can desire that I want you to correct me every second like I want you to tell me
32:19
to go this way this way this way tell me oh you did this thing wrong you tell me but we I can't do that like God doesn't
32:25
want me to do that because you have to you have to grow you have to learn you
32:30
have to you and the way you do this is by as
32:36
what I taught on Wednesday is really being a disciple and
32:42
intaking the wisdom I'm releasing so I'm sharing with you this is the revelation of the word of God here is
32:50
wisdom here you go and now if you will take it and value it and return to it renew your mind to it renew your mind
32:57
with it now you have just gained wisdom and now
33:02
you can make the right decisions you can hear God's voice now because you taken
33:08
what I've given you what God's released through me to you and you that's the way
33:14
God wants it and so that's why a spiritual parent can't be too much in your business I mean too much like
33:22
control or whatever because that's the opposite of
33:27
helping you grow and use the wisdom that's been given to you right so there's sometimes I see
33:36
people doing things weird or saying things weird or saying
33:41
things religious and I'm like wait haven't they um been here for a while
33:47
have don't they notice that I never talk about that that I that I actually teach this and d d d da and to me it shows me
33:54
that they're not valuing uh the word cuz it's very clear
33:59
and so I pray for them but my but I know that God doesn't want me to Baby them
34:05
but sometimes it means like them having to Humble themselves because they know deep down they're
34:13
they're ignoring the wisdom and then God will give them time and uh correct them
34:20
and then they will remember you know what I know that this isn't what has been taught to me you know so um I have
34:28
to be hands off many times um so that
34:33
Holy Spirit can work in them like that I wouldn't get in the way of holy spirit's
34:39
ways of um gently and slowly convicting and um
34:46
correcting if that makes sense you know what I mean um so yeah and like there's a wisdom to
34:54
that too like if somebody does something like um opposite of what's been taught
35:01
many times that's an act of Disobedience on their part they're choosing to do that and so if I were to be like that's
35:11
wrong don't you remember I've taught that they already know and that will probably make them not be able to
35:17
receive it well they'll they'll be like maybe offended you know um and that's why that's not the wisdom in that
35:24
area amen and I've seen this many time happen I've seen like um
35:31
someone like not value the teachings cuz I know like I know that they're always
35:36
there you know listening to the teachings and I've seen them like do opposite of the teachings for example
35:42
but I've seen them like as God worked in their heart and brought conviction and they chose to surrender I've seen them
35:48
correct their ways I've seen them you know without me like hands off me me being hands off but seeing that happen
35:56
amen hallelujah hallelujah so but also I want
36:02
to keep on answering that question well I correct when I see things are wrong yeah so sometimes um actually that's how
36:09
God speaks prophetically to me about what to teach on because I'm very I'm
36:15
very like aware spiritually of of my spiritual children you know and um even
36:22
your testimonies or just things that I see God will show me oh look in this
36:28
area the enem is deceiving in this area sometimes it's just one person God will use to as a highlight other times it's
36:35
um a a several people and God will really show me it's a way he prophetically speaks you see the enemy
36:42
is deceiving in this area there's confusion in this area or maybe it's that I haven't taught on that subject
36:48
yet like it hasn't been the time to teach on this subject yet so the people don't know this yet they don't know this
36:54
part of the new one yet now it's time to teach on this on this subject right here
36:59
I remember this like I taught a message on order in the church and there was a bunch of things out of nowhere like
37:04
specific people doing old wine things out of order and God really spoke it's time to teach this message
37:12
right now and after teaching it eyes opened up and correction came and order
37:17
came so that's why it's so important that you are a disciple a real disciple
37:23
that values the teachings because sometimes it could be something you're you you know you're doing you're making
37:28
a mistake of in life and um whether God showed it to me showed it to me
37:34
specifically for your life or God just knew himself and led me to teach on this
37:41
the message is correcting you the message is for you is is a correction
37:46
coming to you that will be the big way that the correction happens um another
37:52
way correction happens like if you uh uh if you
37:57
if you want correction you have to humble yourself you really have to humble
38:03
yourself um some people have have asked questions um and I I and
38:11
just know we don't have a big team answering our emails so sometimes please just please be patient it might take one
38:17
or two or more weeks to respond to your question or please just send it again if it wasn't responded to and also have the
38:24
humility to know that if it wasn't responded to it might be that there's that question doesn't need to be answered like God sees that that
38:30
question doesn't need to be answered so just have that awareness but there has there has been some people who have
38:35
emailed things in humility like being like I don't know the right thing to do in this situation
38:42
or I've been doing this thing and I think maybe it's wrong um what is your
38:48
uh advice you know and and I'll tell them straight out you know I'll tell them I'll bring that
38:55
correction um but it's it's like that principle of
39:00
Correction is the same principle of of God like God's main principle if he
39:06
doesn't force himself ask and the and ask seek and knock and then the door
39:12
will be open to you um so so you you have
39:17
to um desire to be corrected um I and I've that's a key for
39:26
my life of how I've been able to grow in wisdom and stay in God's will is like if
39:32
I'm unsure about something um you know it's just New
39:38
Territory maybe I have the fear of God I do not want to make a mistake I don't
39:43
want to step out of God's will I'm going to ask my spiritual father the question and he'll answer it and I've just found
39:49
like wow if I never if I
39:54
never um humbled myself to put myself in this place of
40:00
like I need wisdom I can't do this like on my own I I I I don't know this yet I
40:06
need the wisdom when I've put myself in that way then wisdom comes then it
40:15
comes I I've that's really a principle so it doesn't have to always look like
40:21
you asking the question directly sometimes it's you asking these questions on these lives that's why I do
40:26
these things this a big reason why God has me do this is in the area of Correction honestly like if sometimes
40:32
some you might ask a certain question like um that that you've been going the wrong way and but you don't know if it's
40:37
wrong or not and so you ask for clarity and then the correction comes simply
40:42
like that but it causes you I mean I mean but you need to be humble and put yourself out there like
40:50
show God I really don't want to be wrong I might be wrong in this area so correct
40:57
me if you need to that's when it comes is it unwise to eat food that may
41:03
have been used in idol worship today or would we be covered and protected by the
41:08
anointing and free to eat anything safely um when you go to any
41:14
restaurant I mean there's certain restaurants I wouldn't want to go to because they're
41:20
they just seem really dark maybe they have tons of demonic images I I just wouldn't choose to go
41:27
there but that's using wisdom it's not like holy spirit which place should I eat it's using wisdom that I've been
41:34
given oh that place looks dark I'm not going to go there I'm making the choice The Godly choice to not go there but for
41:40
the most part like most restaurants aren't like demonic like most aren't um I
41:50
mean by that I mean like witches are just like serving the
41:57
the food and like there's horror music playing and just demonic images
42:03
everywhere like most are not that way uh and therefore most are um safe to eat at
42:10
um because that's when when it's a neutral establishment um it's it's the food is
42:17
Sanctified as you eat it so um in general you don't need to be
42:24
thinking like is this food safe to eat or not that's that's really not on my mind like hardly ever like I just use
42:32
wisdom oh I'm not going to eat at that place cuz that place looks dark and I make the right Godly decision and I know
42:38
that the food is Sanctified as I eat it so in general you do not need to be
42:44
um worrying and putting lots of focus like
42:50
is this or questioning is this food safe or not the the main way that you need to be on
42:58
guard about the food you eat would be if someone is being really
43:03
manipulating um and someone possibly doing witchcraft uh on and wants to give you
43:12
food because um I mean I had that happen to me someone one
43:17
time um had impure motives towards me uh
43:25
as a woman and he brought
43:30
food to he brought like gift randomly to the church and it had food in it and it
43:38
was like pretty much all food like there was no other gift and for me it was like
43:43
I know just as an anointed servant of God I have to be more on guard when it comes to gifts um and especially Gifts of food I
43:52
that's just a principle because I know witchcraft can be done on food um and so for me it's not really wise to just like
43:58
accept food from anybody if they're personally giv it to me I'm not talking about going to a restaurant I'm talking about people personally just like
44:05
handing me food I just know that's a for me as a Ser anointed servant of God it's a different kind of um wisdom that I
44:11
have to have walk in that I've learned from my spiritual father and so um it
44:17
just didn't make sense for this person to be giving me this like it was just like it I felt weird about it it was
44:23
Holy Spirit speaking to me like there's something often weird about this for this person person that you don't know that well it doesn't really make sense
44:29
for them to be giving you a gift out of nowhere and the gift is food and I shared it with my spiritual father and
44:34
he said yes he put witchcraft on that as like a love spell like a love spell um
44:41
so uh threw threw that away I threw that away uh but anyways that's really that's
44:47
really more the area you need to be more aware of uh spiritually when it comes to
44:53
food is more of like someone that you feel fishy about giving you food I'm not
44:58
talking about friends and someone just being loving that you don't feel off about that's not trying to manipulate
45:04
you that you're not getting weird feelings about that's fine you don't need to give it a second thought but I'm talking about um when holy spirit will
45:11
speak to you there's something weird about this it's better to just not eat it can that be other gifts as
45:17
well yeah yeah if you're sensing a lot of manipulation from somebody and they
45:23
give you a like a lot of manipulation and bad feelings about somebody and they give you a gift then yeah it it's a
45:32
general principle it's wise to just you can throw it away it's not that you have to say no I will not accept it but in
45:37
your heart you don't accept it and you throw it away and you just speak I detach myself from this what happens
45:43
when you fail a test how to respond to it and does God give opportunity to rectify it well you look at the story of
45:49
David David majorly failed a test um
45:55
looking impure at the the woman that wasn't his wife
46:01
and then cheating on his wife and then killing his friend um the the the husband of that
46:08
woman as the woman was pregnant like so he made oh I mean he really massively
46:15
failed at this test and he was an anointed chosen servant of God um and he
46:21
was after God's heart it was spoken but in that moment he wasn't after God's heart so he made a moment where he stepped out of his true identity he
46:27
stepped out of who he really was and he made a huge mistake but we see God's
46:35
grace upon him we see how he wasn't be
46:41
because he failed that test he wasn't actually like Saul who failed the test too who failed the test as well he um
46:49
you know Saul the anointing left him he became oppressed with demonic spirits and he was taken off of it was removed
46:57
from the the place of King and replaced by David so we see two different things
47:03
happening completely they both fail tests but we see different results I mean different you know what
47:10
happened after was different for them so what happened with Saul was he wasn't repentant he wasn't humble he was um
47:17
still prideful he really wasn't that I mean his heart didn't change upon making that mistake when we make mistakes our
47:24
heart should really feel sorry and really feel sorry that we've
47:29
disappointed God that we've um you know instead of touching his
47:35
heart we didn't touch his heart we might have disappointed God and I don't if we see that we've disappointed God it
47:41
shouldn't be like this condeming feeling but it should just be like you know normal in life if you you know someone
47:48
you really love and you do something to harm them like they're not going to feel great about it right doesn't mean God
47:55
never condemns the one he doesn't want want us to condemn ourselves so but he wants us to really feel sorry so he wants us to see like what really
48:02
happened in the spiritual realm he wants us to see oh like I could have pleased God but I didn't I I I stepped out of
48:10
his will and I feel sorry not condemning but feeling genuinely feeling sorry and
48:16
we see David feeling so sorry we see just how sorry he really was and we see
48:24
he really truly repented he really was humble he really owned up to his
48:30
mistake and he really wanted to change he really didn't want to make that mistake again and some people
48:38
they they don't clean their hearts up they make a mistake and they don't really care they grieve God and they
48:45
don't really care and they just continue on they um May maybe May a make a kind
48:51
of fake I'm sorry to God but they it's not genuine from the heart and God sees the heart so those people are like Saul
48:58
so they failed the test and then they just stay stuck they don't they aren't redeemed they I mean
49:06
because they're choosing that I mean they they they they're they're missing the mark they are not able to walk in
49:11
their calling um and they may be reaping things of what they've done you know
49:20
um but we see David the exact opposite happened so David was genuinely sorry he really wanted to change
49:27
he truly truly repented and God accept that apology and
49:34
God gave him so much grace and God removed his past you know the Bible says
49:41
that we TR when we truly repent of our sins that God no longer remembers our sins that includes like when you should
49:48
have known better when you should have known better like you're not in the world anymore and you should have known
49:53
better and you make a mistake but when God God what when you really genuinely
49:59
like David apologize feel sorry say sorry and and and and take actions and
50:06
intentions to change to truly repent not just repent in word but repent in your
50:12
heart and repent in actions and humble yourself more when that happens God when you do
50:19
that God removes that sin that you did so and he gives you Grace and and so
50:26
d David we we find God blessing him and him walking in his calling again
50:32
stepping back into God's will after that David builds a temp starts making plans
50:38
for the temple um that Solomon would carry out and finish
50:44
but we see just this amazing Redemption upon him so that's how it is today
50:51
that's how it is today you need to reject condemnation and you need to truly truly decide to be sorry in every
51:00
way make be repentant um in your actions and in your words and really in your heart I thought
51:08
all of our sins Jesus forgave at the cross he did but if we choose to he
51:13
forgives our sins when we want to receive Jesus when we want to surrender but if we if you choose to live in the
51:19
world then the there's no you're not receiving the power of the Forgiveness of sins that Jesus brought if you're
51:26
choosing to step out of God's Will and not be humble and surrendered and
51:32
obedient then you're not accessing the power of the Forgiveness of sins when
51:37
you it all comes down to really giving your life to Jesus not this religious repeat after me prayer and that's it
51:44
true surrender to Jesus is where you access the power of the cross the power of the blood in every way so that
51:52
includes forgiveness of sins healing of sickness freedom fre from
51:57
oppression resurrection of death in your life from physical to spiritual and
52:03
abundance of life in every area so it's our choice if we will receive what Jesus
52:09
has done for us what is the difference between tithing and offering so tithing is 10% of your income that belongs to
52:19
God it's it's like if we don't give that we're we're we're withholding something
52:24
that actually already belongs to God but God actually wants us to see in our own free will that all of the money we are
52:31
given belongs to him meaning like that we wouldn't see it as like I earned this all on my own yes God 10% is yours
52:39
because you said so in your word but like the rest of it I this is my hard-earned money I'm going to do with it what I want I deserve it God doesn't
52:47
want us to be that way he wants us to be humble and be servant-hearted in every
52:52
way including financially to put others before ourselves in every way incl financially and to be humble and realize
52:59
that God is the one that gave us breath in our lungs to then be able to speak
53:05
and even have a job interview and the ability to have a brain and even write a resume and like he's the one he's the
53:12
only reason that we even got a job and so he wants you to be humble in that way
53:19
and be generous we're called to be generous we're called to be generous for his kingdom to give
53:25
to his kingdom and also to give to the needy those those who are in need so the tithes God wants to see it as like 10%
53:32
that belongs to God and then offerings can also so so I I I see it as this way
53:39
tithes is the 10% of your income that belongs to God that we must give to God
53:44
and then everything else is seeds is seeds or offering uh is just outside of
53:52
the tithes that you're giving on your own free will seeds that you're planted that you're planting in anointed ground
53:59
and it's going to bring harvest in your personal life and in the Kingdom so like when you give when you give and the
54:05
tithe also are seeds as well but the tithe is like is what we need to see is this is belongs to God and then then the
54:14
rest is is you and your own free will choosing to be generous um and so it's
54:21
you should have this mentality of I'm planting seeds so I'm planning this to contribute to God's work I'm planting
54:27
this this seed so that God can do more of his work God can do more flourish
54:32
conferences God can bring the worship team to be able to release anointed worship and people can be delivered
54:37
through the worship time at the flourish conferences so I'm planting this seed into the Kingdom so that the kingdom can
54:43
bear more fruit more fruit can uh happen in in the kingdom of God more people can
54:49
be saved healed and delivered from the seed that I'm giving and also that seed
54:54
is in my life too like that I plant here I'm going to have a reaping that returns back to me spiritual blessings spiritual
55:00
Financial blessings will come to me from planting the seed and I plant a seed here for a specific purpose over here
55:06
I'm believing for this breakthrough in my life some kind of miracle I need in my life I'm going to sew this seed specifically for this in this ground in
55:13
this anointed ground and I'm believing that that there's a reaping that's going to come directly from that seed that I
55:19
planted and then I'm going to plant the seed of Thanksgiving over here because
55:24
this seed is specifically just me thanking God for what he has done for me it's just pure Thanksgiving and that
55:31
there will be a reaping that comes from that where God sees your heart where that he can trust you with more because
55:37
you have this heart of gratitude and you've brought sacrifice um and so he will release more
55:44
to your life in the area of stewardship like he's seeing that you are you are stewarding what he's giving you well
55:50
through this seat and sometimes there's a certain
55:55
area of um like maybe you opened up a door to
56:02
the devil or you opened up the door unintentionally like you went out of
56:08
order you know you realize you you opened a door even if it was small I'm not talking about like this huge door of
56:14
like doing drugs or going to a psychic but I mean just like taking it seriously in the
56:22
spiritual realm where a misstep of like going out of order and you see that that
56:27
opened a teeny teeny little door even a teeny door um to the enemy and so you're
56:33
taking it seriously in the spiritual realm you're like I want to make a sacrifice upon this thing that I did I
56:39
want more of the anointing specifically for this area to rectify this in my life
56:45
not as like a I must do this like rule but um having that wisdom and revelation
56:52
of the power of the anointing and the power of sewing into the anointing that
56:57
the more you seow the more you reap so in an area where you need more of more
57:02
reaping you need more of the anointing and in some area you sow amen I haven't seen the fruit in
57:10
past churches like I do with tithing giving and sewing into 5f church do I need to renounce anything regarding
57:16
finances from giving into other Ministries in the past no you don't need to renounce it
57:24
but I would just say just in your prayer time with God just say like how you see
57:29
the difference and you're so grateful and and like how you have this desire
57:35
to redeem those seeds like where they could have been used more powerfully for the
57:41
kingdom sake and also in your own life how you have that desire to like how you
57:48
wish you could have taken those seeds you know and place it where the anointing is for example like just share
57:54
your heart to God that you have you know you have that desire you see the power
57:59
of of good ground and you have this desire in your heart to um SE more and
58:06
you know just share that with God in your prayer time and just carry that in your heart and throughout life and you know that
58:14
will lead to God opening up doors as you really carry that valuing in your heart
58:20
it'll it'll cause doors to open you know for for more provision to come because
58:25
what you are what you just spoke is showing that you value you know the fact
58:32
that you're really seeing the difference and having that Revelation that's really showing that
58:38
you you value and that's what God's looking for he wants to see like to pour out more anointing to pour
58:45
out more finances provision he he wants to see that you are mature you value you
58:53
are a wise person to invest in that you will be a good
58:58
Steward how do we get back into order if we feel like we've been pulled away just renounce renounce where you see
59:05
specifically where you want out of order and just renounce renounce that and just share share your
59:13
repentance to God you know be humbly repent and
59:19
um God will God will help you and that's an area you can sew a seed specifically for that like
59:26
Lord I need more of your anointing and Grace in this area I make a sacrifice not that you have to but just showing to
59:34
God I need more of you I need more of your anointing and I know it's free but
59:39
I want to make a sacrifice because it's not cheap I want to I want to Value it
59:44
you know um yeah that would be an area like I how I shared um when you've if you've gone
59:51
out of order in some way if you've opened even a little door to the enemy it's a wide to to make sacrifice to sew
59:58
upon that to reap more of that anointing in that area if a person really needed to undergo major surgery for him to get
1:00:04
better on a medical perspective but you have been declaring healing is it going against God's will to proceed with surgery no this is going to just depend
1:00:13
on the situation there can and it depends on faith and so like a person with like really strong faith that you
1:00:20
know they they believe I don't need surgery and they really feel strongly God has healed me and this is God's will
1:00:26
that I don't have this surgery then that's fine and beautiful for them to
1:00:31
not do the surgery and God will bring healing in most cases in that situation
1:00:38
of course there's always room for God to be mysterious his ways are not our ways
1:00:45
our real home is heaven and so um whenever death comes it's not as bad as
1:00:52
we make it out to be because our real home is heaven right so um there's a
1:00:58
general principle that God wants us to God wants us to be useful and bring his kingdom to this earth and so therefore
1:01:03
the general principle is that we would all live long lives so we can do as much that God wants us to do as possible amen
1:01:11
but we have to leave room for the mysteries of God where God just decides to bring someone home because that's
1:01:17
what Heaven is home it's truly home sooner than what we thought makes sense
1:01:23
so we always have to room leave room for that when it comes to Healing when it comes to Healing so I will not ever say
1:01:30
like God will absolutely always heal in this situation because we have to leave room for God being God and having his
1:01:37
ways that aren't something that's meant to completely understand per C it's just different with every person the reason
1:01:44
the purpose of someone dying earlier than we thought they should die or a
1:01:49
sickness not going right but there is a general principle I mean generally when
1:01:54
the faith is there when the faith is really there that healing will come when the anointing is there when the power of
1:02:00
God has been released because it's the anointing that destroys the Yoke so it's also very important to position the the
1:02:06
person where the anointing is um whether coming in person or online
1:02:11
um and many times God will lead you come in person you know that we can't just
1:02:17
like choose what's easier but sometimes God will really be speaking I want you to make a sacrifice and actually come in
1:02:23
person not that I can't move online and I do move online but in this situation I'm calling you to come in person so
1:02:28
there'll be those circumstances but then there will be other circumstances where a person's Faith isn't really really strong but they do have some faith and
1:02:35
so the healing isn't taking place fully through just supernaturally because the faith isn't at that level through the
1:02:42
faith isn't ripe and so there's nothing wrong with doing the surgery in that
1:02:47
circumstance um and God's grace can be upon that surgery and healing comes
1:02:53
still partly super natural hand of God but partly surgery that's that's okay
1:02:59
that's fine um and then like there's a woman that came to fifel church in March
1:03:07
and she had breast cancer she was 100 pounds and she could barely stand and I prayed for her and declared healing to
1:03:14
uh declared um cancer to leave her and
1:03:19
her friend who brought her just traveled from Georgia where she's from this past Sunday to testify
1:03:26
that her friend the next day after um I prayed for her she or two days later she
1:03:33
was then 120 lb supernaturally where she was 100 lb when she came on Sunday and
1:03:39
then the next day she walked 10,000 steps so she went from three days prior hardly being able to stand to having
1:03:45
this Supernatural strength and energy and then she had surgery recently I think she had surgery because I don't
1:03:51
know I don't know the full details like if she maybe she hadn't gone and done yet but she knew she was healed because
1:03:58
of this strength and the weight coming but she just decided to go through the
1:04:03
surgery and I don't know all the details of that but what I do know is that they went in to do a surgery I believe it was
1:04:08
recently like in may like earlier in May and when they went to do the surgery to
1:04:14
remove some cancer the cancer they couldn't find any cancer and so in that
1:04:20
that circumstance it was actually beautiful uh beautiful testimony like a
1:04:26
seed planted in the doctors for them to actually cut rope it like and then like see there's nothing there like that's a
1:04:33
seed planted to them so I share that because it's not like a specific rule
1:04:40
you shouldn't have surgery you shouldn't go through with this medicine it's all different it's led by the holy spirit
1:04:46
it's based on faith God's grace is there with everything we don't have to feel guilty or bad about it in terms of like
1:04:52
going through with medical procedures um God's not like against it or something like that or mad about it
1:04:59
you know when it comes to medical procedures um and it's it's just it's
1:05:05
different person by person by person so it's important to not be like religious about it but just understand God's grace
1:05:12
so yeah and I'm also thinking like some people they feel really led to throw away medicine and like that's when their
1:05:17
faith is ripe and God does want that to happen but like if you're throwing away
1:05:22
medicine based on condemnation like responding to the voice of condemnation and like not really Faith then that
1:05:29
healing might not happen that's why I say like it's not like this rule like throw away medicine just have faith
1:05:37
don't go to the doctor don't do this it's holy spirit's gentle and he's not
1:05:43
like mad at people for their faith Journey if if their
1:05:48
faith isn't here yet ripe to receive the miracle he's not mad about it and he's like we have to understand God's grace
1:05:55
and how he's gentle and how um everybody's story is different everybody's walk with God is different
1:06:03
amen and so if you know you yourself are on medicine for example and you see somebody throw away medicine um let that
1:06:10
inspire you let your faith increase in that but you don't need to feel this like weird pressure condemnation thing
1:06:16
to like immediately throw away your medicine like make sure you're using wisdom
1:06:21
you're rejecting the devil's voice of condemnation and you are letting that testimony be a prophecy to you rather
1:06:28
than letting that testimony be a voice of the devil to condemn you and force you because like the devil can when when
1:06:34
you go by condemnation it leads you away from God it doesn't lead you to God right
1:06:40
so like if you're doing things out of condemnation you're not even going to see the fruits of Jesus from it you're
1:06:45
not going to see like the healing come the miracle come the devil can use that like ah see you aren't good enough to be
1:06:51
healed or like speak lies through that that's why I say like
1:06:56
just be led by the Holy Spirit and use wisdom and reject the devil's lies and
1:07:03
don't ever go go by like don't be led by control of religious voices condemning
1:07:09
voices because it's not helping you even if it seems spiritual and Noble or something would this also apply to AA
1:07:16
and na I don't know what na is but AA I believe is Alcoholics Anonymous how does God say it for people whose eyes are not
1:07:22
opened up yeah well Alcoholics Anonymous like I know what an alcoholic synonymous that
1:07:28
they confess I am an alcoholic and that's like really
1:07:33
bad because that's literally speaking a curse over your life and and agreeing with the devil like like this is your
1:07:39
portion because what Alcoholics Anonymous I I think I think what they believe no offense to this organization
1:07:45
by the way but like but like I think what they believe is
1:07:50
um that like once an alcoholic always an alcoholic I think like it's a disease
1:07:55
that you just have to live with and then and so it's important to go to these support groups to like keep you
1:08:01
accountable and everything like that um and make you aware that this is the disease you have so this is why you
1:08:07
cannot have or you can't touch alcohol like it's it's it's really a wrong it's
1:08:13
not spiritual thinking at all you know um and so when God delivers you from a
1:08:18
spirit of addiction it's gone from you you are literally no longer an alcoholic now but you also have to have
1:08:26
that wisdom of you know though the Bible says don't get drunk it doesn't say you can't have a sip of alcohol it doesn't
1:08:32
say that but you should understand that you don't need that and whatever area
1:08:39
you had weakness before many times the devil wants to hunt you in that area um
1:08:45
and he can't get you as long as you're wise and you really keep that door shut so the wise thing to do when um person
1:08:51
has been delivered from addiction is even though that you don't have that addiction anymore forcing you to keep
1:08:58
drinking keep drinking or keep taking the drugs once you try one taste it's an area of danger that is more dangerous
1:09:05
than most people so it's the wise thing to do is to abstain completely from
1:09:10
it um and it's doesn't give any spiritual benefit to your life so why not abstain I mean drinking doing drugs
1:09:17
does not do any spiritual benefit in your life um so why what's what's the point you know so um anyways
1:09:26
so I it's not good to be confessing over yourself that this is who you are
1:09:34
um I don't know how that works if someone goes there and they have the spiritual truth and they they still want
1:09:39
to go to it but they refuse to speak it maybe that that could work but for the most part the main principle is we it's
1:09:46
not good to be speaking I am this but we can't force
1:09:52
people so if there's people there that you know that are going there the right thing to do is to just plant
1:09:58
seeds in their life if their friends or family plant seeds in their their life about Jesus and share your testimony and
1:10:05
what they're open to hearing Don't Force It on them and but if they open up more you can share with them what you've
1:10:12
learned the spiritual principles you've learned the power of your words and how
1:10:18
really Jesus his power is the answer not um like a support group that's not
1:10:26
spiritual that's not led by the Holy Spirit Jesus's Deliverance in your life
1:10:32
is the answer for um not being bound by alcohol again that's the answer so you
1:10:39
want to share that with them but not forcefully but gently when they open if
1:10:44
and when they open up to it what if my husband constantly says things like we are poor and so on uh well same
1:10:51
principle that I just shared if they're open to it gently share lovingly not like a harsh rebuke like stop saying
1:10:59
that you know but like gently lovingly share with them what you've learned about the power of your words and that
1:11:08
they're more powerful than you realize and we don't God doesn't want us to stay poor to stay in luck but we have to do
1:11:15
things God's way to get out of the lack and one of God's ways is to prophesy his
1:11:21
will over our lives and to refuse to speak what the devil wants to Devil's portion
1:11:27
and we have these spiritual Miracles already we have the inheritance from Christ already of Abundant Life in the
1:11:33
area of finances but the way we see it manifest is by applying God's principles
1:11:38
such as not speaking the devil's portion not speaking that we are
1:11:44
poor but um don't worry if they're not receiving it like you don't don't don't
1:11:50
be like worried if they're not ready to receive that I don't know like if they're rejecting if they're really not
1:11:56
open to receiving the the the new wine truth that you've received don't worry
1:12:03
but you know God's grace is upon you but you can do your part of renouncing that and speaking in your own private prayer
1:12:11
time these words that have been spoken that we are poor I reject them I
1:12:17
renounce that and I declare we have abundance in Jesus we
1:12:25
the poverty curse has been broken off our lives and I declare that doors will be open for us of provision in Jesus
1:12:33
name so counter you can counteract that so you don't need to worry like it's
1:12:40
um cursing you you know there's so much grace and you have power to to to combat
1:12:47
that my wife was set free from Demons by your prayers in Sydney how do I know if we
1:12:54
should be planted at 5f now I want to be in the new wine but feel needing community of local church not just
1:13:02
online yeah so this just depends on the person there's some people that feel
1:13:07
really strongly that they should only be planted online and that they should not go to other churches and I say yes and
1:13:15
amen when God is calling you to that and he's speaking you to that he's speaking that to you on purpose for a good reason
1:13:23
and it's really helping you grow and stay focused and not mix old wine with
1:13:29
new wine and not be confused and it's very important when when you're feeling that calling it's very important to
1:13:34
follow that but other people um maybe they're not feeling that calling or
1:13:39
they're not feeling that calling yet or also holy spirit is gentle in terms of
1:13:45
Transitions and everything you know um and so I know other people they consider
1:13:51
5f Church their their church that's where they're planted but they attend a
1:13:56
local church if they don't live in LA for example um but if if you're still
1:14:01
attending one it's important for you if you're still attending a local church it's important for you to know and make
1:14:07
the distinction and make the the the Covenant with God like this is where I'm planted like if it's 5f church this is
1:14:14
where I'm planted this is where I'm receiving from this is where the covering of
1:14:19
anointing upon my life is coming from this is my Elijah because you can only have one
1:14:25
Elijah you can only have one spiritual father Apostle Paul says this you may have many teachers but you only have one father and it's so important to make
1:14:31
that distinction and Covenant and make that real connection we have to be you know watch my impartation session the
1:14:37
impartation session of flourish under live streams releas two weeks
1:14:43
ago watch that because I teach a lot more in depth of that of this importance of really being planted and being
1:14:49
connected many people are kind of wanting to be like this with their Elijah and it's not working it's not
1:14:55
making the anointing flow in their lives there you have to be connected you have to do things right in the spiritual
1:15:00
realm for that anointing to really flow in your life um so it's important you make the
1:15:08
distinction you make the Covenant you make the decision led by the Holy Spirit like God is calling you to be planted here and
1:15:14
you'll know by the fruits and that's why I know this person asking this there's noticing the fruits so that's why
1:15:19
they're feeling the calling and that's correct that's wisdom that's Holy Spirit um for the most part when God leads
1:15:26
someone to be planted somewhere it's coming through wisdom as I taught on Wednesday um not necessarily so much
1:15:31
like Signs and feelings and but but wisdom which is where have I been transformed where have have I
1:15:37
encountered change where have I seen fruits in my life so for many people that's going to be look like look like Deliverance healing um eyes opening up
1:15:45
um uh breakthrough uh uh being brought closer to Jesus um being freed from
1:15:51
religion H encountering God's love and power like where you've seen like that's
1:15:57
God's main way of leading his people to where they're supposed to be planted is he'll speak through wisdom he'll speak through the fruits like where have you
1:16:04
seen the fruits when you where you've seen the fruits the most that's God
1:16:09
speaking that's wisdom speaking this is where you're called to be planted because it's just going to continue it's
1:16:15
it's God speaking already it's God prophesying already like what you've received it's that's going to keep
1:16:21
happening what you've received it's because of the great power there the anointing there that you need in your life that's going to lead to Miracles
1:16:27
breakthrough growth impartation so what you've received is prophesying into your future in both areas if you're where
1:16:35
there is not really anointing and you haven't seen a lot of change or growth or Miracles that's prophesying into your
1:16:41
future that that's how it's going to remain you know in your life so um know
1:16:46
where you're planted know where you're receiving from you have to know like this is where I'm receiving from because the new wine is rare
1:16:53
today um and so the Jesus says you can't mix old wine to new wine and this is no
1:16:59
offense or no fault for like many other churches but it's just that this is the end time Revival this is a new thing
1:17:05
that God's been doing and things always start small things start with a spark
1:17:10
and spread like a wildfire so like when John the Baptist came it was like just
1:17:15
it was just one person and then it spread to Jesus who was doing even greater than John the Baptist and then
1:17:20
it spread to Jesus and his disciples and then it spread um um to more disciples
1:17:27
but it starts with a spark so like we're more more in the season of a spark right now and then it will so it's like what I
1:17:33
mean is um a lot are not in the new wine
1:17:39
and so we have to be sensitive to that and have the fear of God and see the serious of this of once I found the new
1:17:45
wine I better hold on to it and I better take it seriously not mixing it with the old wine so if you are going to a local
1:17:52
church there's nothing wrong with that um if you are going to a local church physically um you have to be just uh
1:18:00
intentional uh you know making sure you're not getting confused with old wine that may be being released and also
1:18:08
be on purpose like no know like like the fruit like like if like if you receed
1:18:14
more fruits for example an anointing like Deliverance in your life planted somewhere else like a 5V for example and
1:18:21
then but you're going to a local church and you aren't really seeing Deliverance happen in your own life or in other
1:18:26
people's lives you need to know like there's so many people here who like me need a Deliverance they're in Bound
1:18:33
still and Jesus has come and has brought his anointing his new wine it's here it's available for them now and have
1:18:39
that heart um so you know gently lovingly even if it's just one seed
1:18:45
planted not like not forceful but like just in a conversation with a friend at that
1:18:50
church or something just sharing your testimony like I got delivered from all the and most likely that person needs
1:18:56
Deliverance too in some areas they need the anointing not most likely they do need the anointing in some areas of in
1:19:02
their life maybe even if they don't need Deliverance they don't have demons or sickness but maybe they're they've been
1:19:08
stuck in a rut they've been stuck in stagnancy in the area of finances or business or something you know or
1:19:14
relationships um they they need that light they need the anointing so so be
1:19:19
on Mission you know even if it's just small seed here there
1:19:25
gently um have that heart have that intention of why you're still um you
1:19:31
know going and also there's such an amazing online community um here at 5f church and also
1:19:38
be open to like sacrifice like if God is calling you to be planted fully online
1:19:44
if that's what God's calling you to um it is a sacrifice you know sometimes God
1:19:49
calls us to sacrifice good things that we enjoy right um God's isn't always fun
1:19:55
sometimes God's will is the most fun thing in the entire
1:20:01
world to me the flourish conference was the most fun thing in the entire world
1:20:07
so much fun you know Sundays are so much fun I there's no place I'd rather be I'd
1:20:12
rather be there than like this most uh Exquisite luxurious vacation or
1:20:18
something you know um but sometimes God's will is not fun so we have to we
1:20:23
have to walk in that wisdom um uh of knowing like oh just because
1:20:30
this is just because this is is usually seen
1:20:35
as a good thing and a spiritual thing and it's fun doesn't mean it's it's God
1:20:42
wanting me to do this in this season
1:20:48
amen hallelujah because whenever God calls us to make sacrifices for our good and many times we can't see it in the in
1:20:54
the in the time it never feels good it doesn't usually feel good to sacrifice it's usually uncomfortable it's hard and
1:21:01
we it's hard to see even the purpose of it lots of times but whenever he calls us to make a sacrifice to give up
1:21:06
something it's for our good it's it's leading to a great reaping a great increase beyond the joy and fun
1:21:14
of what we're having to leave behind how can I keep from tithing out
1:21:20
of condemnation like not out of gratitude but out of not feeling like
1:21:27
I'm tithing enough you you need to reject the voice
1:21:33
of condemnation reject the spirit of condemnation um and just pray to God
1:21:41
like Lord I want to really hear your Holy Spirit your Holy Spirit conviction and leading of what you want me to give
1:21:47
and to give generously um and sometimes like sometimes God is calling you to do
1:21:54
something and it's like conviction and condemnation are both there and it doesn't mean you're not supposed to do
1:21:59
that just because condemnation is there but what you need to do is you need to
1:22:05
reject the the spirit of condemnation like reading the Bible for example God wants you to read the Bible but there
1:22:11
can also be a condemning voice so so it's not that you shouldn't read the Bible um but you need to reject the
1:22:18
condeming voice and you need to go to God and really pray about this and just really be serious about it and if it's
1:22:24
really this hunting of the de devil on your life like you know it's just really a struggle in terms of your mind um take
1:22:32
it seriously getting freedom in this area by when you come to church online or in person bring this before God
1:22:38
renounce it and and as I shared again that principle of bringing sacrifice if there's a certain area where you need
1:22:44
more of the anointing in bring a sacrifice to God in this area name it out loud this seed is for this
1:22:50
breakthrough to be free of this voice of condemnation and like when you do something whether it's reading the Bible
1:22:56
or giving offering you know declare why you're doing it as you're doing it like declare like if you're battling the
1:23:02
voice of condemnation you know I am reading the Bible because God wants to speak to me now and he wants me to spend
1:23:08
time with him in his word and um I'm going to hear his voice as I read this right now and it's going to be a holy
1:23:14
precious time with the Holy Spirit right now this is why I'm reading the word and I thank you Jesus for speaking to me in
1:23:21
your word you know you're you're declar ing why you're doing it and you're making a stand devil I'm not listening
1:23:28
to you I am not following your voice I am not bound by religion this is not a
1:23:34
religious work that I'm doing right now this is led by the Holy Spirit you're making that
1:23:40
declaration and so you are you are rejecting the voice of condemnation as you do that and so now as you read the
1:23:46
word you won't feel that spiritual Pride that comes
1:23:51
with oh yeah I'm a good Christian today because I read the Bible and you'll be able to
1:23:57
hear holy spirit's voice speak to you thank you Jesus I declare right now for
1:24:03
more flourishing to occur in your life I declare right now that this is the
1:24:08
prophetic word that it is time to flourish we're going to keep flourishing
1:24:15
and flourishing you you are going to keep flourishing and flourishing it is
1:24:20
the time now remember this prophetic word that um we have exited we
1:24:26
prophetically have exited the roundabout and we have exited we've exited the
1:24:31
roundabout and entered the Revival way highway so we that means flourishing and
1:24:37
flourishing and flourishing and continuously flourishing and going glory to glory it's time now in this revival
1:24:45
and in your own personal life to keep flourishing it's time to expect doors to open it's time to ex it's time to knock
1:24:52
and be active and you know we can't the Bible says ask seek and knock and then
1:24:58
the door will be opened um there's a story in the Bible I spoke of a couple
1:25:04
uh not this year but the year prior um when I spoke of the prophetic word of the year and
1:25:10
um that the action was to take a step to see the Promise fulfilled and there's a
1:25:16
story in the Bible of these lepers that were about to die of salvation but then there was this city that you know they
1:25:24
could go into and believe God that they would get food and and blessing there but there was AR
1:25:31
there was armies there that could defeat them so it was like a risk like do we stay here and and definitely die of
1:25:37
starvation or do we um take a step do we try do we take a risk and believe in God
1:25:45
and and they could kill us because it's an army but God could protect us and so
1:25:50
we're going to take the step and believe God will protect us and defeat our enemies for us and God did Supernatural
1:25:56
things where he made the he supernaturally made it sound like a
1:26:02
scary sound like a huge Army was coming to the the people in that City and so
1:26:08
they left they left the town completely out of fear God caused it to happen and so then then they they they they went
1:26:15
the the lepers and then the rest of the Town went and there was food there was abundance
1:26:22
there and so not only did they survive but they flourished and so as we keep
1:26:28
going we don't just sit down but you know like as you took the step to come to the flourish conference as you took
1:26:33
the step as you took the sacrifice as you moved then things happened then the
1:26:39
Breakthrough came and the flourishing happened so this is what's going to
1:26:45
happen is we keep on moving on the Revival wave Highway as we keep being active for God as we keep on doing what
1:26:51
he's instructed as we keep on serving we keep on sewing we keep on contributing to the work of God flourishing
1:26:57
