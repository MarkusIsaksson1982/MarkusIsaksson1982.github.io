the title of this message this word that I have for you today is that God is raising the standard of Purity in the
0:06
body of Christ it's time that we raise our standard of Purity in the body of
0:12
Christ in our hearts so that the whole bride can be purified in this revival
0:17
This is the End Time Revival not just any Revival but the end time Revival and
0:23
in this end time Revival what God is doing is he is purifying his bride there
0:28
is going to be a huge transformation of the body of Christ so it's not like past revivals where it's more just like
0:34
Miracles and salvations happening but not like real lasting change it's more
0:40
just like Miracles happening Souls saved but this in this revival God is changing
0:47
transforming beautifying this whole structure of his church transforming so
0:54
many aspects of the Bride of the body of Christ because before Jesus returns we need to be beautiful and be prepared and
1:01
be ready and God has outlined in the book of Acts what the church should look like today how we should do Church how
1:08
the structure of church should look like how leadership in church should look like what Ministry looks like how to be
1:15
Servants of God it's outlined in in the book of Acts and we have veered away
1:21
from that a whole bunch in the body of Christ by and large so we gotta return back we gotta restore what we see in the
1:29
book of Acts and we need to go glory to glory so one of the big aspects that we
1:34
see in in the book of Acts that God is restoring right now in the end time Revival is
1:42
purity in the church purity of his bride Purity in the church
1:48
and for Purity to take place
1:54
in the body of Christ it has to start from the top and go down
1:59
it has to start with leadership Psalms 133 verse 1 says how good and pleasant it is when
2:06
God's people live together in unity it is like Precious oil poured on the head
2:11
running down on the beard running down on Aaron's beard down on the collar of
2:18
his robe a prophetic revelation of this scripture is this is how
2:25
the anointing flows through the body of Christ that you would come to a church
2:32
to where God is leading you to be where his anointing is his true church and God
2:38
appoints leaders of the church so that anointing there is that the head is in the leader
2:44
and like Elijah for example uh Moses Apostle Paul we have leaders here we
2:51
have these anointed Servants of God and then that anointing would flow down to
2:56
the rest of the body of Christ those who serve God under that leadership who come
3:02
to serve there it flows down is how the anointing is released
3:08
and so you know Paul he says
3:13
imitate me I urge you to imitate me Paul says
3:18
follow me as I follow Jesus and you don't hear that kind of
3:25
preaching today but this is how God transform and molds our heart and and
3:31
teaches us how to be a servant of God a vessel of God
3:36
um what being a real child of God looks like we we he he knows we need to see it
3:43
before us like we need to see it in the flesh and so what God did with Apostle
3:49
Paul is he raised up Apostle Paul Apostle Paul went before others and Apostle Paul had to pay a bigger price
3:56
for the anointing and to be in this position of the Apostle and
4:01
he was refined he was refined through the fire he was transformed so much into
4:07
the image of Jesus he looked so much more like Jesus Through what he went through and so now here's a leader
4:15
here's an example for others to look at for others to be able to follow so that
4:20
they can be truly how God wants them to be so they look at how they speak they
4:27
look at how they act they look at how Paul does these things they look at how
4:32
Paul ministers they look at how Paul speaks they look at how Paul responds how he responds to his enemies
4:39
they watch him they observe him and they learn from these from from him and his
4:44
teachings and as they can look and see this example this is what really helps
4:51
people uh be molded into the character of God and also
4:57
into God's heart God's character and also when they see somebody you know do hard things like
5:04
love your enemies uh humble yourself to the extreme
5:11
have just such intense compassion be selfless put put others before yourself
5:16
when they see this happening in another person
5:21
they can then see this is possible I guess I need to push harder I need to
5:27
Crucify My Flesh more I need to not settle but I need to raise
5:33
my standard it's possible if they're doing it and so number one it shows you it's
5:40
possible but number two it helps you like okay well what does being humble look like and then you see it in someone
5:47
like Apostle Paul and a leader uh what is being compassionate look like and then you see it in them uh you know
5:54
what is walking in authority to cast out demons like what does that look like when you watch and you see and
6:01
you learn like this is God's system of teaching us and molding us is that he
6:08
would raise up and anoint others to go before and be leaders and be ones you
6:15
can follow and imitate it's just how it works it's just God's
6:20
way it's just how it's done how God's system
6:26
of of beautifying us we can't do it alone we need the body we need we need others
6:32
um and it says in Ephesians 4 11 that God gave the apostles the prophets the
6:40
evangelists the pastors and teachers for the edifying the building up the equipping of the Believers
6:47
for works of service so that they would be no longer immature but there would be mature vessels of God
6:54
so we we know that this is how the body of Christ is built up how they are
7:01
equipped how they are matured how they are how they receive impartation how
7:08
they receive equipping to walk in that anointing that they received and how can
7:13
they can be powerful vessels of God it comes through God's system of the fiful ministry
7:20
of these leaders of church leaders this is God's system you know
7:26
um if you want to learn how to be a good spiritual son or daughter you look at you you know and and you go higher and
7:34
be able to walk in the anointing you look at Timothy and Timothy's instructions from Paul were imitate me
7:40
follow me as I follow Jesus you know so there's so much for us to learn there there's so much for us to learn there so
7:47
but but this is the thing in the body of Christ for a while
7:54
there has been not tons of purity
8:01
there has been abuse those in leadership
8:06
uh abuse abuse of several things abuse of the people uh spiritually emotionally
8:12
physically sexually um there's been
8:17
not Purity in the heart there's been people who are not anointed
8:22
by God but they appoint themselves and use their gift
8:28
and do it with a motive of not being in God's will but different bad motives
8:35
maybe to have a platform to have sex success to have Fame to have money
8:41
to have people follow them different evil motives this has happened this has happened a
8:48
lot and so many in the body of Christ have been hurt swimming in the body of Christ
8:53
you know have put their trust in leaders and then have been hurt by them and what's happened is the devil
9:00
understands God's system God's Church like how God's church should be
9:07
um the devil understands it full well and and he knows the power of when we
9:12
get in line with God's way of doing Church um
9:17
that's that's where we become very powerful in the kingdom when there's order when there's God's order God's
9:24
structure God's kingdom God's kingdom government uh you know can you imagine if the
9:33
country you're living in had absolutely no government or no leadership at all and
9:39
there was just none like none none at all uh it would be chaos every day there
9:46
wouldn't be laws and there wouldn't be people to enforce laws people could do whatever they want
9:51
without any consequences so it would be really like hell you know it would be
9:58
really chaotic and on top of that the country and the
10:04
people in the country would not prosper um because of that lack of order that
10:10
lack of government um and you know you you think about even America the the
10:19
country of America uh it's it's known to be you know a
10:24
great country to live in and and freedom and prosperous and a big reason why is because of
10:32
the the the democratic government that the people themselves the people of the
10:39
nation they they want moral good things for the most part
10:45
and so they vote and it's up to the people they vote who they want you know
10:52
in office and even when someone's not in the office
10:58
that you want a lot of people like in America are spoiled like they they they think things
11:05
are like the government so bad or something but if you go to a different country
11:10
you'll realize that we're spoiled that really we do have freedom that really
11:15
things are not so bad that they're pretty we're pretty blessed and
11:21
um you know though that there's evil there's always evil and everybody has free will on this Earth everybody has
11:27
free will in every nation and everybody has free will to do evil but the amazing
11:32
thing is that we don't have to uh indulge in that evil we don't have to be
11:37
forced that you've also had to be forced upon us but we can choose to live how we want we can choose to live pure we can
11:43
choose to worship our god um because of the freedom that we have
11:48
in that government and so when there's a government in place and a good government
11:54
then there can be peace there can be freedom and there can be prosperity
12:00
for the people in the nation too the actual people in the nation it's it's a big part of us having to do with
12:06
government so that's just to to to to kind of open your eyes about how government and Leadership how it's
12:12
necessary uh and how it leads to um of prosperity so for the kingdom of
12:19
God we want the kingdom of God to prosper we want the kingdom of God to advance and because so many people have you know
12:28
lost trust in leadership Church leadership
12:33
they've lost Hope they've kind of been like you know some people think that
12:38
there's no hope because they've they've been hurt several times that they're
12:45
either like I don't want to do church anymore or if they do go to church they
12:50
in their hearts aren't like respectful and humble
12:57
um and having servant hearts there in the place and to leadership
13:02
there um they're not having those kinds of Hearts but they're having more kind of
13:08
like prideful Hearts because it's like they're because of the hurt they've gone
13:13
through they're just seeing that no nobody's good nobody's gonna be a good heart you're you might hurt me too so I
13:20
I I'm just gonna just me and me and God you know that's
13:26
how a lot of people have become in the body of Christ today um and that's been a scheme of the devil
13:32
that's been a scheme of the devil because we need the kingdom of God we need the kingdom of God uh structure the
13:39
kingdom of God the government we need this this leadership we need as it says in
13:46
Ephesians 4 11 the apostles prophets evangelist pastor and teachers so if we don't have them then that means that we
13:52
in the body of Christ will not be built up it means we will stay immature we will stay like babies we will not be
13:58
victorious over the devil and we will not be powerful vessels of God why because this is simply God's system of
14:06
equipping us maturing us so we just simply have to get in line
14:12
with that so um that said in this revival God is
14:18
restoring Purity he's restoring pure leadership pure ministers
14:25
and in doing so he's going to be doing what we see in the times of Jesus and in
14:32
the acts Church where those who are chosen as Leaders those
14:38
who were chosen to be ministers they were the weak and foolish things as
14:46
it says in second Corinthians 1 26 brothers and sisters think of what you
14:51
were when you were called not many of you are Wise by human standards not many were influential not many were of noble
14:57
birth but God shows the foolish things of the world to shame the wise God shows the weak things of the world to shame
15:02
the strong God shows the lowly things of the world and the despised things and the things that are not to nullify the
15:09
things that are so that no one may boast before him so God literally chooses
15:16
these weak and foolish things because if you're not weak and foolish it's going
15:21
to be easy to boast before him if you are so confident in your giftings that
15:27
you don't need to really rely on God if you are getting so much Applause from
15:32
people from the beginning and just you know puffed up puffed up from the
15:37
beginning then it's going to be hard for you to give all the glory to God so God he
15:44
chooses the weak and foolish things the people that others would not expect just like King David was left in a field
15:53
his own father looked over him completely but he was the chosen one
15:58
because of his heart so all of the disciples that were chosen
16:03
they were unexpected they were not of noble birth they you know they didn't have Ministry in their history and they
16:10
didn't have some like charismatic speaking gift but they were fishermen they were Tax
16:16
Collectors they were normal people when the wisdom of the world's way would
16:25
have been to choose the Pharisees and the Sadducees that would have made sense
16:31
in the world's way so you know we've we've we've seen a Time
16:37
we've seen a time where it's been a lot of world's wisdom way those who are just naturally very gifted
16:45
end up being the leaders whether they're pushed into it because someone says your gift is amazing or
16:52
whether they inherited it like their family was in the ministry
16:58
so they have the connections or just the connections in general maybe it's the connections
17:03
uh this is what makes someone to be a leader in the past
17:09
as opposed to really being called by God really being anointed that's what's
17:15
happened a lot and and when you're not actually anointed to be somewhere
17:20
it's not good it's not good for you and it's not good for the Sheep
17:26
so this is where this impurity can come from because you were
17:33
not because one was not a not anointed for it and to be in this place of leadership
17:40
you have to be called by God you have to be prepared that's the thing about those who
17:47
disappoint themselves it's usually kind of easy for them and
17:53
there's no process from God when God calls one to be a faithful
17:59
minister to be in leadership God takes them through a serious process refining fire
18:08
God orchestrates it and God's the one that takes you through it
18:13
and you know it's not like you can you you want to call yourself to be a minister and you're just gonna like take
18:19
yourself through the process through a course or something nope only God can
18:25
orchestrate this and so it's that process that refines you perfectly so
18:31
that when you get into that place of God now is entrusting you with people you're
18:36
in a place of leadership you're a minister you'll be able to handle it you
18:42
will have a heart that God's proud of a heart that God is happy for people to imitate
18:48
and follow so um this Purity for it to happen the body
18:55
of Christ it must happen from the top down so now God is raising up pure hearted people right now who are truly
19:02
anointed to be leaders to be Apostles Prophets and evangelists and pastors and teachers
19:08
in the body of Christ but this message I have for you today is is
19:15
is is is a prophetic word from God to urging you to raise your standard
19:20
raise your standard of Purity for yourself raise your standard that you would want to be pure I'm sharing first
19:27
for you to know that number one that God is restoring Purity
19:32
into the body of Christ number two God is restoring his faithful Ministry
19:39
in the body of Christ we have to get in line with God's way of doing things we cannot do things our own
19:45
way anymore um if you've been hurt by if you've had Church hurt if you've been hurt by
19:51
Church leadership before God is going to free you today you're going to be free you're going to be healed and
19:58
you are going to be led by the holy spirit for that to not happen again and God is going to lead you he's leading
20:04
you perfectly for that to not happen again and God is showing right now he's raising up pure-hearted leaders in the
20:12
body of Christ and he's going to prove he's with him he's going to show the fruits in their
20:18
lives and what will happen is you will see the body of Christ will see
20:24
a big difference they will it'll be like water that they've longed for in a dry
20:30
place um like the Purity the the pure anointing that they receive
20:36
because of the purity of heart in the leadership because you know that anointing is released through Servants
20:42
of God uh that's God's way and as I as I was saying you know people want Revival
20:48
their own way they want Revival like past survivals they want to just gather in a room and we worship God and just
20:54
God does a whole bunch of Miracles and God can do that if he wants for sure but God has a system in which he moves in
21:01
power that's been lost by and large in the body of Christ for the most part how God moves in power is he releases
21:07
anoint his anointing in vessels and then his vessels release the anointing
21:13
but because people have been hurt by Church leadership they don't want to
21:19
receive Miracles that way many don't that number one and number two Pride
21:26
so we see this like resistance in the body of Christ where there are some that just want like Revival their own way
21:34
but but it can't happen this is Revival God's way Revival with
21:40
the faithful Ministry Revival with God's anointing where he pours out his anointing in vessels and we would do
21:47
what they did in the book of Acts where they position themselves like where Apostle Peter was ministering under where his shadow was and all were healed
21:55
the Bible says that's what God is doing now that's God's way that's how he wants us to do church that's how he wants us
22:02
to position ourselves to receive miracles that's what he's doing now so
22:09
um now we need to be open we need to be open to this God's way we need to be
22:14
open to um maybe if we hadn't before we need to be open to
22:20
planning ourselves in in his church in a church where the power of God is where
22:25
God is calling you to and being a servant there being a servant heart there and having respect you know and
22:33
respecting God's order respecting God's leadership and and being humble and and
22:39
being humble like I'm gonna follow who God's calling me to follow as they
22:44
follow Jesus like what what Paul said to do so we need to Humble ourselves be open
22:52
to this because this is how God is going to be able to transform the body of Christ transform you and mold you to be
23:00
a powerful vessel of God whom he can entrust with anointing
23:08
so he's raising up those impure Hearts right now the Bible says you shall know them by their fruits you shall know them
23:15
by their fruits the fruits means two things
23:20
this is this is number one that it that the
23:27
character of The Vessel of the servant of God would have God's character Godly character fruits
23:35
of the holy spirit that they would be humble that they would be patient that
23:40
they would be full of compassion that they would be selfless they would have a servant heart
23:46
that they wouldn't be boastful or prideful or selfish or lovers of money but
23:52
that they would really exemplify Jesus they would really be representatives of
23:58
Jesus and so um the way you can know those kinds of
24:05
fruits in Servants of God is to get in the word you need to get in the word of God
24:11
yourself you need to get in the word of God yourself because you can go to a church and a preacher
24:18
can say this is what humility looks like this is what
24:23
you know love looks like but they're just preaching their own
24:29
thing you have to get in the word of God yourself and you have to study Jesus you
24:36
have to study how the Servants of God were who he chose what their what being
24:43
christ-like looks like look at who Christ is like and then look look at
24:48
how Paul showed it was possible Peter showed it was possible to be christ-like
24:54
look at the comparison of David how when he did wrong okay this is what's wrong to do but this was the right way but
25:01
this was the he was a man after God's Own Heart he put all his selfish Ambitions aside
25:07
and he just wanted God's will the word of God will teach you to be able to discern
25:14
real fruits real character fruits so that
25:20
when you're looking at the fruits it's not about the person teaching this is this this is this but you see the
25:27
humility in them you see the Purity in them you see the compassion in them you
25:33
see their faith in God in them you see the selflessness in them you see
25:40
the Purity completely in them you need to be in the word of God to be able to
25:45
see and then number two the fruits are the
25:51
fruits that we're looking for is the workings of the spirit in their lives
25:57
the signs all who believe these signs shall follow them for example Healing The Sick casting out demons
26:06
so we should in their Ministry you should be seeing people be healed people be delivered people being saved people
26:13
being transformed so you should see testimonies of people that they really
26:18
haven't transformed they really are free that's what it means to look at the
26:24
fruits you shall know them by their fruits this is the next thing this message today is about
26:31
urging you to desire Purity in your own self
26:37
desire that you would be pure in heart this is surprisingly is something that
26:42
many people don't desire after
26:47
they desire God's will but they don't realize that means you also have to desire purity
26:54
they desire to to be used powerfully by God but they don't realize that means you need to also desire Purity in your
27:00
heart God is urging this is what God's doing
27:06
he's restoring Purity in the body of Christ but we have to want that for that to really happen
27:11
and so he is asking you will you desire for me to make you pure
27:17
for your heart to be purified
27:24
a big part of your heart being purified as I shared before is coming to a church
27:29
where God's power is and you know Finding like a Paul you can imitate after that's a big big big big part of
27:36
how you're going to be purified so after you have decided that that you
27:42
want to be pure you know you need to make sure you are planted in the right place
27:48
or otherwise you will if you if you if the person who is leading you is not pure you will you
27:55
cannot be pure and you know what happens in the body of
28:01
Christ is that there's a lot of people who don't desire purity
28:09
so they follow people who are not pure because
28:14
they don't desire purity it justifies their actions it gives them permission
28:19
to continue in their ways it gives them can it gives them permission to to remain impure
28:28
that's why some people they aren't gravitated to the Pure Heart like pure hearted Ministries
28:35
it's too uncomfortable for them they in some cells they don't want to change
28:41
it makes them uncomfortable so they go someplace else that makes them more comfortable these are areas of
28:47
Christians that many people they don't want to change these things they don't want to leave their Love of Money
28:55
they don't want to leave their Love of Money so
29:00
you know sometimes there will be leaders who they still have Love of Money
29:07
even if they're preaching and they're saying I don't care about money at all
29:12
you know and I give this I give that I don't care about money at all but if you
29:17
can see in the spirit you can see there's a love of money there you know
29:24
um but they're people that have that in them they're Christians that have that in them and then they see that and
29:30
they're like oh I don't have to give this up it justifies it for them
29:39
and there's a lot of people that a lot of Christians also they do not want to give up
29:46
Pride that's the big one they don't want to give up their ego
29:53
they don't want to give it up and so they'll be following certain
29:58
people and then certain their leaders will not respond to situations humbly God
30:06
will show you the real fruit in a person like the fruit of humility for example
30:11
and sometimes it can take a little bit to see it sometimes God will cause a situation to happen
30:18
friction to happen pressure to happen where the true character comes out so the friction Com when the friction
30:25
comes against the pride the pressure comes against the pride that's inside it can't be hidden anymore
30:32
but if there's humility and there's not pride and the friction comes against it there's there's no Pride there so what
30:41
gets exposed is actually the pure heart that it's even pure pure than one new
30:49
um friction pressure is a good thing to
30:56
to um be persecuted and attacked to be falsely
31:01
accused is a good thing for us believers why because those are the only things
31:09
that tests are Pride and that get the pride out
31:15
if it's there and refine our humility
31:21
like you know with Joseph he was thrown in a pit to die he was
31:28
thrown in a prison after being falsely accused of um this woman said he tried to sleep
31:34
with her like that was horrible about what was done to him and he didn't deserve it in the least in fact he was
31:41
so favored by God he was favored by his father it's because he had a Precious Heart Like David he he had a precious
31:48
heart for God that's why he had this this coat this beautiful coat that his
31:53
brothers didn't like there was something special on his life it had a special heart for God and so he was like the
32:00
last person to deserve these things that he went through um but the beautiful thing I love about
32:07
the story of Joseph is that we don't hear him complaining much we don't hear him whining
32:13
I mean at all really and we actually see him still serving God in the prison he's
32:18
still like being a vessel of God to the people who were in prison with him and
32:23
um then God raises him up God does it on his own he doesn't have to defend
32:28
himself he doesn't try to defend himself but God lifts him up on his own
32:34
and you know you think about you you think about the story of Joseph and that
32:39
was really humbling like even though he was you know humble before he had a good heart it was it humbled him even more
32:45
I mean when you're in the when you are in the place of the pit in the prison and falsely accused and you choose to
32:51
not complain it literally changes your heart like it God changes your heart through those
32:57
circumstances where it's just kind of this moment where you're like
33:03
well who am I to deserve anything I'm blessed to have breath in my lungs
33:09
in a relationship with God that right there is like more than a million bucks so
33:17
you know I trust God God's allowing this for a reason
33:22
and also I don't care about my reputation because I'm not called to have a good reputation
33:29
I'm just called to serve God so you know this lady made up a lie about me but
33:36
it's okay I don't care what people think of me God will vindicate me and above
33:42
all I'm I'm not supposed to care what people think and try to prove that I'm
33:48
right you know that's God's job God will be my Defender the Bible says just be still
33:55
and let God fight for you like God Be Your Defender let God Be Your Vindicator it's his battle not
34:01
yours so anyways you know you doing that kind of thing you you walking with God in
34:08
that it molds you to be humble more humble more humble
34:14
and I've learned that I've learned these things that God took me through I've learned these I mean these false
34:20
accusations that have been spoken against me in my past and and even every day really
34:27
um and the persecution and the evil things done to me evil things done to me by fellow brothers and sisters in Christ
34:32
and leaders and leaders um the evil things have it done to me like it has truly made me more
34:39
christ-like it has truly made me more humble um it's only been a blessing in the long
34:48
run because of how I've been able to be changed in my heart and that's the
34:53
greatest gift to be able to be more like Jesus and to be able to be used by his
35:00
anointing more because you've been transformed more and he can entrust you with more that's the greatest gift in
35:07
the world and so that's why God allows these things so you when you in hindsight you're like God you're so good
35:12
for taking me through the rough times you know God you're so good
35:18
but um you know sometimes people don't want to give up their
35:25
reputation they don't want to give up that ego they they really want to be seen as
35:31
great in in man and woman's eyes and they don't want to be taken through a time of having
35:39
a bad reputation like like Joseph had a horrible reputation God allowed that he
35:45
didn't deserve that Joseph was sitting there in the prison and the word around town was that he tried to sleep with
35:51
that woman that was his reputation for a little bit some people don't want to sit
35:57
sit in that prison but we got to some people don't want to sit there and and
36:02
let people think bad things some people do not want that some people
36:07
can't take that and that's the those are the times when you see people defending themselves and
36:15
you see a fence coming out um and you see you know trying to prove
36:21
oneself but these are all things that we're not supposed to do we're supposed to just be still on that godfighter
36:27
battles for us and weird and to like you know defend
36:32
oneself isn't very humble you know we're supposed to be humble like it is what it is you know
36:39
like I'm just gonna let God take care of it I'm gonna let God take care of it and
36:44
people will think what they want but it's okay I just want to please God that's what I'm focused on and I know
36:51
he'll vindicate me that's what we're called to do so sometimes
36:56
you know people will follow after others whom you know they don't want to let go
37:02
of their ego they don't want to let go of their pride and when situations come they're always you know defending
37:08
themselves or you know speaking against their enemies rather than
37:14
loving their enemies as the Bible says the Bible says you know
37:19
turn the other cheek if you're if you're hit you know give
37:24
then the clothes on your back when they ask you for it like that we're called to love our enemies
37:30
and so these are the hard things though these are the hard things that that people don't want to do they don't want
37:37
to give up that ego and the pride and so what happens is according to what you
37:43
don't want to let go of in your heart you will follow a leader that's like you
37:49
that that that's like that so that you can be justified and you can you can
37:56
stay and you can be in a delusion even thinking like this is the christ-like way to be because my leaders doing this
38:05
you know so I people also love
38:10
they love giftings they they can idolize giftings like
38:16
a gift to speak really well and Charisma people can end up idolizing after that
38:23
and so that they follow um Leaders with a gift rather than
38:29
following where they're actually where they will actually be transformed more into the image of God and where God's
38:36
calling them to be so it's like you follow where you want to what what you want
38:43
um people like to be entertained and so sometimes people they go to a church based on I'm entertained here and I'm
38:50
doing my good Christian thing here they you know they might have pushed it in the back of their head that that's
38:55
the real motive but deep down that's the real motive
39:02
second Timothy 4 3 for the time will come when people will not put up with sound Doctrine instead to suit their own
39:08
desires they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear
39:17
that's what I'm talking about right here the people will not put up with sound Doctrine so in other words the time will
39:24
come so they don't want to be called higher they don't want to hear the doctrine that
39:32
brings Purity and Holiness and humility so instead to suit their own desires
39:39
their own desires that they have whether it's to be entertained another one is uh
39:46
you know deep preaching or like sounding deep
39:51
sometimes one can sound so you know how they speak they can have a certain way
39:57
they speak that sounds very deep and it can make a listener's feel
40:03
like they're getting that they're becoming so so so so so so so so
40:09
spiritual when in reality it's it's just the um
40:16
presentation or Charisma or way something is coming and really God might
40:23
want you to just be having meat but meat that is simple that will feed you that
40:29
you will really understand and will transform you rather than things sounding deep but
40:36
it's really not what God wants you to be eating that will actually transform you
40:42
as uh First Corinthians 2 verse 1 it says Paul says when I came to you I did
40:49
not come with eloquence or human wisdom I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I Proclaim to you the
40:56
testimony about God for I resolve to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified so that
41:03
your faith might not rest on human wisdom but on God's power and so we see
41:09
this correct way of preaching not that eloquence is bad you need to be clear in
41:15
your speaking you need to have decent vocabulary for you know it's not that
41:20
the eloquence is bad but it's when the eloquence is the focus the Deep sounding
41:27
is the focus or the um getting a rise out of people the hype
41:35
it's when that is the focus when you start to become more of an Entertainer or one that
41:42
wants people to really be pulled into what they're saying wants them to clap
41:48
you know rather than you know what our heart should be is I want them to have
41:54
an encounter with God I want them to to grow with what is released here and
42:01
that's the only motive there's no other motive there's no other motive at all that's their focus that's their heart
42:08
back to the scripture about the itching ears they will suit their own desires so they will go where their ears want to
42:15
hear what they want to hear and they will gather around them a great
42:20
number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear
42:25
some other areas that people don't want to give up like Christians don't want to give up many times so I've mentioned
42:31
Love of Money many Christians don't want to give up and also ambition
42:36
selfish ambition goes along with that um Pride
42:42
people don't want to give up judging others that's a big one people many times they do not want to give up
42:49
judging others whether it's just like pointing fingers at someone in a religious way like look
42:56
at their sin or be not loving to your enemies whatever the judgment is
43:04
they don't want to get rid of that so they'll find leaders that have that
43:11
judging spirit you know um we say hate hate the sin hate the sin
43:18
Love The Sinner but I I think there's one thing
43:25
people get so obsessed on the evil of people's sins and don't Focus so much on how people
43:34
will really be saved they put so much energy on their hate for the evil sin
43:40
that people are doing and they don't realize that when you're putting all your focus on the hate of this sin
43:47
and doing nothing about the the sinner like showing no love showing no
43:53
attention showing no heart for them to be saved you're just you're just you're disgusted and you're gross that they
43:58
would do this sin we see this a lot in this month um
44:03
of like pride month it's like there's so much disgust for the sin but they put all their energy there and
44:10
then the sinner doesn't be changed they don't they're not led to Jesus that way by by the outrage of the sin by the
44:18
focus of only the outrage of the sin the Bible says the kindness of God leads to repentance and so we need to be loving
44:25
to the sinners we need to stop focusing so much on the sin we need to understand that there are
44:31
demons behind that sin and so we need to not be so focused on like ah Damon sin
44:39
evil this world is evil this country is evil oh that's like
44:45
that's like me ministering and you know seeing all the demons manifest and just standing there and be like ew you demon
44:52
you're gross ew you demon I can't believe you making this person do that
44:58
ew can you imagine can you imagine but what happens you you know you don't you
45:05
don't give any attention to the demons you don't let them speak be quiet Jesus would say be quiet leave them you don't
45:10
give attention to the demons you know demons are evil it's not brain science it's not you know demons are evil demons
45:17
make people do evil things people need to be saved and need to be set free and need to be shown the true love of God
45:24
the true the true person of Jesus is people need to to see him revealed
45:30
through you that's what people need not to obsess over the demons in them and
45:36
obsess over the evil that the demons are causing them to do so what do we do we preach with love
45:44
we release the power of God we command the demons to go
45:51
and we speak blessings over the people and we share the love of God with people
45:57
we tell them Jesus just freed you because he loves you your past is wiped away he's forgotten
46:04
your sins your new creation we need to be demonstrating God the
46:10
right way so that people the Sinners can come to Jesus Through us if we're a church
46:18
who is obsessed with the evil and the sin and obsessed with what demons are
46:23
doing the Sinners are not going to be drawn there the kindness of God leads to repentance we need to be showing the
46:29
kindness of God so that people can actually repent actually be saved
46:35
that's what will draw them I love how we see we see we we saw last Sunday a gentleman
46:43
come and just be so hungry he actually got my attention he's like can I renounce like he was so hungry to be
46:49
free I posted the video of this a few days ago a couple days ago he renounced homosexuality transsexuality
46:56
first things he renounced and he was so hungry to renounce these things and I just thank God so much that
47:03
that he has made our church faithful church the church I Pastor in LA a
47:09
lighthouse a lighthouse shining out for those for the Sinners
47:16
out there who are lost who have demons for them to know that there's a God who
47:22
loves them and can free them and that they are not an evil person but
47:27
they have evil in them that God wants to free them from and God will make them new and I'm just
47:34
I'm so thankful to God that he's you know shown our light made our light to shine so people can come hungry in the
47:42
front row and have to get my attention because they just so are so hungry to be free and so unashamed to renounce such
47:53
things that so many Christians would judge but that they would feel so
47:59
unashamed to announce because of the love that's shown here the love that's shown there that they know they're safe
48:05
there and they're loved and they're not judged there so anyways there's a big part of
48:11
Christians many Christians that love to judge and they really want to hang on to that
48:16
judgment so they'll find leadership where they have that judgment
48:21
and it makes them Justified and so they they think it's they they
48:27
judge even more you know Wheats and tears grow together as it says in Matthew 13 24 this parable about the
48:35
Kingdom of Heaven is like a man sowed good seed in the field while everyone was sleeping his enemy came and sowed
48:41
weeds among the wheat and went away when the wheat sprouted and formed heads then the weeds also appeared the owner's
48:48
servants came to him and said sir don't you sew good seed in your field where where then did the weeds come from
48:56
an enemy did this he replied the servants asked him do you want us to go and pull them up no he answered because
49:02
they're because while you were pulling the weeds you may uproot the wheat with them let both grow together until the
49:08
Harvest at that time I will tell the Harvard sisters first collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned then gather
49:14
the wheat and bring it into my barn so they will grow together
49:21
and so you know this message is a prophetic word right now in this revival
49:26
for you to know that not Everywhere You See
49:33
Deliverance happening Miracles happening it doesn't mean that there's
49:39
Purity there doesn't mean that there's Purity and Leadership there
49:44
um there are going to be different different kinds of
49:51
leaders some might have this the Judgment that there some might have the
49:56
pride there some might have Love of Money there so be aware of that you know don't just
50:04
blindly follow anyone and follow tons of people this is why we're this is one of
50:10
the big reasons why we're not called the follow tons of people but to be planted in one place what's very important is to
50:17
look for humility look for Purity look for humility look for holiness as important as the Miracles are
50:25
it's it's just it's it's even more important that the Purity and the Holiness is there too the humility is
50:33
there too this is being in the right place being under the right leadership is going to
50:40
help you is going to be what's gonna equip you to be a powerful vessel of God with a pure heart you have to desire to
50:48
want to change you have to desire to want to be corrected by God
50:54
you have to desire to get uncomfortable you have to desire that you're that you
51:01
want your heart to be a lot different you want your heart to change you have to desire to to give up these things to
51:06
give up the selfish ambition to give up the pride to Give Up the Love of Money whatever it is
51:12
you have to desire this and when you desire this you'll be able to see
51:17
you'll be able to see in the spirit and see where God is and see where where the humility where the Purity is
51:26
