I taught a message free from the spirit of religion part
0:06
one and what and today will be a part two
0:11
and we are doing a deep dive into learning about the spirit of
0:18
religion what it is this is meaty today this is really a teaching today
0:25
um for you for your eyes to be opened up in the spiritual realm to know what the spirit of religion is to discern it
0:33
to see it in you if it's in you in any way so you can be free of it to see it
0:39
in other people so you won't be deceived by the doctrine by the words that they speak
0:45
so that you can fully discern when it is coming and moving and trying to attack
0:50
you trying to bring you away from God's will because this is really important
0:56
this is so important this is like what probably the most important uh demonic
1:02
spirit for you to know about to understand because this is the devil's I would say it's the
1:11
devil's favorite uh scheme and spirit to try to dismantle the body of Christ and
1:19
God's work I would say it is the very most poisonous spirit
1:26
of all more poisonous than witchcraft more poisonous than uh the spirits that
1:33
come from being in the worlds like addiction
1:39
because it's the spirit that goes undetected
1:44
most of the time it's the spirit that Christians do not
1:50
know they have it's a poison in them that's killing them that's leading some to hell
1:56
that's that's keeping them from knowing God's love and it what it does is it doesn't just
2:03
destroy them but it destroys everyone around them because it comes out of them like poison
2:12
and it's the sneakiest one it's very sneaky people do not understand it people do not I mean Christians have a
2:19
hard time understanding that having a hard time seeing it by and large because it's honestly such
2:25
a big part of the body of Christ like like so many people have the spirit
2:31
of religion or are being influenced outwardly by the spirit of religion it's
2:38
so widespread that people don't know what it is because it's like well how
2:43
how could it be so widespread how could something so poisonous and dangerous be so widespread so people just think it's
2:50
normal they don't know it's poison they don't know it's the devil they don't know it's the Pharisee
2:57
spirits it's that thinking of you know the times of the Pharisees they were the religious
3:03
leaders of that day the the Jewish people of that day the people of God of
3:08
that day the people of God of that day which included Jesus Jesus was going to the temples
3:15
as a kid he was going to the temples he was learning the Torah so if you were a person of God you were
3:23
like looking up to the Pharisees it was so widespread the spirit of
3:30
religion the Pharisee Spirit they're two in one Pharisee spirit Spirit of religion
3:35
so it was so widespread that people could never think what poison these
3:41
spiritual leaders carried these spiritual leaders that they were learning from these spiritual leaders that even Jesus was in the temple from
3:47
Temple he was reading the Torah one time among these spiritual leaders that
3:54
carried poison and would one day kill him be the reason he was killed so that same spirit is alive today it is
4:03
so prevalent in the body of Christ today and when we say Revival is now a big
4:10
part of that means that God is destroying his religious spirit he is removing it out of his people out
4:17
of his bride just as Jesus came and he came in a
4:22
different way completely free of religion this is the way this isn't the
4:28
way all you Pharisee way that's not the way at all it's it's gone this is the
4:33
way so in the same way Jesus is coming again now this is the way and the truth and
4:41
the life this religious way is not the way in the truth and the life it's a radical transformation that's happening
4:46
in the body of Christ now amen so you know it's like you you right
4:54
now are in the front lines of the end time Revival your army uh and it's like like Jesus he
5:02
he called his disciples they were pure they were childlike they were not Pharisees right they were regular people
5:10
they were a blank canvas so they wouldn't be carrying that old wine old
5:16
wine skin they didn't have the old wine skin so they they could really adopt
5:21
Jesus's ways Jesus's teachings so that they could then spread his word spread
5:27
his message and spread his kingdom to the world that's you now
5:32
that's you in a world of so many Pharisees in a world of so much religious spirit everywhere in the
5:39
church God is raising up you to be the pure disciples like the the 12 disciples
5:45
of Jesus completely free of religion and pure
5:52
and you're coming to proclaim the real truth the real Heart of Jesus
6:00
to Proclaim Grace
6:05
so in order for you to be like this this pure disciple free of religion you have
6:11
to understand what the spirit of religion is you have to try to find it in you find it in yourself and get it
6:18
out my people perish because of lack of knowledge people are perishing because
6:24
they lack knowledge of what the religious spirit is and that they have it so they're they're able to get rid of it
6:31
but when you have knowledge and your eyes are going to open up today you'll be able to see even in yourself how it's
6:36
influenced you or if you carry it actually you need Deliverance you'll be able to see it and recognize it and say
6:43
Lord I don't want it I renounce it I want to be free I want to be pure I want to be clean I want to be religious
6:49
free and then when the spirit of religion comes and accuses just like this the
6:55
Pharisees accused Jesus when the spirit of religion accuses your Jesus today here and now moving in the anointing in
7:02
the power you will have eyes to see that's the religious spirit I'm not
7:08
listening to that that's not truth I don't care what kind of degree they have what kind of position they have how
7:14
popular they are how good of a Preacher they are I don't care I see that's the religious spirit and I will not listen
7:21
to that I rebuke that amen so this is why we are going so in depth
7:28
today for you to understand what this is so the spirit of religion is vast there's so many different components to
7:35
it like a lot you might you might have heard a lot of time oh that's religious oh the spiritual oh that's religious oh
7:41
religion but you don't really know exactly what it is it actually is complex there's so many parts to it uh
7:48
last week I really just went over one aspect today I'm going to go through a
7:54
lot more I went over this one aspect which is really the root of everything else that you will learn today all the
8:00
other aspects and and to summarize that for those of you that weren't here last week if you didn't see the message make
8:07
sure you go back on my YouTube channel and 5f YouTube channel um and you'll see it posted on the
8:13
videos there under live under live what I spoke on last week the first
8:18
the first part of the spirit of religion is the idea that righteousness is based on
8:24
works and not Grace when the opposite is true your righteousness is because of
8:30
God's grace and you receive it by faith so you believe that Jesus is your lord and your savior and that he has removed
8:37
all of your sins so you do not work to remove the sins Jesus has already done it so you simply believe that Jesus is
8:43
Lord and the sins go all away um and so people with a spirit of
8:49
religion they understand that I mean they hear that yes I know that they hear it they they kind of get it but this but
8:57
they s the spirit of religion in that way of works is coming in other ways and
9:03
they're not realizing it's the same thing it's like the same thing as uh uh
9:08
you're not receiving God's grace so what I mean is you know you read the
9:13
Bible and you pray and you do all these religious things
9:18
because you think that's what's going to make God happy with you and when you go to read the Bible when you go to pray
9:24
you do it just to do it to check the list off check off the list of things you need to do to be a good
9:30
Christian things you need to do for God to be okay with you for you to feel good about yourself and for other people to see
9:36
you're a good Christian rather than you do these things because
9:41
you want to spend time with God because you want to hear God's voice when you pray you should pray genuinely from your
9:48
heart not reciting religious prayers but genuinely from your heart and you should
9:54
pray all day pray at all times you should include God all the time speak in your own language be real
10:00
and have communion have communication desire to hear God's voice desire to
10:06
hear him speak Direction in your life desire him to correct you you should read the Bible
10:13
to hear God's voice not to say you finish the Bible
10:19
in a year or something and not to say okay I've read a few chapters today I did good
10:25
I'm knowledgeable about the Bible I can teach this Bible study now I know
10:30
it but instead you read the Bible whether it's a verse whether it's three chapters you read it that day to hear
10:38
God's voice to commune with him to spend time with him that's the heart and motivation behind it okay so that's what
10:46
relationship with is that's what intimacy is but the spirit of religion the works-based part of it
10:53
Works based on Works salvation based on Works righteousness based on works that has
10:59
seeped in people's minds where they're living religiously in the works area
11:07
rather than in intimacy and relationship and in Grace they uh if they misreading the Bible one
11:15
day they condemned themselves they hear the spirit of condemnation that comes with a spirit of religion
11:20
condemnation rather than if you if you're free of religion you hear you don't hear that
11:27
you you hear you you just hear God's love and his grace and and probably it's probably a
11:34
situation where the Holy Spirit moved in a different way that day maybe he had a lot for you to do for work for him so it
11:40
the Bible reading looked different that day not as much that day something like that and so you don't hear condemnation
11:46
you only hear conviction conviction or just God's love and grace
11:51
depending on the situation amen so that's part number one of what the
11:56
spirit of religion is is that it's based on works and if you don't do the works you hear
12:05
this hear condemnation the spirit of religion speaks condemnation
12:10
so the second part
12:20
the second part of this is of the spirit of religion is
12:28
that when you start living this way it pushes you from God
12:36
it makes you farther away from God instead of going closer to his heart you're not thinking what is he saying
12:42
how can I please him what is he saying what is Holy Spirit speaking today you're not hearing any of
12:47
that you're thinking you're doing uh Christianity on your own terms Christianity becomes an idol
12:55
instead of Jesus being your Idol Christianity meaning like reading the
13:02
Bible praying The Works having position in the church
13:08
not not drinking not doing drugs doing everything right that becomes an idol
13:18
the rituals and the rules of Christianity becomes the idol
13:25
instead of Jesus Jesus is left out and so what happens is people end up
13:31
being fake their heart is far from God
13:36
but on the outside they look like a perfect Christian that really loves God
13:43
they're fooling themselves and they're fooling other people
13:48
and because you're far from God and you're not accessing his grace and his Spirit you're not being transformed into
13:54
His Image not only is your heart far from God but there's no way you can live righteously there's no way you can live
14:00
a pure holy life this is why one of the big reasons
14:05
there's there's so much sin in the church there's sin in leaders lives
14:11
because their hearts are far from God because they have the spirit of religion
14:18
so they start sleeping with people quietly but everything else they're doing is perfect they preach really good
14:25
sermons and they talk about what an amazing Christian they are in these really good
14:30
sermons they'll cry even
14:36
or they have one Vice pornography drinking
14:42
they have something because there's no way you can live pure and holy when you're far from God
14:52
and that is a big reason why we see so much sin in the church and in leaders
14:58
spirits of religion so this is like fake Christianity
15:05
fake Christians fooling themselves and others it says Matthew 23 27 woe to you
15:10
teachers of the law and Pharisees this is Jesus speaking woe to you teachers of the law and Pharisees you Hypocrites you
15:17
were like whitewashed tombs which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of bones of the dead and
15:24
everything unclean in the same way on the outside you appear to people as righteous but but on
15:31
the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness
15:41
so these people they are hiding from themselves they're hiding from God they're hiding from themselves and
15:47
they're hiding from other people they're hiding under hypocrisy they have
15:52
bad motives in their hearts that's another big thing that we see with the spirit of religion
15:58
we start to see that Spirit of religion that the the Pharisees had of
16:04
jealousy when you are close to Jesus's heart you
16:11
don't get jealous of people you're in fact you're too focused on Jesus
16:16
and and when your eyes are locked on Jesus you're in just the world of joy and contentment
16:25
and you just want God's plans for your life and you have this Revelation that if the
16:31
promises haven't come to pass yet then that just means that it's not God's timing yet which means that I'm in God's
16:37
will right now Hallelujah that's the only place I want to be so therefore I don't want Joe shmoe's job
16:45
I I don't want Danielle's position
16:51
I don't want you know these things that are envied this happens a lot in Ministry people
16:57
want people's platforms they're jealous and all that but it does not happen when your heart
17:03
is close to God you're too focused on your own life with
17:10
God but when you're far from God that's
17:16
where the spirit of jealousy breeds that's one of the biggest reasons why it is the Christians that try to kill other
17:23
Christians like like how the Pharisees killed Jesus that's why we see so many Christians are
17:30
the most harmful to other Christians uh in terms of trying to tear down their Ministries slander and speak against
17:37
them this is why Spirit of religion they're far from God that is the secret sins
17:44
they're hiding is jealousy
17:49
so because they're so far from God anything's possible with the evil that
17:55
can happen but it becomes shocking when people don't know about this fear of religion because they're like but they
18:02
wouldn't I I heard them preach and they're crying and they're so about God how could they do such a thing
18:08
I don't believe it this is why
18:13
it's their their who Jesus is talking about the whitewashed walls they look so
18:19
good on the outside if you don't have spiritual eyes if you don't have this equipping this spiritual food I'm giving
18:24
you now you will see the white washing and be amazed you'll be fooled by them
18:30
they've done their job they've fooled you
18:36
Hallelujah this is when you have this this uh equipping and your eyes opened up today
18:42
now you'll be able to discern real fruits real fruits are not the white washed
18:48
what does the scripture say whitewashed tombs which look beautiful on the outside
18:54
real fruits are not the beauty on the outside
18:59
or not the smile the charismatic smile and everything and the tears
19:05
no it's what's on the inside and if you have spiritual eyes you can see what's on the inside you won't be fooled by the
19:11
outside amen [Applause]
19:25
Matthew 7 21 not everyone who calls me Lord Lord will enter the Kingdom of
19:31
Heaven only those who actually do the will of my father and heaven will enter on Judgment Day many will say to me Lord
19:38
Lord we prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and perform many miracles in your name but I will reply I
19:45
never knew you get away from me you who break God's laws
19:53
I know probably a lot of you might have had a hard time understanding the scripture but you'll be able to understand it from what I just shared
19:59
with you right now there are people whose hearts are far
20:06
from God and God never knew them they begin to fool themselves
20:12
deep down they should feel conviction that their hearts are far from God that they carry jealousy and selfish ambition
20:18
in their hearts but many times they push away that conviction probably like how the
20:25
Pharisees did and instead they start to fool themselves
20:32
they start to just push down the truth
20:38
and think they're serving God but their hearts are far and God never
20:45
really knew them and when when someone has this selfish
20:52
ambition to be some big servant of God that's a big open door for the devil
20:58
and when you start going down that path devil starts to come in you devil can give you demonic Powers
21:05
psychic powers that appear prophetic
21:11
to those who don't have spiritual eyes to see so
21:17
in this scripture it says didn't I prophesy no you
21:24
had psychic powers and you spoke as a psychic in the name of Jesus
21:32
you wowed people with what you could see but it really wasn't from the spirit of
21:38
God didn't I cast out demons in your name
21:44
as Jesus says demons actually cannot be cast out without the anointing demons can't cast
21:51
out demons Jesus says this when he's accused of this by the Pharisees
21:57
but same thing if you can access demonic Powers because you have such selfish
22:03
ambition you're so determined to make yourself a great servant of God uh that's a huge open door for the devil
22:10
devil can give demonic powers of psychic powers well in the same way the devil can make
22:18
demons play around in your presence but not actually leave people
22:25
I I started to see this big scheme of the devil these certain people with a spirit of religion and the spirit of
22:31
jealousy started I've seen this happen I've seen it happen to me but they they
22:36
tear they try to tear down true anointed Servants of God and one of their schemes is to call
22:44
people forward and and try to cast demons out of them with the intention of getting demons to
22:52
say that those demons were put in there by the true anointed servant of God
22:59
and demons come from the father of Lies so demons absolutely lie
23:05
that's why I don't speak to them that much because there's a spiritual principle
23:10
I'm getting a little deep here but there's this spiritual principle that when you walk in your Authority
23:16
accurately that's what makes demons obey but walking in your Authority accurately
23:21
means many things one of that means not giving demons the time of day
23:28
seen them as disgusting and repulsive and they don't deserve any Glory
23:34
at any time of day and so when they're in a person
23:40
our job is to walk in the authority get out of there
23:46
not have a whole conversation when we could be doing the work of God worshiping God doing the things of God
23:52
but having a whole conversation with a demon maybe to look impressive or something there's times we can there's times it's
23:59
appropriate to talk to Demons we see Jesus doing that we see disciples doing that sometimes but we don't see Jesus
24:04
having a long conversation with them and we don't see Jesus talking to Demons all the time
24:09
but so this is there's this principle that if you are unnecessarily giving demons a microphone and engaging with
24:17
them so much they start to see that you are not executing your Authority properly
24:24
executing your Authority properly means I don't want to give you the time of day leave here now shut up you know Jesus
24:30
would say be quiet and go we got the
24:36
alerts on our phones Hillary's here I looked up the meaning of Hillary it
24:42
means cheerful happy so we're rejoicing in the Revival rain
24:47
amen [Applause] and every one of you is completely
24:54
protected as you drive home today you're completely protected Jesus wanted you here today
24:59
amen Hallelujah so
25:05
um so so so so if you're giving demons a time of day and like talking to them when you're when God doesn't want you to
25:10
be talking to them then they start to play around just it's the same Principle as when a
25:17
teacher who is respected walks in the room everyone goes quiet but maybe a substitute teacher who
25:24
wasn't respected maybe they don't really know their Authority or something what are the kids doing they're fooling
25:29
around they know they can get away with it that's a principle of authority
25:35
so it's the authority of Christ that makes demons to go same principle of authority
25:41
same thing so the demons see oh we get to play around
25:46
mess around I've seen it happen many times when I started growing in the anointing before I learned this I I
25:53
started to see them like played around and then God spoke to me my spiritual father uh equipped me you know and I and
25:59
I learned and and they never mess around again when I walked in that wisdom
26:04
Hallelujah so anyways demons they can lie so by the messing around I mean they
26:11
can start to lie if you speak to them led by the Holy Spirit not to engage in a conversation they'll speak the truth
26:18
because you're the anoint you're the authoritative one over them and they have to say the truth
26:23
right just like we see with Jesus that's how it happened but if you are not executing your
26:29
Authority properly and you're allowing them to speak when it's unnecessary they play around which means part of the
26:36
playing around means they lie they love to do that in the church because it confuses the people of God
26:43
and it makes demons seem more powerful too than they really are
26:49
so anyways if someone is is it has this door opened up to the devil like someone
26:55
with a selfish ambition Spirit of religion far from God wants to be a great servant of God and wants to tear
27:01
other Ministries down this is an open door now for them to start doing deliverance and demons to
27:09
start playing around because the devil wants that anointed Ministry Minister taken down
27:16
so the devil's working together with this person walking in the spirit of religion and jealousy
27:22
and that's how it happens so but these people live in a delusion believe it or not they push down that
27:29
conviction so much that they like the Pharisees are like we are so right and so they come and they say Lord we
27:36
prophesied in your name no you were using psychic powers we cast out demons in your name no you are playing around
27:41
with demons they didn't actually go and perform many miracles in your name same thing
27:47
devil can mess around if you're opening up that kind of door devil can be messing around you're
27:54
saying when God didn't call you to do ministry to be a pastor Apostle Prophet
27:59
when God has not called you there you're opening up a massive door to the devil to use you in a demonic way
28:07
this is what it comes down to I will I never knew you get away from me who break God's laws I never knew you
28:14
the meaning of that is I never called you to do these things I never called you to be an apostle I
28:20
never called you to be a prophet I never called you to be a pastor
28:25
and so and and because I never called you the grace wasn't there there was an open door for the devil and now all of
28:32
these seemingly miracles happen but they weren't
28:38
I never knew you get away from me you who break God's laws who are not obedient
28:51
so another part of the spirit of religion another aspect of it is that it
28:57
is so judging it is judging upon other people and the root of that comes from
29:02
that condemnation at yourself for not being perfect
29:08
that condemnation that you get because you are believing in religion and not the grace
29:14
so that then is who you think God is and you start to be judgmental God to others
29:22
Matthew 7 verse 3 why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in
29:28
your own eye how can you say to your brother let me take this Speck out of your eye when all the time there's a plank in your own eye
29:35
you hypocrite first take the plank out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your
29:41
brother's eye so Jesus is speaking to these people with a spirit of religion who are so
29:47
judgmental towards other people and these are people that pick out they're
29:53
constantly seen bad in other people they're not even seeing the good there they have an eye for the bad they
29:59
have an eye to judge they have an eye not just not really for the bad many times people with this judgmental Spirit
30:06
of religion they they're they're seeing something in a Twisted perception
30:12
like someone's not even being sinful someone's not even being bad but they have that they're it's distorted in
30:19
their mind and they're just judging and so the Scripture it says first take
30:24
the plank out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye
30:30
now this shows that when you are judging somebody first of all that's not your job
30:37
your job is to love people it's God's job to be the judge
30:43
you judge fruits to see what Ministry you're called to be planted at you judge
30:48
people's fruits to to discern who you should bring close to your life
30:54
but that's judging not like judging a person like oh you're bad
31:00
you're sinful but it's judging for your own good to know oh I I'm not called to be here oh
31:06
I'm not called to bring this person close that's the only kind of judging you should be doing
31:12
the rest of the time you're called to just love people and see them with loving eyes see them with good eyes
31:18
see the best in people like how God sees his people he doesn't see all the dirt he sees the beauty
31:26
amen but when you're having this judgmental
31:32
eye to find bad in people you're automatically way worse than the person
31:40
you're judging why because you have the plank they only have a speck
31:48
take the plank it doesn't say take the speck out of your eyes so you can take the plank that you truly did see out of
31:53
their eye no it's it's this is powerful scripture it's basically saying if you are so judgmental of people you're the
32:00
one with a problem they don't even have a problem maybe they're not perfect but they're way better than you are
32:09
in terms of purity and holiness they have a speck you have a plank maybe
32:15
they don't even have a speck but you're just having the judgmental eye
32:21
so that so you'll recognize this spirit in people judging judging judging other ministers judging other Christians all
32:28
they do is Judge God did such amazing wonders just like
32:33
the times of the Pharisees people are being healed by Jesus and all they can see is he did on the Sabbath he broke a
32:40
law judging rather than seeing the beauty
32:45
people carry the spirit today
32:55
the next aspect of the spirit of religion is uh being prideful
33:02
Luke chapter 18 verse 9 to some who are confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else Jesus told
33:09
this parable two men went up to the temple to pray when a Pharisee in the other attacks
33:16
collector the Pharisees stood by himself and prayed God I thank you that I am not like other people robbers evil doers
33:23
adulterers or even this tax collector ew I fast twice a week and all I give a
33:31
tenth of all I get so you see how he he's he's judging his
33:38
righteousness based on what he does not that he's close to the heart of God
33:44
and that he's really following God's will and that he's obedient he's judging his
33:50
righteousness based on what he does the religious rituals
33:57
okay but the tax collector stood at a distance oh by the way Tax Collectors were like really sinful at that time
34:02
they were seen to be really sinful by godly people too
34:07
the tax collector stood at a distance he would not even look up to heaven but beat his breasts and said
34:12
God have mercy on me a sinner he was humble he saw the truth of who he
34:20
was that he was really sinful and he needed God's grace and he was coming
34:26
repentant he was coming humbly and he wanted
34:31
to be close to God's heart he wanted God's forgiveness
34:39
verse 14. I tell you that this man the tax collector rather than the other went
34:45
home Justified before God for all those who exalt themselves will
34:50
be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted so this means that this
34:57
um this uh it was a Pharisee
35:03
this Pharisee this Pharisee that was not doing the is the tax collectors kind of
35:10
like think of like worldly people sleep around doing drugs alcohol
35:17
watching bad movies stuff you know that's like that person of today okay that's the the tax collector okay living
35:24
super worldly but he actually is coming in Repentance right now but this is what he was doing yesterday
35:30
even earlier that day live in super worldly super sinful
35:36
but the tax collector are sorry the Pharisee is the one in the church
35:42
the one in the church who yes is tithing perfectly
35:48
fasting as praying is reading the Bible has the Christian smile
35:55
talks so christ-like leads Bible studies
36:02
that's like how it would be today
36:08
and they say ew this sinner ew This gay person
36:15
ew these people sleeping around ew these Democrats
36:29
you know like I thinking like I am so perfect and these sinful people are
36:36
awful but God literally said that sinful
36:41
person now it's not just any sinful person it's a it's a sinful person who repented
36:47
by the way I'm not saying that anything like Democrats or Republicans are right I'm just saying that many times many
36:54
times there are religious Republican Christians who are very self-righteous and who look down upon other people when
37:01
they shouldn't that's what I'm saying amen not saying any political party is right
37:08
or wrong but we you got to be careful this Spirit of religion has seeped in in that area
37:15
you know seeped in thinking I'm so right I'm so perfect and that judgment is is really
37:23
dangerous because God literally says God literally says you're not righteous
37:29
because of how judgmental you're being and because you're actually far from my heart and you're not humble
37:36
but this person who you see as worldly and sinful and they have been sinning
37:41
but they come humbly in Repentance this is who is Justified which means in
37:48
right standing with God amen
37:54
Hallelujah [Applause]
38:06
thank you
38:13
so the next part of the religious spirit is that they are offended by the new
38:18
wine the old wine conflicts with the new wine
38:27
just as the Pharisees conflicted with Jesus so when we say Spirit of religion it
38:34
really means old wineskin just like the Pharisees you can think of them as the same old wine skin Pharisee religious spirit old
38:41
ways and not accepting to the new wine
38:47
this is what happened when Jesus came the Pharisees could not accept the new
38:53
wine that Jesus brought so the sphere of religion today has old
38:59
wine skin and anything that's outside of their
39:06
tradition of how church should be of how what following Jesus looks like
39:13
anything that is outside of that they cannot reject they will call it's
39:18
of the devil these this is the the spirit behind people who say there are
39:24
no more apostles today that's a false prophet or there are no
39:32
prophets today this is the spirit behind
39:37
people who say women cannot preach or be pastors it's a spirit of religion it is
39:43
the same old wine skin the Pharisees had who could not accept God coming in a new
39:50
way as he came through Jesus it's the same thing
39:57
so when you when you see that happening you can know now what it is you don't need to be like well why do
40:03
they say women can't preach and Pastor because they're blinded by the spirit of religion
40:10
why do people say there can't be Apostles because they're blinded by the spirit of religion
40:17
stop trying to understand them and reason with them
40:25
we I mean it's good we know biblically and I have teachings on that on how why
40:31
they're apostles today and why women should preach God is calling them to preach and pastor
40:36
it's good for us to know that but so many people they're trying they're thinking that the spirit of religion
40:43
maybe has some truth or something and they're trying to figure out well what's the truth because these people I look up
40:49
to they really believe so I didn't believe that Apostles aren't around today and
40:55
that woman can't preach and that prophets aren't don't exist today either
41:01
Spirit of religion is blinding them plain and simple this is simply God's way this is simply
41:09
the new wine that God is restoring us his Apostles and Prophets to the body of Christ
41:15
amen that God is using men and women
41:21
to lead to lead churches to be five-fold offices Apostles prophets evangelists
41:27
pastors and teachers this is simply God's way his biblical way that we
41:32
haven't seen in a while this is the new wine so be at peace stop letting the spirit
41:39
of religion get to you with their old wine theology you're trying to figure out you can't figure it out it's just
41:45
wrong Hallelujah
41:51
it makes you tired spiritually just it's the old mine this is why this is why it's important for you to know this
41:57
teaching because you've been bogged down and tired out by the spirit of religion in
42:02
your ear and trying to figure it out and reason with it time to Let It Go
42:09
let go that old wine skin [Music] be free and fly with God in the new wine
42:16
Hallelujah [Applause]
42:27
so by the way um you'll you'll find the spirit of religion people that are offended by the
42:32
new wine they're going to be picking up scripture that they like only and they twist it with wrong revelation
42:41
and they ignore the scripture that contradicts their wrong revelation
42:46
for example they find a scripture that they believe is speaking that women can
42:51
preach but really they're coming with wrong Revelation without the context they're
42:57
twisting it and they're ignoring the many many other scriptures throughout the whole Bible
43:03
from the Old Testament the new to the New Testament of God using woman in leadership
43:08
like as judges like us prophetesses like as an evangelist and a an apostolically
43:16
Mary the first one to proclaim the gospel that Jesus chose it was not an accident
43:21
he's he chose her to reveal to First and he entrusted her with a very big responsibility of being the first one to
43:29
declare that he had Rose from the grave to the disciples to the men
43:35
she said it first they ignore they ignore the the
43:43
teacher who Paul entrusted with to to bring a message to one of the churches
43:49
they ignore all those and they find the scriptures that that that appeases them that they can twist
43:56
and they shove it shove it shove it shove it that's the spirit whenever you see those comments on the Facebook all
44:01
the time second Timothy Timothy scripture about women can't preach you know that's the spirit of religion who's
44:08
behind what behind that keyboard that's what that is
44:13
that's all that is amen
44:21
okay and so I think it is so appropriate that the rain is falling down on us
44:28
today the cheerful joyous rain
44:34
because on this day that this message is going forth because one of the one of
44:40
the other aspects of the spirit of religion is that it blocks the move of the Holy Spirit it shuts up the Heavens
44:48
to keep it from raining down in the church among God's people
44:54
it blocks the move it keeps people dry it keeps the Holy Spirit out of the
45:00
church because Holy Spirit needs to be desired
45:08
Holy Spirit comes as new wine he needs to be desired he's gentle he doesn't force himself and it's very sad when you
45:16
have leaders who have the spirit of religion and you have precious innocent people who aren't religious who just
45:22
want to know God and they literally are kept from encountering the holy spirit because of the religious spirit in the
45:29
leaders of the church completely blocking the Holy Spirit from
45:34
moving and this is why it's so important you find the right church and this is so important why you find where the
45:41
anointing is moving because one of the biggest ways that God moves in power is through vessels and that it says with
45:46
Peter the sick and Demon oppressed came to under his shadow and they were all healed and delivered
45:52
God's main way of touching his people in power of releasing his spirit is through
45:59
vessels in a church through his leaders so this is so important that you don't
46:05
stay in a lukewarm church but you find where the holy spirit is allowed to move and have his way so you can be drenched
46:13
by the reign of the holy spirit all Sunday every Sunday throughout your weeks in Jesus name
46:20
amen that's why it's so dry in these these
46:27
it's the same churches with these these rules and this judgment and this
46:32
righteousness well you have to fast and pray and it comes in this judgment way
46:38
judgmental way that's why you're finding things aren't working in your life because
46:45
you're a sinner you're not praying enough you know preachings like that that come
46:52
very judgmental that aren't coming with the heart of God the love of God becoming as judgment
46:57
that's why those same churches are so dry holy spirit is not there
47:05
that's the spirit of religion
47:11
Matthew 23 verses 33 this is a passion translation you are nothing but Snakes in the Grass
47:18
The Offspring of poisonous vipers this is Jesus speaking to the religious spirit people the Pharisees
47:24
you are nothing but Snakes in the Grass The Offspring of poisonous vipers how will you escape the Judgment of hell if
47:30
you refuse to turn in Repentance for this reason I will send you more prophets and wise men and teachers of
47:38
Truth do you know this is the New Testament this is Jesus saying in the New
47:44
Testament I'm going to send you more Prophets
47:50
some will crucif some you will crucify some you will beat mercilessly with whips in your meeting houses abusing and
47:56
persecuting them from City to City as your penalty you will be held responsible for the righteous blood
48:02
spilled and the murders of every Godly person throughout your history from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of
48:08
Zachariah son of jehoida hoyada whom you killed as he stood in the temple between the Brazen Altar and the holy place I
48:15
tell you the truth the Judgment for all these things will fall upon this generation
48:21
so Jesus is speaking this um to the the religious people
48:28
and you're seeing the Heart of Jesus that he hates the religious spirit
48:34
that he means business he's not playing around it's not okay
48:39
Jesus is saying you're going to go to hell if you don't change you're going to be cursed the blood is
48:46
going to be on your hands of these Prophets of these people of me
48:51
vessel Servants of me that you kill that you persecute that you speak against it's on you the judgment is on you
49:00
this is serious because it they're literally this is why I say it's the most dangerous spirit
49:07
it's what the devil loves the most it's stopping the flow of the holy spirit it's keeping God's precious innocent
49:13
children from really knowing him and being saved
49:19
they can be blindly LED through religion their whole lives it's a big deal to God it's really
49:24
serious business the last aspect of that I'm going to go over today of the spirit of religion is
49:31
that they are nitpickers knit Pickers
49:37
Matthew 23 verse 23 I love it the frickerish is actually in the scripture
49:42
in the passion translation great sorrow awaits you religious Scholars and Pharisees this is Jesus
49:48
speaking again great sorrow awaits the religious Scholars and Pharisees frauds
49:54
and Pretenders remember what I was sharing with you about how they look so perfect on the outside and sound so
50:00
perfect but on the inside their hearts are far from God and they're being judgmental and they're being prideful
50:06
and they're bringing that upon God's people judgment and spirit of religion
50:12
for you are obsessed with peripheral peripheral issues peripheral means like
50:18
uh outliers it means things that aren't are secondary or not primary
50:24
you're obsessed with peripheral issues like insisting on pain meticulous tithes
50:29
on the smallest herbs that grow in your Gardens these matters are fine
50:35
yet you ignore the most important duty of all to walk in the love of God
50:43
to display Mercy to others instead of judgment and being Hypocrites
50:49
and being prideful but mercy and love displaying that to others and to live
50:55
with integrity to live without those selfish Ambitions and selfish motives and jealousy in your
51:02
heart but to live with an integrity readjust your values and place first
51:08
things first what blind guides nitpickers
51:15
you will spoon out a gnat from your drink yet at the same time you've gulped
51:21
down a camel without realizing it
51:27
meaning like the not I'm making sure that every I'm a
51:33
perfect Christian I appear the perfect Christian I do all the rituals pray fast read the
51:41
Bible every day I leave the Bible study serve
51:46
I don't do I don't drink I don't drink even a sip of alcohol
51:51
I never sleep around I'm perfect taking the gnat out I won't even have a
51:58
sip of alcohol napped out but you've you've gulped down a camel
52:09
meaning you're so far from God you're not only
52:14
sending yourself to hell you're sending others because of the wrong Jesus you're preaching
52:21
and portraying you're putting the spirit religion into others that's why the spirit of religion
52:26
is so rampant in the body of Christ because they've they're just learning what they've been taught this is a big deal
52:33
this is serious so I mean he keeps saying like you guys are not even righteous you guys are
52:38
doing all the right Christian things you're not drinking you're not doing drugs you're not sleeping around you're reading the Bible you're praying but you
52:43
won't go to heaven I never knew you swallowed a camel
52:51
so okay until nitpickers so religious people people with a spirit
52:56
of religion are nitpickers they make up rules about everything that
53:03
aren't actually rules God has done away with like the rigid
53:09
law and rigid rules and now he has his word but his word must be followed by a
53:16
must be followed by the revelation of the Holy Spirit so now following God is not about like
53:23
these meticulous rules these exact rules but it will look kind of different in
53:29
all of your lives like the amount they're like I can't tell you how much of the Bible you're
53:34
supposed to read every day because there's not a rule
53:43
and and it's different for all of you the holy spirit is speaking to you differently to every person here how
53:48
much the Bible he wants you to read a day and it will change throughout the season so that's how it applies for everything
53:59
it's by the following of the holy spirit because you're close to God and you want to please him and he's like the wind he
54:04
changes he does a new thing he's not into rigid nitpicky rules
54:10
so Spirit of religion they make up rules about everything they make up rules about modesty they say you can't wear
54:15
makeup you have to have your hair covered the clothes you wear have to be a
54:21
certain way I tell you what it is I'm
54:27
seeing the spirit of religion come at me every single day through social media I see the craziest
54:33
things I wish I wrote them down Chantal we talk about this I mean some of them are outlandish
54:41
like outlandish like what people actually think this people actually get get these weird religious rules they
54:48
make up out of thin air like this what in the world like one of them I think was like
54:55
you're so bad you're you never say Jesus Christ you just say Jesus
55:03
I I picked this that I'm like I never knew I
55:08
could be judged I know people have different opinions I know that Spirit of religion is really out there but I didn't know I'd be judged being judged
55:15
on the craziest things this was a recent one um I was wearing a shirt
55:21
the sleeves went to here they actually covered my shoulder like to hear
55:27
it was in church a few weeks ago and I got a comment saying
55:32
this is so disappointing you should be wearing sleeves
55:37
and they didn't say the whole arm it just had to be asleep so I think they meant they just needed one inch more and
55:43
then I would be righteous then I would be modest
55:49
I mean I wasn't even a tank top it was to hear like a cap sleeve is what I was wearing
55:57
I get crazy religious meticulous nitpickers oh all day every day
56:04
whoa but they they have everyone has different rules I mean I mean some
56:09
people will think they will they will believe so strongly God told them that women should never wear pants I get that
56:14
one too I get that one too I also some people believe so strongly that that um you
56:21
know maybe the dress or the pant the dress has to go to here if it were to go half inch more
56:28
you're sinful half inch higher you know I
56:34
people make up rules for everything but really with what you wear it should be led by the Holy Spirit
56:40
it should be with the heart of I want to please you God I want to represent you well in terms of the makeup in terms of the hair and this is for men and women
56:47
in terms of the clothes you wear it should be the heart should be I want to represent you well God
56:52
and I don't want to be distracting to men or women with what I wear I don't
57:00
want to wear something really revealing that could be making a man lust after
57:07
having that in your heart just those simple things
57:12
and that's it and then holy spirit will lead you and how that will look for you will probably be different from other people
57:18
it's just it just depends amen so there isn't a spirit I can't
57:23
tell you the certain length the certain how baggy the pant should be
57:30
how long the sleeve should be there's no rule that God has given
57:36
but the spirit of religion adamantly believes there is and will judge you and speak your
57:42
sinning because you need a half inch longer sleeve
57:48
another one is that some people the spirit of religion thinks this is I'm just giving you a lot of examples of
57:53
nitpicky rules only one Bible translation is accurate
57:58
laughs no it's good to have many translations
58:05
because it's translating what was never English and actually we speak
58:10
differently today then we did hundreds of years ago when Bible first started like KGB for example
58:17
we speak very differently today and we cannot understand certain words
58:23
and kg for example so we'll be reading the Bible we'll be confused what
58:28
so it's good to have different translations to help us fully understand the best thing to do is compare different translations especially if
58:35
it's a verse that isn't straightforward that isn't like uh you know
58:40
um and then and then Sarah uh gave birth to a baby you know that's
58:45
straightforward right so if it's not a straightforward one but more complex scripture it's wise to look
58:52
at different translations and have Holy Spirit speak to you through those translations
58:58
amen another one you have to have a Bible
59:03
degree from this school to be a pastor you have to be ordained by this certain
59:09
school to be a pastor it never says that in the Bible in fact the disciples were fishermen tax collectors and they were
59:16
discipled by Jesus spiritually without textbooks without a certain
59:21
degree from an accredited college [Applause]
59:27
and in today's time I haven't seen many Spirit-filled universities so sometimes
59:35
they can do more harm than good because it's a lot of the spirit of religion teaching coming at you
59:41
so for sure I mean even for me I didn't go to Bible School but I had the best teacher I think there
59:48
is in the world my spiritual father taught me so much and I learned so much
59:53
from him Prophet Joe Davey I was equipped so much he's walks in the power of God like I had never seen he's been a
59:59
minister for many many years 40 plus years as a church of thousands and so many have been set free healed touched
1:00:07
by God and his ministry his spiritual sons and daughters are powerful Servants of God Apostles and Prophets evangelist
1:00:14
pastors and teachers in his ministry and I have learned I can tell you a million times
1:00:19
I'm sure of it that I have learned so much more from him God through him than
1:00:27
if I went to a Bible School I probably wouldn't learn how to cast out demons and the complexities of the
1:00:34
spiritual realm and the secrets of the anointing in the Bible School amen
1:00:43
here's another meticulous rule nitpicky rule that Spirit of religion has you'll
1:00:48
probably hear a lot of people say uh you like you can only buy people basically make it seem like you can only
1:00:53
buy clothes from Christian companies and eat food from Christian restaurants
1:01:00
they think the devil's everywhere we live in this world and we are not of this world but we live in this world
1:01:07
and most places when it comes to clothing when it comes to restaurants
1:01:14
it's sanctified when you go there and get it and buy it and eat it you are anointed you are
1:01:21
walking in the anointing you have the covering of this anointing in your life and so
1:01:27
these things aren't like covered with witchcraft and demons gonna hop on you when you get a coffee
1:01:35
because there's a mermaid cup mermaid on it
1:01:42
it's be different if if it'd be different it now now um yoga is something different
1:01:48
yoga it is a known thing they are open about it that the roots of it are from
1:01:54
uh worshiping gods and all the poses are worshiping God s
1:02:01
that's the root of it that's the origin of it it's all about that and it's open you don't have to look hard to find that
1:02:07
truth don't do yoga that's different it is it is open it is
1:02:13
blatant it is we believe in other gods and we want you to too we want you to
1:02:19
worship other gods it's basically what it's saying by wanting you to do the poses right now that's different
1:02:26
but other things just because it has a picture of a mermaid does not mean
1:02:32
that there's curses put upon all the things from there that you wouldn't take amen now there's
1:02:40
a place in L.A that's called Lucifer's Pizza I'm not gonna go there
1:02:46
I drive by it and I'm like it I rebuke that
1:02:52
but there's there's things that does anybody know
1:02:57
that place in L.A there there's things that are blatant like we love the devil we worship us
1:03:05
Gods come join us that's like Lucifer's Pizza to me in my opinion I mean why there's a million
1:03:11
things you can name it so when it's blatantly and you can see they're like inviting you to partake
1:03:17
with them of the devil no that's different that could be an Open Door
1:03:24
but other things I mean most most companies when it's clothing when it's food and restaurants most of them are
1:03:31
not going to be super spiritual people running the company and their employees aren't going to be all Christians
1:03:37
some of them could have big a lot of them have a lot of demons this doesn't mean that demons are being
1:03:43
transferred to your food or to your clothes you are protected by the anointing and
1:03:48
some people think that way they're like oh I'm scared and they they want to be isolated not
1:03:54
work anywhere where there's no Christian where there's uh worldly people not eat anywhere where there's worldly
1:04:00
people not go to stores where there's worldly people where in the worlds we have to be the light in the world sometimes that
1:04:07
means going into a restaurant and being a light to the employees the people you interact with the store
1:04:15
that's part of our ministry about our everyday life ministering to them I remember one time years ago I went into
1:04:21
a coffee store and this woman her eyes were just full with tears and God just led me to minister to her right there
1:04:28
wasn't a Christian coffee shop but God led me there to go minister to her amen
1:04:36
also this is another meticulous rule thinking like every hotel room I have to take oil and put it everywhere or else
1:04:42
demons are going to touch me in my sleep or even your home thinking that you need to put oil all over the home or there's
1:04:47
demons just everywhere once again you have the Holy Spirit In You
1:04:55
yes God can use oil for things but many people are using oil when it doesn't even have anointing on it
1:05:01
and they don't realize that what's in them is more powerful and even more than that the covering
1:05:07
they're under the anointing like the protection of anointing you have here you go to hotel room and the anointing
1:05:13
is released there the covering upon you is released there
1:05:19
and you will see peacefully and it will be clean in there in Jesus name
1:05:25
if you have demons in your house you come here you receive Freedom you
1:05:31
receive freedom from all those things in the house and you go home and the house is clean it's cleared you don't need to
1:05:37
take your olive oil from down the street and put it around there you don't even need me to put my hand on the oil I
1:05:44
could do that but you need to understand the power of the anointing and stop being religious with these made
1:05:51
up rules that religion religious spirit has spoken
1:05:56
men oh here's a good one the nitpicky rules
1:06:04
you can't have a nice car a nice house a nice clothes or a nice purse
1:06:12
that's the spirit of religion nitpicky rule another one money isn't the problem
1:06:18
if it's not your God but the spirit of religion
1:06:25
they think that they think that having anything nice means that money is your god
1:06:31
oh I'm not I've you know what I had a gift
1:06:36
I never okay I have middle class family they're retired teachers
1:06:42
never even knew what design or anything was until I moved to LA I never even heard of the brands except
1:06:48
for in a song like the like hip-hop songs or something I heard it doesn't like High School
1:06:55
I never knew about designer anything my my dad grew up on a dairy farm
1:07:00
my parents are we shopped at Kmart and Ames have you heard of Ames
1:07:07
the nearest mall was an hour and a half away all my clothes grown up for Ames Kmart
1:07:14
that was life so um anyways I never have bought a
1:07:19
designer bag I wouldn't even have had the money to do that anyways but um one of my spiritual daughters this
1:07:26
year blessed me with a designer bag and I I went traveling with it and it
1:07:35
was in a picture and oh my goodness the spirit of religion came out to play
1:07:41
or should I say judge and it was crazy it was like the comments were just saying all of a
1:07:47
sudden like oh I can't follow you anymore other people were saying accusing me of
1:07:54
buying it myself which there's no problem with that we're called to live an abundant life to not be
1:07:59
um wasteful and you know greedy but it's okay to okay to buy yourself a
1:08:06
nice car a nice house a nice bag when it's Holy Spirit Led in God's timing in
1:08:11
God's season that could be 10 years from now you gotta be patient God could be calling you to not spend anything on
1:08:17
yourself for a season but there can be a season it's okay to do that
1:08:22
it's okay be free
1:08:27
but other people said oh she's spending all money of the church on this it was a
1:08:33
gift but you see how bad and judgmental they're they're finding the spec which
1:08:40
wasn't even a speck when it was so bad what they're doing they're accusing me of something bad and
1:08:47
they're speaking it publicly could lead many people astray they could believe it
1:08:53
the dangerous this judgmental Spirit of religion is amen
1:09:00
Hallelujah um and then another one is an Olympic
1:09:06
rule you cannot do anything outside of tradition outside of the old wineskin rules
1:09:12
tradition tradition of how you do Church of all the aspects of doing church and
1:09:17
being a Believer whatever their tradition is the time you fast how you should pray how you should read the
1:09:23
Bible here's a here's one the spirit of religion has rules that you cannot honor
1:09:29
a person too much you cannot honor a servant of God too much
1:09:34
did you hear that there's no such thing as too much honor
1:09:41
the Bible says give honor what honors do if there's a lot of Honor do you better give a lot of Honor not just what makes
1:09:48
a spirit of religion comfortable did you hear me
1:09:54
when there's a lot of Honor due you better give a lot of Honor do not what
1:09:59
makes this Spirit of religion comfortable only
1:10:05
and I had the spirit of religion come out to play and judge and attack me when I honored my spiritual father at his
1:10:12
church in their culture there honor one of the ways they honor is by
1:10:18
getting on their knees and that's honor it's not worship if you get on your knees and worship to
1:10:25
God that's worship to God but if when you get on your knees in honor to a person it's honor and it's
1:10:31
seen as honor it's not seen as worship it's how they honor different cultures have different like
1:10:37
than I think I believe and I'm sorry if I'm messing anything up but I know in like Asian cultures like this means honor but it doesn't mean like I'm
1:10:44
worshiping you right now but in America it could it could look like prayer hands or something like are
1:10:50
you you know but that is their true culture of Honor that's how they give honor and so in
1:10:58
Africa and Tanzania is Africa where my spiritual father is their culture is to get on your knees and to show a seed so
1:11:06
a seed of Thanksgiving on the altar to God and with that knowledge of God has
1:11:11
used this vessel in my life and I honor you I lay a seed at your ministry at
1:11:17
this altar here sowing a seed and that's how you honor
1:11:23
that's a way of big honor so I honored in that way and I and there was so much Spirit of religion attack
1:11:29
That Came Upon me for that they for them it was too much honor
1:11:35
for them it was seen as as worship I guess that was twisted in their eyes
1:11:40
so what that is doing is just one of those meticulous nitpicky rules of something going outside of their
1:11:47
tradition they would have been happy only if I said thank you for how you've touched my
1:11:53
life of how for how God has used you that's what they would be comfortable
1:11:59
with you know Hallelujah Hallelujah
1:12:07
and there's a lot more other rules that I wanted to lay out some of some of them for you to hear today so you can now
1:12:16
understand I bet a lot of you your eyes have opened up amen a lot of you have been like oh
1:12:22
that's what that was that's why that bothered me that's why I knew that was wrong but I didn't know why
1:12:29
the spirit of religion
1:12:34
nitpickers as Jesus calls them so be free
1:12:40
you don't have to live according to these people's lives don't let them make you feel bad don't let them speak these
1:12:46
mean things and judge you reject that Spirit of religion and just
1:12:52
be at peace enjoy the Abundant Life that God's given you enjoy the life of freedom and Grace that
1:12:57
God's giving you amen um
1:13:12
so we really need to see the spirit of
1:13:17
religion is so dangerous this is what God wanted you to see today how dangerous it is
1:13:24
really the importance of shutting the old wine skin it hasn't been seen as so dangerous
1:13:30
because it's been allowed so easily in the body of Christ for so long you know so it hasn't been seen as this
1:13:37
you know you know all these scriptures I've read you see Jesus speaking so sharply you see the seriousness seriousness of
1:13:44
this you see the danger of this so get that religion out of you if there's any traces of this religion
1:13:51
in you of the of the works-based thinking of the Judgment towards other people the tendency to be judgmental of
1:13:59
the hypocritical being hypocrite of the uh being prideful of having these
1:14:05
nitpicky rules if there's any of that in you today's the day to let it go get rid of
1:14:12
it shed it shed the old wine skin be free
1:14:18
and run to Jesus's heart be after his heart
1:14:24
and see people as he sees them and be a vessel who is a vessel of Grace and love
1:14:30
and not judgment this Spirit of religion is so dangerous it's dangerous for your own personal
1:14:36
salvation it's it's the narrow way that leads to
1:14:42
Salvation this is what the narrow way is talking about
1:14:48
this Spirit of religion can't be there in the narrow road
1:14:54
it's dangerous for your salvation it's dangerous for your spiritual health
1:14:59
for your spiritual growth to hang on any part of this religion
1:15:05
from today you might start seeing it God's going to be revealing it to you from this day he's going to start to show you oh like
1:15:12
conviction oh this is what Apostle Catherine was talking about here's some judgment
1:15:17
you know here's some religiousness and this is going to be God shedding you
1:15:22
layer by layer by layer walk with him allow him to convict you allow him to correct you allow him to peel it off
1:15:30
like dead skin amen
1:15:36
Hallelujah so take this seriously getting rid of the religion from today in your life and
1:15:42
and have that this is continuation of shedding the old wines again this is teaching you how to show the old wine
1:15:47
skin it's a process it's going to be day by day because it's a lot of bad learning you have to unlearn
1:15:53
for some of you it's been like your whole life you've only had the spirit of religion in churches teaching you that's
1:15:59
all you've had so this isn't going to be overnight this is going to be a walk with God but he's going to open your eyes he's
1:16:06
going to reveal to you more and more be childlike be humble have the fear of God
1:16:12
see the seriousness of having the spirit of religion and and and have the reality
1:16:17
wow this Spirit of religion has been prevalent in my life I'm humbling myself more every day for any area I could have
1:16:24
religion still in me amen and from today don't let religion get
1:16:30
you down don't entertain religion religious people people the spirits of
1:16:35
religion are not called to be your close friends they're going to be like poison
1:16:41
put those boundaries up put those boundaries up
1:16:47
and and and be be cautious amen be cautious
1:16:53
and and and pray for them and love them from a distance
1:16:58
and and when they if they do change if they do transform then follow the holy spirit with how
1:17:04
you'll minister to them but still be cautious amen we will see in this revival when we see the really though
1:17:12
there's some religious hearts that won't turn that their hearts will be hardened more and they will be turning into the
1:17:18
Pharisees that try to kill Ministries where Jesus is the anointing but we will see some with a religious
1:17:25
spirit like Saul who became Paul Saul was Hallelujah
1:17:32
so Saul had that Spirit of religion he saw all of these Disciples of Jesus as
1:17:37
wrong he had nitpickiness in him he was a nitpicker he had judgment in him and he had bride in him that he was so
1:17:44
righteous and he was doing God a favor to get rid of these false prophets and people following the false prophet and
1:17:49
preaching a false gospel but God had Grace upon him and he
1:17:56
he uh corrected him sharply blinded him and then he was convicted his eyes
1:18:03
opened up in the spiritual realm and God redeemed him to be one of the most powerful Apostles that we read about
1:18:10
today who's written most in New Testament so there is hope for the religious there is hope for your
1:18:16
religious friends and family and and with so much of the the freedom
1:18:22
that's going to be taking place in this revival is actually freedom from the spirit of religion this is the big work we have ahead of us
1:18:28
to free people from the spirit of religion so they can be powerful vessels of God like Apostle Paul amen hallelujah
1:18:38
Hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus Hallelujah
1:18:46
if you can just close your eyes right now and take a moment with Jesus and I know some of you have been convicted
1:18:52
there's some things you realize man I think there's a little I was a I'm pretty judgmental in this area
1:18:58
and I've just been convicted of this that this is kind of me having that uh
1:19:05
that huge thing in my eye that plank so Lord I don't want that anymore I don't
1:19:10
want to be judgmental towards anybody even towards people I see as really sinful and evil I don't even want to have that heart of judgment and that
1:19:16
heart of like what I thought was righteous judgment but it was really being like like Saul I don't want that
1:19:21
God just talk to God for a moment talk from your talk to God from your heart right now repent
1:19:29
of any of these areas he's convicted you in
1:19:37
and ask him to remove all the religion ask him to open your eyes
1:19:42
ask him to purify you completely to take all of the old wine skin away completely off of you
1:19:48
tell him
1:19:59
thank you Jesus
1:20:08
thank you Jesus
1:20:14
I declare right now every Spirit of religion must go from every person in Jesus name
1:20:22
all of this wrong Doctrine that's calm of Judgment of being hypocrite of pride
1:20:27
of these rules nitpicky may all come out to now in Jesus name
1:20:33
and may your spiritual eyes open up now may your spiritual eyes open up now to
1:20:39
see religiousness in your life
1:20:45
I release this anointing upon you now may you become more like Jesus may you
1:20:51
become more like his heart may you live in Freedom from today not bound by all these rules
1:20:56
and fear and judgment may you live free and in peace and led by the holy spirit
1:21:04
with whatever you do with what you wear with where you go to eat with with what
1:21:10
you drive with everything you do may it be led by the holy spirit with how you read the word with your time spent with
1:21:17
him in prayer may it be led completely by him in Jesus name
1:21:23
amen amen Hallelujah
1:21:29
Hallelujah praise God praise God
1:21:36
thank you Jesus thank you Lord I know today has been a life-changing day for you
1:21:42
amen your eyes have opened up and you will move forth now never backwards amen
