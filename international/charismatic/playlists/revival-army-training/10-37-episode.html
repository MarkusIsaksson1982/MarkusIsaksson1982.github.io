this week's teaching today is probably one of the most important teachings it
0:06
carries secrets to receive the anointing
0:13
there are secrets and Mysteries to receive the anointing but the thing is is that it's not something so like
0:21
hard to find it's not like God is like hiding it like I don't want you to find it like making
0:28
it difficult the secrets of of accessing the anointing to walk in God's power it's nothing like that but it's the fact
0:35
that you need to have spiritual eyes to see you need to be sensitive
0:42
to when the secrets are released so what I'm going to teach today to some people
0:47
maybe it just sounds like another teaching Maybe it doesn't sound that like
0:53
whoa you know maybe it sounds basic or something but I'm telling you
1:00
you need to you need to Value this you need to take it seriously this is literally like Secrets handed to you
1:07
what I'm going to be teaching today is how to be humble how to be humble
1:15
in the word of God there's the word of God just carries so
1:22
much powerful revelation for us to know the kingdom to understand the kingdom to receive the kingdom to
1:29
inherit the Kingdom to access the Mysteries and the secrets of the Kingdom
1:34
and there's one piece of gold like treasure hidden treasure
1:41
scripture that teaches us how to access the anointing and that is Luke 10 21 Luke 10
1:49
21 so the disciples when they first came back
1:55
from casting out demons they were amazed and they were telling Jesus wow the
2:00
demons obeyed us just like you and Jesus he says
2:07
Jesus was filled with the joy of the Holy Spirit and he said oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth thank you for hiding
2:14
these things from those who think themselves wise and clever and for revealing them to the child like yes
2:20
Father it pleased you to do it this way
2:26
so powerful this reveals it right here the secrets the Mysteries
2:32
of how to access the anointing the passion translation says Jesus says to
2:39
the father you've hidden the revelation of your Authority
2:45
so God has hidden the revelation of how to access the
2:51
anointing how to walk in authority over demons like how to properly execute that
2:58
author Authority effectively where demons will obey and how to access that powerful anointing in
3:05
your life because it's the anointing that makes the demons go that's everything so many people they think of it like
3:12
okay how do you cast out demons um how do you do that and they they do all
3:18
these they think it's like a Works thing like tell me the formula of how much you
3:23
fast of how much you pray um what's your Technique with casting
3:28
the demons out like what are the words that you say and did they think it's like a Works thing they
3:34
think they think it's like something they can figure out like a formula like like you can
3:40
learn you know kind of in the world's way physically kind of thing like go to
3:45
like physical school or something but it's the anointing that destroys the
3:50
Yoke it is the the anointing is everything it's it's like once you have the anointing
3:57
it's the anointing in you doing everything you don't have to do much you don't have to like fight demons
4:04
you're just a vessel of Jesus in power and it's Jesus who does everything
4:11
you walk in your Authority but you just do it very simply
4:18
and you don't have to do much you you you walk in your Authority and then you
4:23
allow God to move through so it's you walk in the authority yes but it's God
4:28
doing everything through you doing the supernatural stuff doing the casting out of demons
4:35
so it the anointing is everything it it should not we should not have our
4:40
mindset of how do I cast out demons how do I get demons to obey
4:47
but rather how can I access the anointing simple like simply that that should be
4:54
it so Jesus reveals it right here
5:01
the ones who access the anointing are the childlike ones The Humble ones the
5:07
ones who are wise and clever who are prideful and who are know-it-alls and who are not humble
5:14
Jesus says right here that the father literally hides these things so in other words
5:22
um God does not put the anointing and God doesn't want to give them the
5:29
anointing when they're that way it's hidden
5:34
these Mysteries so that's why I say that this message is
5:41
so important how to be humble how to be humble and
5:48
um I I feel like it's not taught on much it's kind of said like yes be humble be
5:54
humble but it's not actually taught it's not actually taught like what is
5:59
humility look like and how do I be humble and how do I know I'm humble how do I know I'm prideful and this is
6:06
really important because this is like everything so um see
6:13
humility in the world's way is not glamorous is not
6:20
it's not something to be sought after and humility in the church today
6:27
unfortunately it hasn't like in the body of Christ state today by and large it hasn't been
6:35
put as priority I don't remember hearing even like my
6:41
whole life growing up in church I don't even remember hearing hardly any messages about humility
6:47
much preaching about humility and instead things are very much focused on
6:53
like don't sin and and then and and and people themselves
7:00
are like focusing on how they can look you know as a Christian they're focusing on like
7:07
okay I'm doing all the right things I'm not you know doing drugs sleeping around I'm reading my Bible every day I'm going
7:14
to church every day I'm serving in the church I'm going to Bible study and so on the outside
7:22
they look like they have it all together to their Christian friends to their
7:28
peers to their leaders maybe they're trying to impress or something they're looking perfect right
7:35
um the way they speak they speak so spiritual
7:40
but there's something that that's been really neglected and it's the heart
7:46
that's the place where this humility lies is a heart
7:55
acts 13 22 after removing Saul he made David their King God testified
8:01
concerning him I have found David's son of Jesse a man after my own heart he will do
8:09
everything I want him to do so here we have an example of an anointed servant of God
8:17
when you look in the word of God and you're thinking okay
8:22
what were the anointed ones like what made God choose them what made God
8:29
choose David it actually says it in the word it says
8:35
God says I found David a man after my own heart
8:43
he will do everything I want him to do and then there's another scripture where
8:49
when God is choosing David he says you all look at the outward appearance
8:55
but I look at the heart that's when David was disqualified by his own father
9:03
and his brothers no one thought that he would be the chosen King but God saw the
9:09
heart that shows us that that is how God chooses who to anoint who to pour out
9:14
his anointing in is one thing it's it's the heart
9:20
it's the heart you know so I think as
9:26
Christians today and like in the body of Christ today as I was sharing like there's so much emphasis on the outward
9:33
and it's like people sometimes don't want to surrender their heart they don't want to surrender every part and so
9:39
they're just trying they're trying to just look good to everyone else and living in denial that God
9:47
sees everything that God sees the heart you can hide your heart from other people but you can't hide what's in your
9:55
heart from God he sees it all
10:01
and this is the most important thing the the status of our heart
10:09
I mean this it's God's will for you to walk in the anointing info this is
10:15
fulfilling your purpose so if you don't want your life to be a waste but if you want your life to be purposeful and do
10:21
what God actually created you to do you need to give the most attention to your heart
10:29
instead of ignoring it neglecting and living in denial because no one else can see your heart in the world the thing
10:35
that matters most in the entire world is to please God is to touch his heart
10:40
to be a man or woman after his heart that's everything that's the most
10:47
important the most important job you have the most important thing you can do in this world
10:52
is to every day be after his heart touch his heart please him
10:58
and you cannot neglect your heart in that area the heart is the most important part of being able to touch
11:04
his heart okay so first of all um
11:10
foreign first of all I want to share
11:16
as I was meditating on humility I realized that it cannot be
11:22
like how to be humble and everything like this message I realize it cannot be condensed into
11:28
an hour message so I'm going to be sharing some of the
11:33
big ways of of how to be humble and how to be able to like tell if you're humble or
11:40
not or if you have a lot of work to do if there is pride there so the first the first area right now
11:47
I'm gonna share of how to be humble is that you must have the fear of God you must
11:54
live in the fear of God the fear of God does not mean being afraid of God but it means having deep reverence and respect
12:02
for God so it's to live every day in the Revelation that God
12:11
he is your master you are his servant he is your lord
12:17
he is King you must be submitted to him this is what matters more than anything
12:24
anything is for you to obey him to serve him to be in his will to never take a step
12:31
out this is what's most important and it needs to be in your heart deep
12:38
that this is the most important thing to you that it's so important that it would
12:45
just absolutely grieve you if you were to disappoint God I mean if
12:51
you were to disobey him and step out of
12:59
step out of God's will it would grieve you it would be like the the saddest
13:04
thing that's really how we should be that's the fear of God
13:11
is this intense passion I I want to please God I want I want to touch his
13:16
heart every day I never want to step out of his will and when you live that way there's a lot
13:24
of people that ask like how can I know I'm in God's Will and they're like afraid
13:30
am I missing something am I missing my purpose am I am I in God's will or not
13:36
and I'm telling you you you don't need to be afraid of that if you have the
13:41
fear of God if you really have the fear of God and this isn't about a feeling this is about
13:47
making the intention to have the fear of God um if you have the fear of God you will
13:54
be in his will because God is it wants you to be in his will
14:01
more than you do and if that is your intention if that is
14:07
your heart then God is so good why would he allow you to step out of his will when
14:14
that's your heart people step out of his will when people don't fear God but if you fear God you can rest knowing
14:21
you are in his will the Bible says that God directs the steps of the righteous man or woman so in other words the
14:28
righteous man or woman who has the fear of God God directs your steps he will
14:35
every day he will close doors that need to be closed and he will open doors that he wants to open he will
14:42
move mountains he will shift things he will do Supernatural things to make sure
14:47
you're in his will you can rest but you you need to have
14:52
the fear of God and there's a lot of Christians that are not in God's will there's a lot of Christians that are literally just
14:59
walking out of God's will every single day because of one reason they don't
15:04
have the fear of God they don't care enough
15:12
but it's like when you have that fear of God it's like it's like locking you in
15:17
to God's will safe place
15:24
so that's the first thing you need to live in this fear of God that it would seriously grieve you to be a step out of
15:31
his will and if you can just do that the Bible
15:36
says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom if you can just do that this is where wisdom Comes This is
15:42
where you're really gonna be able to hear God's voice and have discernment and be able to discern when
15:49
the angel of Light is coming in a sneaky way um
15:55
the Bibles those of you that don't know the what that is the angel of Light the Bible says that Satan masquerades
16:01
himself as an angel of Light meaning Satan can come in a sneaky way that sounds spiritual that sounds like God
16:09
um but it isn't God because there's so many Godly things we could be doing right now right but
16:15
there's only one thing that God wants us to do right like right now I could be reading the
16:21
Bible but God is calling me to go Minister and then people aren't going to be free because I'm reading my I'm like
16:26
no I'm reading my reading the Bible is important but like right now this is the only thing that's in God's will you see
16:35
so um when you have the fear of God you're able to have wisdom in here God's voice
16:43
Hallelujah number two you need to evaluate your heart
16:51
Psalm 129 verse 23.
16:57
search me God and know my heart test me and know my anxious thoughts see if
17:03
there is any offensive way in me and Lead Me in the way Everlasting
17:11
so this scripture search me God I want to read this again because this is powerful search me God and know my heart
17:17
so search me God know my heart so you know to have the fear of God is
17:24
like Lord I want every part of me to be pleasing to you I want every part of my heart to
17:30
be pleasing to you um I come naked before you I'm not
17:35
um ashamed of anything because I'm not trying to live a double life you know I'm not trying
17:42
I'm not trying to hide a certain part of my life and hope you don't see it or something which is just silly and is
17:48
living in denial um but no like I know that I have work
17:54
to be done I and that's nothing nothing to be ashamed about because we don't look like Jesus exactly on day one of
18:01
being a Christian that it does not work it will never work like that we have to be transformed by
18:08
the renewing of our mind as we continually look at Jesus and allow him to
18:13
mold us like clay in his hands it's a process so there's nothing to be
18:19
ashamed about dirt in your heart there's nothing to be ashamed about serious work
18:25
that needs to be done um you need to let go of
18:32
shame all of that the lies of the devil and be naked before God and let him see
18:39
every part of you let him examine your heart let him Search Your Heart let him
18:44
test your heart test me and know my anxious thoughts test me and know the
18:49
impure thoughts I'm having the the impure desires I'm having that aren't of
18:55
you test those know them look at them find them and help me Lord
19:01
see if there's any offensive way in me and Lead Me in the way Everlasting so this is such a powerful verse because
19:07
this is saying Lord I want to look just like you I want to think just like you I
19:14
want to see people like you see them but I need your help and I need you to come
19:19
and put your hands your Potter's hands on my heart and and help me I can't do
19:26
this on my own I need you so Lord look at all these offensive ways in pure ways look at these and do something help me
19:35
remove them mold me change me
19:44
and that's when God is able to that's when you're able to be transformed that's the only way is when you become
19:50
naked before God and you say I don't want to live this double life I don't want to live my life with these with
19:55
these selfish motives I don't I just want your will God I just want to be
20:00
exactly like you I just want to please you with my thoughts let the words of my
20:06
mouth the meditation of my heart be pleasing to you Lord that's in the Psalms that should be our prayer that
20:13
should be our prayer amen and there's just a lot of that that doesn't happen today in the body of
20:20
Christ there's a lot of that where people are wanting to hold on to their selfish Ambitions and live a double life
20:26
and look Christian and feel like you're fooling God but you cannot fool God
20:32
and it's time we understand that it's time we really get real about this you can't fool God stop it it's just hurting
20:39
yourself amen so allow God to evaluate your heart and
20:46
part of the evaluating your heart of Allowing God to evaluate your heart is you evaluating like you need like that's
20:53
how you're able to be transformed is when you're part of the process with God
20:59
it's not like okay God I pray for you to just give me a new heart and I woke up
21:04
and I had a different heart we have to do the work with God like we
21:10
have to look with God we have to let God show us you see this part is offensive
21:15
to me my daughter my son this part is impure and so we're gonna take this out
21:20
will you give this to me so you have to go with God and allow him and like hear his voice saying like this is pride here
21:27
my daughter so will you give this up I'll take it right now if you will give it up if you'll surrender it to me this
21:33
right here my daughter my son you're being judgmental but I'm not calling you to judge this person
21:39
you're looking at at the the speck in their eye and that's making you to have a log in your eye because you're being
21:46
critical and of this person when that's not your job your job is to love them
21:52
you know like this scripture about search me God know my heart and Lead Me in the way
21:59
Everlasting so you're what God's leading you he living this life every day like
22:04
Lord let's do inventory in the heart let's look here show me Lord and he shows you these things these as you go
22:11
throughout your day like the thoughts you have the impulses you have the feelings you have towards people the
22:18
things you're feeling the things you want to say the things you are saying that's impure that's judgmental
22:23
that's prideful God will when you pray this prayer when you want this when you want God to Search Your Heart he'll show
22:30
you he'll say he'll convict you and it's this process of you
22:37
surrendering that and when you surrender you change and you it doesn't even take you that long to change if you'll just
22:44
go through this process with God and allow him to take it and change you so
22:50
pride is connected to impurities of the heart so if you have
22:56
impurities in your heart there's usually going to be Pride attached to so
23:04
like this message is is to help you see because some of some of you may not
23:09
realize that you are being prideful in certain areas and so this message is going to help you
23:14
it's going to open up your spiritual eyes to see oh wow I do have pride here
23:20
that's Pride and and and so that's that will humble you and God will take it and it will
23:27
make you be humble so um as you evalu as you yourself evaluate
23:34
you need to evaluate your heart you need to take inventory in your heart you need to be looking with as God's showing you
23:39
you know um looking at these impurities and and and looking at really what's going on
23:45
here so um
23:51
by the way um if you are having certain feelings
23:59
that's impure and I'm gonna go over like specific specific impurities but if you're having
24:07
feelings certain impure feelings that's impure
24:13
not good thoughts that doesn't automatically mean that you
24:19
are impure and sinful in these areas and have pride
24:25
but it's when you act on them that
24:31
you are then prideful you are then sinful in this
24:36
area impure in this area and this is what a lot of people don't understand is
24:42
that your feelings are not you that the devil sends
24:47
um the devil's just like he sends bad dreams out of nowhere when you're not
24:52
even thinking about something impure uh and bad and that this bad dream just
24:59
comes out of nowhere just like the devil just sends that in your mind he'll do the
25:05
same thing with your thoughts and feelings um especially before you're transformed
25:11
when you're more transformed to the image of God the devil really loses his power to be able to just interject
25:19
insert thoughts um and lies
25:26
it's it's part of submit to God resist the devil and he must flee so the more you're doing that he's forcibly he can't
25:33
just like hijack your mind constantly but in the beginning before you have
25:39
progressed in the spiritual Realm by having Victory after Victory by surrendering to God and continually
25:44
walking in authority and rejecting lie after lie before you get to that point or you've
25:51
had just so much Victory and you've doubled can't even try before then there
25:57
are going to be random thoughts and feelings that'll be impure sometimes and
26:04
what that is is the devil's trying to lie to you to try to get you to think that it's your original thoughts and
26:10
that that's really you and so that you'll act on it and so as a
26:16
man thinketh so he is the Bible says but really that means like as a man believes that that thought is his or her original
26:23
thought so he or she is that's what the devil wants
26:28
he wants to try to trick you and lie to you with these thoughts that pop up in your mind from
26:35
him to make you think I'm a bad person because I had this thought I'm so sinful
26:40
I have such a horrible heart that's what the devil wants and like and so as a man thinketh or
26:47
woman thinketh so he or she is so the devil knows the power of that the
26:53
devil knows the power of when you actually believe these thoughts are you like this is my thought then you
27:00
will act on it because of that that's how powerful it is as a man or a woman think thinks so
27:07
he or she is you will act on it you will speak on it so I want to First share with you about
27:13
like when you're taking the evaluation of your heart that um when you
27:20
when you're finding these impure thoughts and feelings you're having um don't don't like get down on yourself
27:29
and think I'm I don't even I'm just awful I'm just constantly having horrible thoughts and
27:34
feelings understand the spiritual realm okay and understand that when you're not
27:40
acting on these things you are not being sinful when you're not speaking the thoughts that you're having but you do
27:46
need to make sure you're rejecting them you you need to make so if you're doing that part you're not acting and speaking
27:53
on the thoughts and feelings you're having and you're rejecting you're not sinning and you're actually having
27:58
victory over the devil Hallelujah and as you keep on doing that the devil will
28:04
not be able to put those thoughts and feelings anymore and you won't have those thoughts and
28:09
feelings and that's you being transformed in more into God where because God I mean he's his thoughts are
28:15
all good you know he's not having the devil send him a thought that he's not God's thoughts are all good good and his
28:22
feelings are good there's no bad in him right so that's how you will be so I
28:28
want you to pay attention now to these certain um impurities of the heart
28:35
these certain uh feelings that you have and some of you might be just having the feelings but have never
28:41
acted on them and some of you are acting on them you're having a feelings and you're acting on them so here we go so
28:47
all these imperators the heart um when you have these you will also
28:53
have pride pride just it comes with it
28:58
jealousy jealousy so um why there is pride attached to
29:04
jealousy is because to have jealousy means that
29:10
you don't think this person deserves what they have and you want what that person
29:17
has and you're like technically that's what jealousy is technically you think
29:22
why does that person have that I should have that I've worked hard I'm great you
29:29
know I deserve this I've sacrificed this this and this
29:34
um why are they having all that success and I am not why did they get all that
29:40
luck in their life blessing in their life favor in their life and I did not
29:46
and then you become bitter and you become like kind of angry at that person and kind of blaming that person so
29:53
that's Pride that's um that's thinking that you are so great
29:58
and you've done so many things that you deserve something um and and this is the thing like we
30:05
need to understand our identity as Servants of God that we don't even deserve to have breath in our lungs but
30:10
it's the goodness of God so every blessing that we have been given every ability we've been given has come
30:18
from God do not get it twisted we should never feel entitled to
30:25
anything anything anything
30:32
we should see ourselves as Servants of God and we should be so focused on God
30:38
getting all the glory and just serving God like seeing our ourselves like Mary said
30:46
Mary we see this call in her life and she said from the Angel and the first words I'm like
30:52
one of the first words out of our mouth was let it be done to me as you have said for I am a servant of the lord we
30:59
must have this identity this is part of having the fear of God I am a servant I am a servant
31:06
we we better not feel entitled we should not feel entitled to have anything
31:12
anything we should not have be entitled to have a spouse and children and a
31:19
house in a car and a career we enjoy and and we shouldn't feel entitled for any
31:26
nice things money we should not feel entitled to have anything I mean this is
31:32
the truth like everything is a gift from God it's God's grace that we are saved today that we
31:38
are not bound by sin and going to hell it's only God's Gift he's given to us
31:44
why would we feel entitled but is this worldly mindset seeped into us that we
31:50
think we deserve things so if you live with this heart of not entitlement but Lord I don't deserve
31:58
anything everything is just a gift that I didn't deserve when you live with in that with that
32:04
heart you won't be jealous you'll see other people be blessed and you'll be like praise God and you'll be
32:09
in you'll be inspired you'll be inspired like wow God could do that with their
32:15
lives wow I'm inspired by what God can do with my life
32:20
you live in a every day being grateful because you're grateful even just to have breath in your lungs you're
32:26
grateful for the small things and you're not annoyed and complaining that you don't have other things
32:33
you won't have jealousy then but this jealousy is rooted in Pride
32:38
of entitlement and it is gross it is it is so impure it
32:45
is it is one of the biggest impurities in the body of Christ today is the pride
32:51
and the jealousy together Christians being jealous of other
32:56
Christians Christians feeling entitled to have what other Christians have like the family
33:03
success Ministry platform anointing
33:10
we need to evaluate our hearts and let God purify us it's gross it's it's gross
33:16
we need to get this out of ourselves and we need to we need to make this a
33:21
priority and not just let it slide anymore we need to be real with ourselves when there's jealousy and so
33:28
if you're having jealous thoughts if you're not acting on it if you're not meditating on it like
33:33
like meditating on how you want bad for a person meditating on like how you're annoyed by this person
33:41
um if you're not doing that if you're not acting on the jealousy like trying
33:46
to bring the person down in some way um if you're not if you're not complaining out loud
33:52
even in your prayers like God I don't understand why they have this and I don't even that saying in a nice voice
33:59
is pride and not good you know is acting on the jealousy so but if you're not
34:06
doing like all of those things if you're not acting on the jealousy by meditating speaking and acting
34:14
and complaining in your prayers if you're not doing those things you are not a jealous person
34:21
but if you are having a lot of jealous thoughts this is a red flag
34:27
because right now we're we're I'm talking about evaluating your heart and so to have humility is the most
34:35
important thing and we need to we need to care about this more like like more than anything like I must be humble I
34:42
must never be prideful I never want to be prideful we should have the fear of God like this
34:47
every day like this should be a priority so um we need to be on the lookout we
34:53
need to be on the lookout for open doors to the devil we need to be in the lookout of of red flags in our heart red
34:58
flags of oh man this could turn into Pride real quick I gotta take care of this I gotta bring
35:04
this to God I gotta be naked before God I gotta allow him to take care of this I gotta allow him to take this out of me I
35:09
gotta repent of these thoughts I'm having I gotta confess with Lord I don't want to be having these thoughts I don't want any jealousy in me
35:16
take it Lord and then begin to thank God thank God for all he's blessed you and
35:22
meditate on on all your blessings so so that entitlement junk gets out
35:29
gets out of you we see this all over the word of God we see this this jealousy in
35:35
the people of God bringing such destruction destruction
35:42
um we see Joseph you know saying I had this dream I had
35:49
this Vision this from God and I saw you bowing down he's just saying this Vision he had
35:56
and his brothers immediately got so jealous like what
36:02
so you're like better than us and Our Father gave you that coat he favors
36:09
you like that's Pride that's Pride
36:15
that's Pride the brothers instead should be like I mean there's a reason that I mean
36:21
Joseph was chosen he had a more like Precious Heart you know more
36:27
pure and godly and Precious Heart than his brothers there was I mean it wasn't like it
36:33
wasn't like um it wasn't like Joseph's father it wasn't like Jacob was being
36:40
like a bad father and like singling Joseph out and making you know
36:45
it wasn't a situation like that by him favoring him and giving him this coat
36:50
beautiful coat it wasn't that wasn't the situation it was just like
36:56
he he was special he was set apart and he had a special heart
37:03
that God had God himself had chosen to advance his kingdom
37:09
to be a leader um and it was just honor
37:15
coming to him in love and and and and even you know
37:21
people who are leaders people who are like chosen you know look at look at David look at Joseph going in the pit in
37:28
the prison they they went through they go through more intense trials so
37:34
like they need more encouragement and love and you know like they they go
37:40
through rougher things so they should be able to have that encouragement and
37:46
love and honor you know so that was that was a situation so the brothers should have
37:52
instead been like been humble and been like oh wow like what an amazing brother we have like he
37:59
has a precious heart that I can learn from and I'm grateful we have him
38:04
his heart that we can learn from um I'm inspired to change by seeing his
38:11
heart you know that's how the brother should have been but instead they were prideful
38:16
and they were like he should not have what he has I should have that because I'm so entitled and then they ended up
38:24
wanting to kill him and that was all jealousy so you see how jealousy and pride are are always together
38:31
um so if you're seeing jealous thoughts in yourself no it's a red flag and bring it
38:36
to God repent and have the fear of God in the area like Lord I don't want any jealous thoughts
38:43
this I mean serious serious business about this I don't want any jealous thoughts Lord I don't want to be jealous
38:49
at all I want to love all your children and honor them and cheer them on and be
38:54
a sister or brother to them be their cheerleader and say way to go and and
39:00
have the Revelation that we're on the same team Lord help me how the Revelation we're on the same team and if
39:05
they win it's a win for me it's a win for all of us because we're one body
39:13
okay the next area of impurity in your heart that you need to be on guard of
39:20
uh that also comes where Pride will be attached to it is
39:27
being quick to judge people being quick to judge people so it is our
39:35
job not to judge people it is our job to have discernment it is our job to look at fruits and discern
39:43
good fruits versus bad fruits so that we can be led by the Holy Spirit of where God
39:51
wants us to be planted in a Ministry and to receive from
39:57
and to receive his true word from and to be covered and to receive the anointing and also to be able to have that
40:04
discernment with who God wants us to bring close in our lives so we're not bringing the wrong people close to us
40:11
so we need to have um the the good kind of judgment that but it's discernment that's all about
40:18
discernment of for my spiritual health for your personal spiritual health
40:24
so that there's no open doors for you that's the only time we're supposed to
40:29
like judge but it's not it's it's it's discernment really
40:34
that's when God talks about like when he's when he does tell us to judge it's meaning that in scripture it's it's
40:41
that kind of judge but people twist the scripture that where Jesus says to judge
40:47
um and they they they use it as an excuse to
40:53
judge with a skeptical and critical and bad heart bad Spirit behind it other
41:00
people and tear them down and speak against them and
41:07
bring harm to them they use it as an excuse we are not called to do this we're not called to tear people down
41:14
we are called to discern and look at the fruits and be led for our own spiritual health but not to tear people down and
41:22
and also we should not be looking at spec the Bible says
41:28
you're looking stop looking at the spec in your brother's eye when you have a log in your own eye it that verse is
41:35
powerful because the revelation of this the the lord gave me was it's interesting that it says
41:40
stop looking at the spec when you have a log in your eye log it's bigger than the than the spec
41:47
that you're seeing the meaning of that is that the to judge people
41:53
to be quick to judge and to be having this heart of like I
41:58
for sure know better and I know all and this person is bad and wrong and coming
42:06
with this like hateful tearing down spirit and heart
42:13
um and know it all uh that is bad like that's really impure in the heart
42:19
it's really impure and so if you're coming in that way you automatically have a log in your eye
42:26
like that's automatically worse than the spec that you're seeing sometimes a
42:31
person doesn't even have a spec but you are prideful and you are being like the Pharisees and I mean they were accusing
42:39
Jesus judging Jesus and they were so sure about it but there was no Speck in
42:44
Jesus's eye right so sometimes there's many times there's no Speck in that eye in the person's eye and sometimes there
42:50
is sometimes you can be right about something but he if though you're right about
42:56
something you're not called to get on your high horse and tear somebody down and come with a bad spirit
43:03
that's not our calling that's on our calling um if there's someone doing wrong God is
43:11
the god is the judge God will if they are in a place of
43:16
leadership if you're in a place of ministry because this is the big area when people do the whole judgment thing
43:24
um God is the one that will take down that person in that Ministry the Bible
43:29
says that the uh that he humbles The Pride the prideful and he lifts The
43:35
Humble he tears down so if there's someone with pride if there's someone in error God himself will take them down
43:42
and he does not call us to be the ones like helping him
43:47
he will do it himself so um if you are noticing like evaluate
43:55
your heart and you're feeling like quick to judge people know that that's not your place your
44:01
place is to to see people with the eyes of compassion with God's eyes of love and you are called to have discernment
44:08
and see like yeah this is off this is this is God this is not like you are
44:14
called to be that way you're called to to judge in that way to discern but for your own spiritual health not to
44:21
play God and tear down somebody and speak bad against somebody that's not that's not
44:28
your calling
44:34
so once you're seeing that quick to judge um in your heart
44:39
know that that's Pride there know that these things it's a big red flag that's you got to take care of these things
44:45
with God you got to bring them to God repent um because it's it it can really lead to to
44:53
destruction Pride goes Before Destruction a haughty spirit before a fall Proverbs 16 18. this is why we need
45:00
to have um such fear of God in this area that we would never have pride uh Proverbs 16 5
45:07
the Lord listen this listen to this one this was this one's a this one should help the fear of God
45:13
come in our hearts if it's not there Proverbs 16 5 the Lord detests
45:19
all the proud of heart be sure of this
45:26
they will not go unpunished whoa
45:34
this is why we need to have the fear of God this is serious the Lord detests all the proud of heart be sure of this they
45:40
will not go unpunished
45:46
pride is such a big issue because this is I mean it's always Pride that is leading people to be vessels of the
45:53
devil and actually do damage to God's Kingdom
45:58
that's what happened with Saul it was Pride pride and jealousy that made him
46:05
try to kill the anointed one of God David Joseph's brothers it was jealousy and
46:13
pride that made them to try to kill Joseph and put him in a pit to die and then sold
46:20
him to slavery it was pride and jealousy in the Pharisees
46:28
that led to that made Jesus to be crucified tortured and crucified was their pride
46:37
and also being so quick to judge so the Pharisees they had Pride they had
46:42
jealousy and they had that quick to judge spirit
46:48
so um pride is the more is like the most
46:54
dangerous thing we can have in our hearts it's the most dangerous thing we can
46:59
have because it it leads to being it leads to being deceived by the angel of
47:06
Light the Devil masquerading Himself as the voice of God
47:13
um I mean that that was the Pharisees like they're they're like so so many of them were determined they
47:19
were right so many of them are determined that Jesus was a false prophet so they needed he should be
47:25
killed they were determined of this so it opened that door for them to be so
47:31
deceived um by the angel of Light to kill Jesus and that's what we see today I've seen
47:38
like for myself and other Servants of God whenever someone's talking against them
47:45
and then unfortunately that many times leads others away from that Ministry
47:52
from where they were receiving deliverance and from where that God had called them to be planted
47:58
to receive the anointing um I've seen all this I've seen all the
48:04
destruction of you know God's Kingdom in that area of people being ledis astray
48:10
because of of people saying this person's false when they're true of people making up
48:16
lies um of people just speaking bad things
48:22
slandering and every time it's Pride
48:29
and jealousy and being quick to judge every time I've seen it happen
48:36
and not just that but like I've seen in my own Ministry and then also other people's Ministries I've seen like
48:43
people leave where God wanted them to stay and be planted
48:49
and live out their purpose and I'd see them leave and I'd see Time After Time
48:55
it was because of Pride it was because of
49:00
um being quick to judge it was because of jealousy and it was because of this
49:06
next impure impure part of the heart that I'm going to share with you right now it
49:11
which is selfishness and being very focused on
49:17
themselves and being successful so this is another big one that
49:27
that Pride goes hand in hand when you are so focused on your own
49:32
success when you're so focused on your own um ambitions
49:37
when you're so focused on how people see you when you're so focused on
49:43
um I I want to try to find my purpose and I think I found it and but being too
49:50
obsessed with like trying to find it and
49:55
succeed there rather than your focus being Lord I want to be in your will in your
50:01
timing and me personally I wanted a I'm not saying me personally but like like
50:06
like you like we're saying to God me I wanted a family by now I wanted this by
50:12
now I wanted to have a house by now I wanted to not be living in this small apartment by now by this age
50:19
I want you know I wanted my parents to see that I could you know have a
50:27
not be living like paycheck to paycheck and have they could have grandkids like
50:32
I had all these desires but Lord it doesn't matter like
50:38
I throw all that away I like all of this my timing and what I want
50:45
and how people see me I threw that all away and I just want to be in your will I just want to serve you God
50:53
this is very important this is a big one when we have we so many people they just
50:59
they want to look good they want to be successful
51:06
and God can have them in this place yet I mean that is God's will for you too
51:11
um walk in the Abundant Life in every area to not be living paycheck to paycheck anymore
51:17
to have a house you know a nice place to live like God wants that for you and
51:24
that's his plan for you and beautiful desires of your heart that you have that he's given you like a family and
51:30
children like he wants it that's coming and um to walk in the anointing he wants
51:37
that for you and that's coming and um all all of these things like it's
51:42
coming but it's many times it's not when you want it
51:48
it's it's later that God has that plan like that first God needed to take you through
51:54
the process he needs to take you through battles to refine you
51:59
and he needs to stretch you and so what happens is a lot of people get impatient in that place of process
52:07
and they're holding on so much to their selfish ambitions that the angel of Light comes in and
52:14
their LED astray there's so many people that start there start Ministries too soon and their
52:22
Ministries die there's so many people that aren't called to do something and they
52:29
start doing it just because they of a selfish ambition they're called to do something else where they will really
52:34
prosper and really be using the anointing so powerfully the
52:39
most powerful not here you know like even like some people may
52:46
be called to be an apostle but they're a pastor like even that some people
52:51
they they even feel in their hearts like I want to I feel I want to preach and and and they
52:59
get zealous but they they forget God in that in what they're feeling in their heart
53:06
they forget about God's timing and they just run with their feelings they run
53:11
they can even have success in certain areas you know
53:17
um success does not equal God's speaking success does not equal God's timing
53:24
um like sometimes it does sometimes a video going viral can be God's breath
53:31
on it and can be evidence and sign of God of it being God but
53:39
every viral video isn't done by God and we got to be careful of these areas of
53:46
success of we got to be careful when people start to um you know encourage us that we don't let
53:54
it go to our heads and that we don't forget God in this area where we're just
54:00
like we run with something we run with something because of success because of what people are saying
54:07
and we forget God we have to be careful we have to be so careful this is a
54:12
sneaky way the Devil Comes there's people with good Hearts there's people who um want to be want to see people set
54:19
free and want to be used in the anointing but they haven't surrendered that the
54:26
selfish ambition part in their heart they haven't fully surrendered that yet and they they're really a little
54:33
impatient to be really walking in exactly their
54:39
purpose you know like the exact where they're supposed to be and so they just run with something too
54:46
fast just because they haven't they run ahead of God just because they
54:52
haven't surrendered that selfish ambition part of their heart their um their desire to be successful and
55:00
look successful and look good they haven't surrendered that and that's an open door for the angel of Light to come
55:08
so um these you know the devil can send success the devil can send something
55:15
that looks like success and it can be a test it can be a test from God
55:22
test of your humility this is really important once you
55:29
um once you are being planted where the anointing is once you are serving where the anointing is once you are being
55:35
close like being close to your spiritual father your spiritual
55:40
mother um you have to amp up
55:46
your fear of God you have to amp up The Humbling yourself you have to amp up
55:52
the evaluation of your heart because the Devil comes in a sneaky way
55:59
because like this impartation is really real God is releasing impartation of
56:04
anointing um to all who come like to all who come to these online
56:12
lives and in person like when I really say I release this anointing it's really
56:18
being released in Partition and there's many testimonies many of
56:24
people who received impartation and demons started trembling right away in
56:30
their presence from young teenagers it happening immediately pretty much
56:37
to pastors like Pastor Heather who will be
56:43
facilitating service leading service when I'm in South Africa
56:48
that Sunday on May 14th and it's going to be powerful by the way it's going to be a testimony sharing and celebrating
56:54
uh the two-year anniversary of Revival breaking out it's going to be so powerful but
56:59
she came humbly she's in her 60s and she's Pastor to church with her husband for years and never saw the power of God
57:06
move and just hungered for people to be free in her church and she came humbly
57:13
um to me just a few weeks after coming this was two years ago about almost two years ago when Revival first broke out she came humbly like to me it's like
57:22
I need what you have I want what you have because I want people to be free in my church like she just came with just
57:28
that simple Pure Heart and her heart was pure so God released
57:33
the anointing God doesn't release the anointing upon people who were impure but it also
57:39
doesn't mean that you're like perfect when he releases the anointing we have to be careful we're not prideful
57:44
like oh because I see the anointing working through me I'm so great like no no no no no no because God doesn't
57:51
release the anointing upon Perfect People he'll release it upon pure hearts but that doesn't mean you're immediately
57:58
transformed into the image of God and also in this revival God is just really
58:03
ready to move and so he's releasing his anointing like fast now upon his people
58:11
um so anyways uh Pastor Heather like three days later she had a service and
58:16
Demon started trembling and people were set free and it was a woman who had gone to the church for so many years and was
58:22
stuck in bondage and then that day she was set free finally and now people are free every Sunday at her church and this
58:28
is just one example there's been so many testimonies so many testimonies that people receiving impartation just coming
58:33
to a Revival service one time um a woman just testified from Australia that she's been receiving online and she
58:41
was interpretation and she's a teacher a school teacher at a Catholic school and now like every day she's leading her
58:48
children through um renouncing and they're getting delivered and coming to Jesus her
58:53
children I mean her students in her class Hallelujah Revival is now so this
59:01
impartation is so real the anointing is becoming not so rare anymore God is
59:07
choosing to release it imparting but um man we have to be so careful
59:13
to not be prideful that once Reese I mean the anointing is so needed and it's
59:18
so shocking it's it's so powerful that once you receive it you can just run
59:24
with it and that's what we have to be careful with to not run with it to not just be
59:30
like oh this means that I'm supposed to start a Ministry now because I have the
59:36
anointing I'm seeing you know no we need to wait on God's timing if
59:42
it's God's calling for you to actually start your own Ministry and if it is his timing
59:47
you have to be very careful or else you could you could be jumping ahead of God
59:53
therefore not walking in his grace and the ministry could just die out and the favor is not there the grace is not
59:59
there you can see demons be cast out but because the anointing is working in you but but what God does is he releases the
1:00:05
anointing and then he tests you with it so he tests to see how you what you'll do
1:00:11
with it um if you'll be humble if you'll be looking to him for everything or if
1:00:16
you'll just run with it as like a successful thing it's like oh great this
1:00:22
will be I'll be successful now or people will be drawn to me now you know we have to be so careful that that stuff isn't
1:00:29
in our heart but the more anointing when you receive anointing and the more anointing you
1:00:34
receive the more humble you should be the more you need to humble yourself the more you
1:00:40
need to humble yourself like me myself I'm like I don't
1:00:46
I just I'm so humbled I'm so humbled and I'm
1:00:52
I'm just I don't feel like deserving or anything I just feel like a
1:00:59
normal person you know that God chose to use and
1:01:08
I'm just so humbled and I don't see it as like something I
1:01:15
I'm worthy of or I deserve yes I obeyed
1:01:20
I obeyed and I sacrificed a lot and I went through a lot
1:01:26
but like all that I went through is like is nothing you know I mean
1:01:32
it all that I've gone through I don't I don't think that when we go through
1:01:38
things we should see that we should have a reward I just think we should we should see
1:01:45
ourselves as Servants of Christ and so if that means being in valleys and going through
1:01:51
um suffering and hardship so that we can be transformed more into his image then that's fine and I see like the
1:01:59
the things I've gone through the pain I've gone through the suffering I've gone through the sacrifice I've gone through
1:02:05
all of that the persecution all the things like I didn't deserve like people making applies about me all
1:02:11
that like I see I see it as beautiful it it it
1:02:17
transformed me into more of God's image that's the reward I don't see that I deserve the anointing
1:02:25
now I deserve more anointing I deserve honor from people
1:02:30
I deserve you know a nice house
1:02:36
I I money I I don't I don't see that I deserve those things
1:02:42
you know like I just feel so humbled I just feel like
1:02:50
Lord I just see that it's all God you know the anointing all that he's done
1:02:55
growth in the ministry I just see that it's all him I know that
1:03:03
he uses vessels I know he used me uses me I know um that my obedience was important but
1:03:11
I don't see it as like I deserve I deserve anything I just think the
1:03:17
reward of being transformed into God's image is everything
1:03:26
and so it's very important to have that heart of
1:03:33
lord I can't believe that you're entrusting this anointing to me I can't believe you've given me these blessings I can't
1:03:40
believe like I can't I can't believe wow like I'm so in awe
1:03:45
Jesus you know but not like yeah I deserve
1:03:51
this or Hallelujah now I have success or you know
1:03:57
so we should be humbling ourselves more and more with the more anointing
1:04:02
with the more blessings that God gives with the um more he lifts us
1:04:08
but the more he entrusts us with the more anointing that he entrusts us with
1:04:13
we should humble ourselves more and we should take it we should have the fear of God more of like
1:04:19
you're interested me with this Lord Lord I just want to do to do this anointing
1:04:25
as you please like to be perfectly in your will never step out this is a big deal what you've entrusted me with Lord
1:04:31
and I just want to be in your world we should have that heart every day amen all right so the last part I'm
1:04:38
going to share um about that you need to be wearing your heart
1:04:44
evaluate your heart in of impurity is feeling that you only need yourself this is one of the biggest reasons why
1:04:51
people don't walk in the anointing because they feel they only need themselves they don't feel like they need other people
1:04:58
First Corinthians 11 1 Apostle Paul was a spiritual father he
1:05:03
says you have many teachers you only have one father I became your spiritual father this is in the word of God that
1:05:08
he was a spiritual father to his son Timothy and to many others and he says First Corinthians 11 1
1:05:14
follow my example as I follow the example of Christ follow my example
1:05:21
as I follow the example of Christ why didn't he just say follow Christ
1:05:28
follow my example it shows that it shows that
1:05:34
one of the really big ways that God transforms us into His Image one of the
1:05:39
really big ways that God leads us and guides us and directs us one of the really big ways God speaks to us is
1:05:45
through other people and not just anyone but through your spiritual father your
1:05:52
spiritual mother through the fivefold ministry Ephesians 4 11 God gave Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers for the equipping of the
1:05:58
Believers so that they would no longer be immature deceived by the devil tossed around by different doctrines of the
1:06:04
devil but that they would be mature vessels of God equipped for works of service so that they could be victorious over the devil and be powerful vessels
1:06:12
of God vessels themselves so we need people we need the faithful
1:06:17
Ministry we need ministers whom God has has chosen to speak through
1:06:25
um you need to have this in your heart God will purposely make it like he will
1:06:30
purposely hide he will hide um his some of his word some of his high
1:06:37
Direction some of his wisdom inservance of God
1:06:42
in their mouths you're praying in your prayer in your room and you want God to speak in an
1:06:49
audible voice you want him you want to open up the word of God and see the answer right there you want to hear his
1:06:54
voice speaking to you how you want but God is chosen to hide it in
1:07:00
your spiritual father your spiritual mother in a possible prop in the the minister the
1:07:07
teacher at your church the pastor of your church
1:07:13
it's one of the big big big big ways that God speaks that God directs you
1:07:20
into wisdom and this is what so many people miss out on they think they can just do it on
1:07:25
their own and the big problem for a lot of people oh they they're
1:07:32
grateful for their spiritual mother spiritual father they're grateful for their Pastor they're grateful for
1:07:37
the teaching they received they're grateful but and they receive
1:07:44
D but when it comes to certain things selfish ambition
1:07:50
I want to do this they've already decided
1:07:56
they're not asking God they're not open to God like is this your will how do I walk in this air do I
1:08:02
go here do I start this ministry you know they're just running
1:08:09
and they're not open like Lord speak to me how you want to speak to me like speak to me because if you come that way
1:08:15
and let's say you are able you're in a place where you're able to have access you're able to like ask questions to
1:08:21
your spiritual father or mother which by the way I do a subscriber Q and A Live every usually every week
1:08:29
I'm traveling like crazy this month so it'll be sporadic but um like Friday at
1:08:36
5 PM Pacific time I'm doing a subscriber q a live on Instagram and this is where it's more intimate it's only for
1:08:42
subscribers um and so there's not a million people on asking tons of questions like
1:08:49
if you ask your a question there's a good chance that I'll that I'll see it and answer it this is what the
1:08:54
subscriber q a lives are is people as I just open up for Q a like a mentorship time at a time where you can ask
1:08:59
questions and people write in the comments they're questions and I answer them live
1:09:05
so by the way because I know I'm I'm a spiritual mom to many of you out there
1:09:10
you don't you you don't need to be um like on the phone with your spiritual
1:09:17
mom or dad for them to be your spiritual mom or dad um a spiritual mother or father is the
1:09:24
leader of the church where you are planted where God has called you to be planted
1:09:30
to receive from and and to have a covering over and so if you are planned
1:09:37
at FIFA church I'm your spiritual mother and I'm so honored to be um and so
1:09:42
if you do have questions you know that subscribe subscriber q a is a great place to ask questions
1:09:49
and you can email but it's not like a we we don't have a huge team answering emails
1:09:55
right now but like if there's something really pressing you can you can email
1:10:01
um and like there's a chance I might be able to see it and respond but just to
1:10:06
be aware we get so many emails that's why I say subscriber q a is a is a good one
1:10:11
um and if you want to subscribe just go to my Instagram and on the right side there's a subscribe button just hit
1:10:17
subscribe so um yeah so this is where a lot of people
1:10:24
miss it they don't they don't surrender certain things like usually it's selfish ambition things
1:10:31
and so they it doesn't even like come to them
1:10:36
to ask God and to if God's leading many times to ask to
1:10:42
have the risk the the honor to respect and respect to ask a spiritual father mother like is this okay is this right
1:10:50
um is this safe in the spiritual realm if there's that question and also that also includes just
1:10:57
listening to the teaching too like when you listen to the teaching like today you should
1:11:02
come with an open child like teachable heart so that if there was like impurities of
1:11:08
your heart for example that as you're listening today because you came with that heart of not
1:11:14
not like I just don't need anybody I can hear God on my own I can do everything on my own
1:11:20
only all the time but um but you come with this heart of like Lord speak to me
1:11:25
I want to hear from you I want you to correct me through Apostle Catherine right now for example when you come with
1:11:31
that heart you'll be able to hear God speak to you what he wants to speak and you'll be able to to to be led into all
1:11:38
truth and led into his will amen amen hallelujah
1:11:44
Hallelujah so these are some
1:11:51
big keys of how you can be humble and and areas you can spot out where
1:11:57
there's potential where there is pride or potential for Pride the red flags this will help you evaluate your heart
1:12:03
daily and live in the fear of God and this is this is this is what is needed to receive the
1:12:10
anointing so when you take this word I share today seriously you will see God
1:12:15
pour out the anointing in your life in ways that will really surprise you and Amaze you and shock you
1:12:21
Hallelujah
1:12:26
