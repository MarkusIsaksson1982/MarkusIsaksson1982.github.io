hi I'm Apostle Catherine and welcome to
0:32
another episode of Revival is now it is
0:36
God's will for you to have Abundant Life
0:39
in every area we see in the book of Acts
0:42
that the children of God were walking in
0:43
Abundant Life if they were sick they
0:46
were being healed by God's power if they
0:48
were oppressed they were being delivered
0:49
demons are being cast out they were
0:51
walking in Abundant Life now in this
0:54
revival God is restoring his power to
0:57
heal deliver and release Abundant Life
1:00
so I've been teaching you now that it is
1:03
here his power is here to release
1:06
healing and freedom how to access it and
1:10
on the last episode you learned the
1:12
importance of walking in Authority one
1:15
of them major things Jesus did on the
1:17
cross was give you authority over the
1:19
devil and so if you want to walk in
1:21
Abundant Life you have to walk in
1:24
authority and constantly reject the
1:26
devil's lies constantly reject the
1:29
devil's portion what he wants for your
1:31
life you have to keep rejecting it and
1:33
keep walking in that authority of I want
1:37
God's will today I'm going to teach you
1:40
how to walk in authority to learn how to
1:45
walk in authority where we need to go is
1:48
the word of God in the beginning God
1:51
created the whole universe and in the
1:54
beginning it was just God and so
1:57
obviously God was the one in authority
2:00
and as he creates he's he does something
2:03
powerful he speaks let there be light he
2:09
speaks this he doesn't just think it he
2:13
does an action of speaking talking and
2:16
when he spoke there was light as he said
2:19
let there be light boom there was light
2:22
and he goes on and continues to speak
2:24
and speaks creation into existence this
2:27
is our first example of what walking
2:29
Authority looks like God speaks there
2:33
was so much power and so much change
2:36
just by a simple word the tongue can
2:39
bring death or life Jesus has returned
2:42
authority to you because God gave
2:45
authority originally to Adam and Eve he
2:47
said let them have dominion authority
2:50
over creation Jesus returned that
2:53
authority to you you are in God's image
2:55
so just as God spoke when you speak your
2:59
words carry so much power your words
3:04
carry life or death literally in the
3:09
spiritual realm if you could see your
3:11
words if you could see like fight or
3:14
coming out of your mouth you would be
3:16
shocked
3:17
power of the every word you speak so the
3:21
meaning of your words can bring life or
3:23
death is if you are speaking life which
3:27
is God's will if you're speaking in
3:30
agreement with God's word his heart his
3:34
promises you are speaking life and you
3:38
are bringing life because you're given
3:40
Authority God's promises God's will
3:43
comes through you you partner with God
3:46
because God has chosen to use us on this
3:48
Earth so every word you speak is either
3:51
partnering with God and bringing Heaven
3:54
down and God's will to come to pass or
3:58
your words are death and the meaning of
4:01
that is agreeing with the devil's will
4:03
agreeing with the devil's lies and when
4:06
you do that you are literally accepting
4:10
and pushing forth the devil's plans for
4:14
your life and others lives around you
4:16
the tongue can bring death or life those
4:18
who love to talk will reap the
4:20
consequences that's meaning those who
4:22
love to talk but they're not thinking
4:23
about what they're saying and they're
4:26
just talking they're saying whatever
4:27
they're going to reap this the careless
4:30
words that they say if they love to talk
4:32
and they're not thinking about what
4:34
they're saying the words of death are
4:35
coming out
4:36
there are
4:38
seeds that are being planted of death
4:40
that they will reap those words of death
4:43
in their life now we're going to look at
4:45
the example of Jesus Jesus when he came
4:46
to this earth one of the big things he
4:48
did not only was to save us but also to
4:53
be an example for us of what being a
4:57
disciple of the Lord looks like he was
5:00
demonstrating to us how to walk in
5:04
authority when Jesus is on this Earth
5:06
he's constantly walking in authority and
5:08
destroying the devil's works and
5:10
bringing the father's will to come to
5:13
pass so all these times that Jesus is
5:15
healing delivering preaching he's
5:17
walking in Authority through all of this
5:19
in Mark 4 39 Jesus was with the
5:22
disciples they were in a boat there was
5:24
a big storm like a scary storm dangerous
5:27
and Jesus just he gets up
5:31
he rebuked the wind and said to the Sea
5:34
hush be still
5:37
so Jesus spoke to the storm to the
5:42
threat upon his and his disciples lives
5:44
he spoke he spoke with authority those
5:48
are authoritative words and it says and
5:50
the wind died down and there was at once
5:54
a great calm Jesus demonstrated to us
5:57
how to walk in authority and see the
6:01
threats of the devil completely vanish
6:03
because the devil has to obey the
6:07
authority of Jesus Christ Jesus's friend
6:09
and disciple Lazarus he had died too
6:12
early it wasn't his time yet to go to
6:14
heaven this was a work of the devil he
6:17
died but Jesus
6:19
he rose him from the dead and how did he
6:23
do this it says in John 11 43 then with
6:27
a loud voice Jesus shouted with
6:29
authority Lazarus come out of the Tomb
6:34
so he used his words and spoke these
6:37
words with authority once again
6:38
authoritative words and as he's doing
6:41
this he's basically saying death you
6:43
can't hold him down it's not lazarus's
6:46
time yet and Lazarus rose from the dead
6:48
and when we look at Jesus casting out
6:50
demons he also is speaking speaking with
6:54
authority he had been saying to him the
6:57
demon come out of the man you unclean
7:01
Spirit he's speaking to the Demonic
7:03
spirit and commanding the spirit to go
7:07
time and time again throughout the
7:09
gospels we see Jesus doing this this is
7:12
how he's casting out demons is he's
7:14
speaking speaking with authority demons
7:16
goat and they have to obey the commands
7:19
of Jesus there was a person who was deaf
7:22
and mute and once again Jesus speaks he
7:24
speaks to open up the ears and the mouth
7:27
be opened and released and one time a
7:31
centurion Soldier comes to Jesus and he
7:34
says Lord my servant is lying at home
7:36
paralyzed with intense and terrible
7:38
tormenting pain
7:40
Jesus said to him I will come and heal
7:43
him like I will come in person and pray
7:46
for him
7:47
but the Centurion replied to him Lord I
7:50
am not worthy to have you come under my
7:52
roof but only say the word and my
7:56
servant will be healed for I also am a
7:59
man subject to Authority with soldiers
8:01
subject to me and I say to one go and he
8:05
goes and to another come and he comes
8:07
and to my slave do this and he does it
8:10
when Jesus heard this he was amazed and
8:12
said to those who are following him I
8:14
tell you truthfully I have not found
8:16
such great faith as this with anyone in
8:19
Israel Jesus says to the Centurion go it
8:22
will be done for you as you believed and
8:24
the servant was restored to Health at
8:25
that very hour this Centurion Soldier he
8:29
rejects Jesus's proposal to come in
8:33
person and heal a servant because he had
8:36
revelation of what actually made the
8:41
sickness the demonic spirits to go it
8:44
was the authority that Jesus carried
8:48
that's why the Centurion Soldier is
8:50
bringing up all these examples of him
8:52
walking in Authority he's saying I
8:54
understand what actually makes sickness
8:56
go and demons go it is not something in
9:00
the Physical Realm it's not about you
9:02
being near a person but it's about the
9:06
authority you carry and then the
9:08
Centurion Soldier goes on to say I'm a
9:10
person of authority and not just that he
9:13
goes on to say you know this is how I
9:15
execute Authority I just speak something
9:17
I speak something simply and things
9:21
happen my soldiers obey me my soldiers
9:24
obey the words and get things done he's
9:27
revealing how his spiritual eyes were
9:29
opened he knows what will make his
9:32
servant be healed is Jesus executing his
9:35
authority by speaking words that's it
9:39
that that's all that's needed that's the
9:42
key that's what brings healing
9:45
Deliverance the will of God change is by
9:50
using your Authority
9:51
and by using your Authority you speak
9:54
Jesus
9:56
is amazed you can see Jesus is just
9:59
blessed by this Centurion soldier's
10:01
faith Jesus was like he gets it and
10:04
Jesus was so excited because you know he
10:07
says I've I've not found such great
10:09
faith wow that this is the example of
10:12
finding such great faith
10:14
yes because
10:16
this guy has the kind of faith that
10:18
works you can believe in Jesus just that
10:22
he exists but that kind of faith alone
10:25
you won't see healing and deliverance
10:28
you need to believe specifically in
10:31
Jesus that Jesus is your healer and
10:33
deliverer to begin to receive healing
10:36
and deliverance
10:38
but also you cannot just stop at Jesus
10:40
as my healer and deliverer you need to
10:43
understand have faith in the way that
10:46
Jesus releases his miracles Jesus uses
10:50
vessels he puts anointing and Authority
10:52
in vessels
10:54
he says to his disciples I've given you
10:56
Authority now to cast that demons to
10:58
heal the sick so the big way that we are
11:01
seeing miracles happen how we saw it in
11:02
the ACT Church how we're seeing it now
11:04
in this revival
11:05
is by God using vessels with anointing
11:09
and authority and those vessels
11:12
speaking executing their Authority by
11:15
speaking it's not really about physical
11:17
touch it's not about one-on-one prayer
11:20
it is simply about an anointed vessel of
11:24
God executing their Authority properly
11:26
speaking with authority this Centurion
11:30
Soldier had Faith to receive any kind of
11:33
miracle
11:34
other people would not have the faith to
11:37
receive the miracle of just Jesus
11:39
speaking and they wouldn't receive it
11:41
Jesus would have to go in person Jesus
11:44
can do more miracles now if everyone can
11:47
have this kind of Faith this proper kind
11:49
of faith of really what makes God's will
11:52
be done healing Deliverance happen
11:55
Darkness flee and then we see Jesus
11:58
teaching his disciples about walking in
12:01
authority and the power of their words
12:04
truly I tell you whoever says to this
12:08
mountain be lifted up and thrown into
12:11
the sea and does not doubt it all in his
12:14
heart but believes that what he says
12:17
will take place it will be done for him
12:20
Jesus does not say whoever believes that
12:23
I the father will move the mountain it
12:27
will be moved Jesus specifically says
12:30
whoever says to this mountain be lifted
12:33
and thrown into the sea
12:35
and does not doubt in his heart would
12:37
but believes that what he says will take
12:40
place it will be done for him so Jesus
12:42
is is teaching his disciples right now
12:45
your words carry power I have given you
12:48
Authority and this is how you need to
12:51
walk in authority by speaking and when
12:53
you do this because I've given you
12:55
Authority your words carry so much power
12:58
that even a whole Mountain could be
13:01
thrown into the sea
13:03
and this is speaking of mountains in the
13:05
spiritual realm mountains of demonic
13:08
strongholds oppressions dry Barren land
13:12
we know that salvation comes by grace
13:13
through faith but it is really
13:16
everything that Jesus wants to give you
13:18
you receive it by grace through faith so
13:22
you need to believe that Jesus has given
13:25
you Authority you need to believe that
13:29
your words carry power and this is how
13:31
you execute your Authority you need to
13:34
believe that what you say will happen
13:38
when you believe that you have authority
13:40
that your words carry power that what
13:42
you says will happen
13:43
then it will happen I vividly remember
13:46
the day that I received this Revelation
13:49
from God I heard a message about the
13:51
power of your words like you're hearing
13:53
today and as I was hearing that word my
13:57
spiritual eyes opened up and understood
13:59
that Revelation it's like I became like
14:02
the Centurion Soldier where I got it
14:06
leave
14:08
from that day forward
14:10
I became so careful over my words from
14:16
that day
14:17
I was changed because of this Revelation
14:20
I received and the fear of God came over
14:22
me
14:23
where I was such a talkative person most
14:27
of us are natural in Instinct we love to
14:29
talk we love to just be with our friends
14:31
and just talk and talk and just talk
14:34
about whatever sometimes it feels good
14:36
to talk sometimes it feels good to be
14:38
heard sometimes there's gossiping that
14:40
happens sometimes complaining feels good
14:44
this is of the flesh I'm speaking this
14:46
is what's like instinct of the flesh and
14:50
without spiritual maturity it feels like
14:53
no big problem to just complain once in
14:56
a while just say whatever whatever's on
14:58
your mind however you feel but the truth
15:01
is this your words carry death or life
15:04
you will eat from your from your words
15:06
either poison or fruit and so I at the
15:09
time seven years ago was a very
15:11
talkative person
15:12
and when I grabbed this Revelation I
15:15
became so quiet and I only spoke with
15:19
intention every time I spoke I had to
15:21
make sure
15:23
it aligns with God's word
15:25
it's pleasing to God the Bible says let
15:28
the words of my mouth the meditation of
15:30
my heart be pleasing to you it had to be
15:33
edifying somebody
15:34
had to be speaking life over myself
15:37
never death it had to be only speaking
15:39
life over other people and when I
15:42
started Living with this intention every
15:44
day I Saw My Life Begin to change
15:48
now I can tell you that I am truly
15:52
walking an abundant life in every area
15:55
and the biggest reason I've been able to
15:59
see this happen in my life because I
16:01
started speaking with such intention
16:04
because I started taking such care over
16:09
every word I spoke
16:11
so practically how should you walk in
16:14
authority with your words every time the
16:17
devil is attacking you in your life
16:18
attacking your inheritance from Jesus
16:21
you need to speak up this is the action
16:23
of resisting the devil and he will flee
16:25
from you speaking sickness must lead my
16:28
body pain must lead my body depression
16:30
must get out anxiety must leave my mind
16:33
Jesus has given me perfect peace Jesus
16:36
has given me a sound mind Jesus has
16:39
given me Abundant Health by his stripes
16:42
I am healed I declare all lack out of my
16:46
life Jesus has provided for me all that
16:50
I need I have abundance in every area
16:53
this includes my finances I declare
16:55
there to be abundance in my bank account
16:59
there will not be division in my family
17:01
in my marriage our family my marriage we
17:05
will be United I love my children you
17:09
can be feeling so frustrated at them
17:11
inside but you speak I love them you
17:14
could you could go in your room and just
17:16
speak I love them I bless them I declare
17:19
Unity as you are speaking these words as
17:23
you are rejecting the devil with your
17:24
words and as you are speaking God's will
17:27
you are using your Authority you are
17:29
saying devil there's no Open Door you're
17:32
gonna come in I'm locking all the doors
17:34
and I am declaring I'm using my
17:37
authority and saying God's will must be
17:39
done in my life in my family no matter
17:41
what the devil's will will never be done
17:44
in my family you're putting your foot
17:46
down you're executing your Authority and
17:48
because Jesus is giving you you
17:50
authority over the devil
17:52
devil must flee your feelings many times
17:55
are not your own but they are lies from
17:58
the devil your thoughts many times are
18:00
not your own but they are lies from the
18:02
devil so you need to be aware of the
18:04
every lie in your mind of the every
18:07
attack of the devil and you need to take
18:10
authority over it all I reject that
18:14
impure desire and thought and craving in
18:17
my head right now I reject every thought
18:20
of hate and jealousy and envy and
18:23
selfishness I bless the person you are
18:27
having feelings of jealousy or hate for
18:28
Speak Life over them this is the action
18:31
of you saying devil you're not going to
18:34
come and bring Yokes in my life you're
18:38
not going to have your way with my life
18:40
God's will must be done in my life this
18:43
is a big like rewiring you need to do in
18:46
your head your mind I mean the Bible
18:48
says renew your mind with the word of
18:50
God so you are having your mind renewed
18:53
right now and this is very new for many
18:55
of you you have to spend time to get
18:58
this to be so in you for what has been
19:01
stored up in your hearts will be heard
19:03
in the Overflow of your words so to make
19:06
sure what you're speaking is life you
19:09
need to meditate on the right things the
19:12
right things are the word of God the
19:14
right things are the word of God present
19:17
tense like this is a Rhema word that
19:19
means present tense what you're hearing
19:21
today is a present tense word of God
19:22
bringing Revelation from the logos
19:24
written word of God you need to meditate
19:27
on what I'm speaking today
19:29
get this in you so it's in your heart so
19:32
it's stored up in your heart so it just
19:34
becomes an overflow out of you it's like
19:37
if you swear a lot you can't hide it you
19:41
can try to be all prim and proper in
19:43
front of important people but
19:45
eventually it's going to come out in the
19:48
same way if you never swear the swear
19:51
words are not even in your vocabulary so
19:53
even when pressure comes and normal
19:57
people would swear so much naturally
20:00
fast
20:01
those words are not even in you there
20:03
was a time I
20:05
I remember I would stub my toe and it
20:08
would really hurt and I would mean but I
20:12
would start praying in tongues and I
20:14
didn't even like try to do it but I was
20:16
like oh Hallelujah I was like really
20:19
excited you know what what had been in
20:22
my heart was good like I had been
20:24
practicing brain in the spirit and I
20:26
would just focusing on Jesus so much
20:28
that
20:29
it that's what was in my heart it came
20:31
out so your whole life you might not
20:33
have had much care over your words today
20:36
you need to decide to make a complete
20:39
change a 360. and every day start with
20:43
the intention in your mind and your
20:45
heart I'm gonna walk in authority today
20:47
that Jesus has given me
20:49
I'm going to walk in authority by
20:52
speaking I'm going to make sure that all
20:54
of my words are words of Life all of my
20:56
words are aligning with God's will I'm
20:59
going to make sure every attack of the
21:01
enemy that comes I'm not going to let
21:02
him just come I'm gonna reject him like
21:06
a policeman or woman I'm gonna take him
21:09
captive Every Lie every thought captive
21:12
and make it obedient to Christ I am not
21:15
allowing the Devil to come in any room
21:17
of my house he can't camp out sneak in I
21:20
am being strict I am using my authority
21:23
and when I hear the knock on the door to
21:24
try to come in I'm gonna speak and say
21:27
leave my house alone leave my temple of
21:30
the Holy Spirit alone and get out of
21:32
here as you read God's word you're
21:34
meditating on it you're getting his
21:37
heart his will in you in your heart make
21:40
this practice of spending time in the
21:42
word of God and with the Revelation that
21:44
you're getting God's will in you so you
21:47
become just this vessel of authority
21:49
who's just naturally walking in God's
21:52
authority never slipping up and speaking
21:56
a word of death when I first started
21:58
taking it so seriously the words I spoke
22:00
I had to think about it a lot I had to
22:02
like stop myself from speaking any word
22:04
of death it was like work you know it
22:07
took a lot of care a lot of attention
22:10
intention but as I kept doing that
22:14
spiritual work kept obeying god with
22:17
every step with every word
22:20
I was transformed this practice that was
22:22
first foreign started to become me I
22:26
mean it started to become so natural so
22:30
like now I don't have to try and think
22:32
so hard words of death aren't a part of
22:35
me just words of life and so that's how
22:38
it will be for you and this is how you
22:39
will really be thriving in God's
22:42
Abundant Life and the devil can't come
22:45
in any area because you've been so
22:48
transformed to be so much like Jesus
22:50
that there's no way he can sneak in and
22:53
find a word of death you're pure you're
22:56
full of life you're overflowing with
22:59
life and the words of Jesus I know as
23:01
you put this into practice you will see
23:04
your life transform and even quickly so
23:07
obey Jesus in this way with excitement
23:10
with joy and may your prayer every day
23:13
be let the words of my mouth the
23:16
meditation of my heart be pleasing to
23:18
you Lord and I use my Authority that
23:21
Jesus has given me to command Darkness
23:24

23:27
word curse that you spoke over your life
23:30
your future your family a big curse
23:34
right now that God is breaking is the
23:37
word curse of death of suicide
23:40
there's some of you watching who have
23:43
said the words I want to die and when
23:46
you speak I want to die you're actually
23:48
making a covenant with a demon of
23:51
suicide of death and so to be free from
23:54
that to be free from the suicidal
23:56
thoughts and that curse and Covenant you
23:59
need to renounce
24:01
speaking those words and also if there
24:04
