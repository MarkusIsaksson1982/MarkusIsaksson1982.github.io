1:24

1:30

1:37

1:50
is really a on message guide of how to cast out demons and heal the sick
1:58
Hallelujah all right so um back to this this this
2:04
scripture here this is the commission that God has given us that we should
2:09
preach not just anything but preach that the kingdom of God is at hand meaning
2:14
Jesus is Alive the what is happening in heaven healing Freedom Abundant Life no
2:22
uh devil can Reign there that's happening here when One Believes In Jesus when one comes to Jesus they
2:28
receive Heaven on Earth the the reward the the the uh the characteristics of
2:34
Heaven and the works of the devil destroyed in their life praise God so
2:41
our job is to preach not just anything but that the kingdom of God is at hand
2:47
healing is at hand freedom is at hand encounters with Jesus tangibly is in
2:52
hand Abundant Life is at hand Hallelujah so we preach and then we are also called
2:58
to demonstrate to be a vessel of God so that they can actually receive the
3:03
Kingdom at hand so that they can receive the healing and freedom God chooses to use vessels so we must
3:10
then heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out demons so we
3:16
tell them the kingdom of Heaven's at at hand and then we release it to them
3:21
that's what God is calling all of us to do every one of us all who believe the
3:26
Bible says these signs shall follow them and some of these signs is they shall lay hands on the sick and be healed they
3:31
shall cast out demons all who believe anyone believe here so these signs should be
3:39
accompanying you you should be doing these things praise God Ephesians
3:47
411 this is the passion translation says and he Jesus has appointed some with
3:54
grace to be Apostles and some with grace to be prophets and some with grace to to
3:59
be evangelists and some with grace to be pastors he's given these gifts to the
4:05
church and some Grace to be teachers he's given these gifts to the church to
4:10
the Saints and their calling is to nurture and prepare all the holy
4:15
Believers to do their own works of ministry and as they do this they will
4:22
enlarge and build up the body of Christ so we need the five-fold ministry which
4:28
includes the Apostles and Prophets to train equip and equip the
4:35
Believers you to do your own works of ministry to be able to
4:41
do what the the previous verse heal the sick cast out demons preach that the kingdom of God is at hand a big reason
4:48
why we are not seeing me most Believers preach the right kind of preaching that the kingdom of God is at hand and
4:55
Healing The Sick and casting out demons is because they're missing the fightful ministry they're missing the the
5:02
apostles and the prophets which are the the the ones that really so much
5:08
mature the bride M the Believers equip
5:13
for works of service as the Bible says the true sign of an apostle is that they walk in signs wonders and miracles it
5:19
says that specifically for Apostles so if that's the true sign of of an apostle that also mean that they will be the
5:25
ones primarily bringing the equipping for others to do their own
5:30
works of ministry in the in the vein of the power of God Healing The Sick cast out demons signs wonders Miracles
5:37
amen so this is what's happening today this is Apostolic Ministry
5:43
happening today for you today you are being equipped to do your own works of
5:51
ministry Hallelujah this is what church is
5:56
supposed to be like praise God
6:02
so um if someone asks me you know how to cast out demons and heal the sick I
6:10
would say to them that's not the right question the right question is how to
6:15
receive the anointing that makes demons obey you and go and sicknesses
6:23
leave so today I am teaching you how to cast out demons and heal the sick there is a way to do it rightly effectively
6:31
according to how God wants it needs it to be done but the bulk the main part of
6:40
like like how to cast out demons and heal the sick
6:45
is receiving the anointing my my book here the secret of
6:51
the anointing the majority of the book is about how to receive the anointing
7:00
and then a small part of it is actually the how to cast out demons heal the
7:06
sick and that matches the truth of how it is like in
7:11
the spiritual realm when you have once you have the anointing things are
7:17
easy demons start manifesting and for you to cast them out
7:23
is rather simple is not very complex the howto's of it amen
7:30
so the the anointing is what is vital and so God doesn't give the
7:35
anointing to anybody you have to have a pure trustworthy heart so that's
7:41
important for you to know like if you yourself are like I want to be casting out demons how do I do this you need to
7:47
change your your mind your thinking into I want to be a vessel of the anointing
7:53
so God can use me and then the you don't have to worry about it the demons will
7:59
just start manifesting and you just simply command him to go pretty much sometimes there's more to it which I'm
8:04
going to teach today but it's it's just so simple once the anointing is there
8:09
once the anointing is there I remember my first time seeing a demon manifest it was in the park March 20 in March 2021
8:18
and I'm just I'm just ministering as usual and all of a sudden this demon just starts manifesting and I simply command the
8:25
demon to go and it left it was so simple even the first time even before I had gotten this like serious training of the
8:33
how to casting out of demons because what I've learned is um God wants you to
8:39
remain humble and lean on him and not be a
8:45
professional demon Caster outer before the first demon manifests
8:50
before you but that you would just be humble every time like realizing you need God
8:58
and you need need your spiritual father or mother I God uh you know did things
9:04
this way for me so I could know I need the Holy Spirit and I also need my spiritual father it's not like all right
9:11
now the anointing is here peace spiritual father no I I I need to know
9:18
answers I need to know what to do with this demonic case and God many times would have the answer in my spiritual
9:25
father that's how he that's how God would speak to me and how I grew in wisdom and how I grew
9:31
to this place where now I can teach you these things of how to cast out demons
9:38
amen
9:44
hallelujah acts 19:13 there's a story in the Bible where
9:50
the Jews Jews went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who are
9:56
demon-possessed they would say in the name of the Jesus whom Paul preaches I command you to come out seven sons of
10:03
ska a Jewish Chief priest were doing this one day the evil spirit answered them Jesus I know and Paul I know
10:11
about but who are you then the man who had the evil spirit
10:17
jumped on them and overpowered them all he gave them such a beating that they
10:22
ran out of the house naked and bleeding so um you need the anointing so
10:29
that demons recognize you and Obey you and you can actually cast out demons number one but you also need the
10:35
anointing number two for protection because this principle yes
10:42
they were Jewish right but still when you're a Believer you still need to
10:48
follow God's principles his commands or you open up doors and you become like PE
10:55
like these people who are Jewish by his by God's principles I mean um
11:03
that you would surrender to him that you would not do Christianity Your Own Way relationship with God your own way but
11:11
you would make priority what God makes priority like his church like being
11:16
equipped and so planting yourself in a church where God is really moving in
11:22
power and coming continually weekly Hallelujah so that's one of the
11:27
principles I mean and when you do this the anointing is is coming upon your life touching every area a a and also
11:36
coming over your life for protection it's the covering a covering
11:42
comes over you when you abide by God's principles such as this one planting
11:48
yourself where God's power is so I remember I've seen people before come saying I'm a pastor and I've Min and I
11:55
would Minister and but my wife here was cursed CED by a
12:00
witch but how can that happen right well if there is not anointing in one's life
12:07
if they're not having a covering a true covering where true anointing
12:12
is then there is an Open Door for these things to
12:19
happen so that's a big importance when you when you have the covering of the anointing you don't need to be worrying
12:25
about enemies you can you can have enemies that you could have a neighbor that's doing witchcraft and you don't
12:31
need to worry any at all not just because of the blood of
12:36
Jesus not just because you're a Believer simply but because you're following
12:41
God's principles so then these things come then the protection the covering of
12:49
anointing comes so that covering of anointing where you are planted that
12:54
powerful anointing where demons can't stay that same powerful anointing is now covering you and so if a witch
13:03
tries to uh curse you it will come back at the witch or warlock it cannot touch
13:10
they are not allowed to in the spiritual realm you are going by God's principles and laws and so you're safe
13:19
there Hallelujah so if you if you are not
13:27
abiding by God's principles like being planted having a covering of anointing
13:32
and you just go trying to cast out demons the demons see that you are
13:38
outside of the principles of God and therefore it's an open door and therefore they can have legal access to
13:45
mess with you like this scripture says so it's not
13:50
safe for a lukewarm believer a Believer maybe who's excited about casting out demons but not serious about surrender
13:57
who's not planted where God's power is it's not safe for them to go start addressing demons confronting demons
14:05
because they see in this spiritual realm they see like Paul I see I I know Paul I
14:11
know I have to obey him I know Jesus I know I have to obey him but who are you
14:17
so they see they see the anointing you carry and the anointing that covers
14:25
[Applause] you
14:31
all right so now um when it comes to casting out
14:36
demons and Healing The Sick the first point I must I I'm sharing with you now
14:43
is that you must follow the Holy
14:48
Spirit like you should not go on a mission like I feel like casting out demons
14:54
today there's a lot of homeless people who really need freedom I just feel like going there and casting out demons today
15:01
we shouldn't go by our feelings ever but we should go by the leading of the holy
15:08
spirit this is so important um when it comes to Ministry
15:14
in general when it comes to the gifts that we are using the the gifts of the holy spirit that we are ministering with
15:21
we must be following the Holy Spirit and not our preference not how we
15:26
feel when I was ministering for about four years or so three and a half
15:33
four years before the first demon manifested the way I was ministering the
15:39
way the Holy Spirit was leading me to minister to the five to 20 people that were there depending on the year was I
15:47
would preach the message and then after the message I would call sometimes we would have a new
15:53
person it was usually more like a new person um sometimes someone who had been there for a while but I would call them
15:59
forward and I would just speak prophetically over them I would speak prophetic words over them sometimes I
16:06
would say I see depression this must leave you but there was it wasn't like now when I say depression must go where
16:13
there's like a demon manifesting many times and someone falling back with the power of God and them yelling I'm free
16:19
it wasn't like that I mean God wasn't ready to use me I wasn't ready God I
16:25
wasn't ready God wasn't ready to use me in the way he then used me um started
16:30
using me in 2021 with casting out of demons and Healing The Sick but so when I would pray for people
16:37
I would speak simple prophetic words and and that was it that that was
16:42
really just how I was ministering it was no like I break this curse I detach you from these things do
16:50
you want to renounce anything I was none of that but then the first demon
16:56
manifested and holy spirit changed changed gears and he said follow me here in this new way like
17:04
that Hallelujah and so that one woman that
17:09
that that was the first one that was set free at fivefold church when we were in the park um I prayed for her like I
17:15
usually would pray for people and she fell back which some people I would see that happen sometimes but then she
17:21
started trembling I never seen that before like her whole body convulsing looking like she was having a seizure
17:26
and then I discerned holy Spirit gave me discernment to see these are demons manifesting in her first time I've seen
17:33
that in my Ministry and so I just immediately was like okay Holy Spirit
17:39
listening to you now we're going a different direction now and he led me to
17:45
confront the demon for the first time in my life and I I ended up saying get up
17:51
because like sometimes you you are that's a way to to um make the demon know their place stand up now because
17:59
the demon was saying um I don't want her to preach and was just whining so
18:05
sometimes God will lead you to walk in your Authority in a way where you're you're showing your Authority that the
18:13
demon cannot do what the Deon what he want what it wants it can't be just
18:18
whining and talking and talking get in your place stand up and then I said you
18:23
must go now that was first time ever confronted
18:28
a demon and the demon left her and moved with such Force out of her that she went
18:34
hard on the ground it was so Supernatural because it looked like someone pushed her but it was the force of the demon leaving her which there's a
18:40
story in the Bible that happens like that where where that same exact thing happened a demon left someone with such
18:46
force a person fell down and they were like is is he dead and then Jesus says
18:51
no just sleeping get up you can get up and that happened she actually immediately went right to sleep her head
18:57
fell on the G gentleman who was sitting down his foot God is so good to make it a soft
19:04
Landing yeah yeah right on because it was with such Force um and we didn't
19:09
have any experience we'd have catchers back then jeanal was there on the camera
19:17
capturing it and we had like you were the only one serving I think at that time yeah you were the only one serving
19:24
so it's just Shantal and then we have 15 people 20 people there I think so yeah and then
19:31
everything changed so after that day pretty much every single Sunday demons
19:36
were manifesting and so Holy Spirit Led me it's time to cast out demons it's time
19:43
to free these people and so um and then in a short time like a couple months later 300
19:50
people came I mean we had 15 people and then 2 months later 300 people came and
19:56
and so many I mean so many of them most of them needed Freedom they came hungry for freedom and so there was demons
20:03
manifesting everywhere and so I had to really follow the holy spirit with this
20:08
changing of Gears I wasn't ministering this way at all and then all of a sudden overnight I'm ministering completely
20:15
differently because this is how God wants to use me now and so um this is
20:21
just something I want to share like before it was so much prophetic so much prophetic and then it just came to be
20:26
simply go be free be be free be free be free because it's an
20:31
emergency God doesn't want people staying where they're demons anymore this is priority this is emergency this
20:37
is life or death especially people with suicidal demons it's literally life or
20:44
death and so I had to really change and so I I want to share with you it's so
20:50
important that you are following the Holy Spirit and that you are not wanting to cast out demons or minister to people
20:57
your own way or your favorite gift or the gift you think that you are the strongest in let's say you have a a
21:04
powerful prophetic gift but God is calling you to focus more on setting
21:10
people free and you you just can't prophesy to everyone for a long
21:15
time you have to be obedient you don't get to choose the
21:20
gifts that that you want to use to minister to someone it's up to God and
21:26
so he'll give you many different gifts but you must always be sensitive to the holy spirit with what he wants to do
21:33
it's not about showing off your gift it's about being a vessel for God to do
21:38
what he wants to
21:44
do amen hallelujah praise God so that's the
21:50
first point now I'm going to go into casting out demons specifically how to
21:57
cast out demons so number
22:03
one above all you must have a heart for the person to be free and
22:10
healed not I want to cast out demons and heal the
22:16
sick amen so
22:24
um what I want to share with you today is not to teach you how do you cast out demons but I'm going
22:32
to teach you what to do when you see someone oppressed so that they can be
22:38
free so sometimes that will mean you cast out the
22:44
demon sometimes it doesn't mean that because we are in a kingdom of
22:51
God kingdom we aren't like individual istic
22:59
Christians but we are part of a kingdom Hallelujah
23:05
and in Ephesians 612 for we do not wrestle against flesh
23:12
and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this age against spiritual
23:18
hosts of wickedness in the Heavenly places so as I shared a couple week a few weeks
23:24
ago this scripture is showing different levels of demonic powers in the
23:30
spiritual realm principalities being the highest then Powers then rulers of the
23:35
darkness of this age and then spiritual hosts of wickedness in the Heavenly places there are different levels of
23:42
demonic powers and there's also different levels of anointing that one
23:47
carries according to their purpose what God has called them to do on this Earth
23:54
and also according to their surrender what they will be allowed ing for God to put how much anointing they'll allow God
24:01
to put in them based on their surrender and also according to the timeline of I mean like you can be
24:08
called to carry such a mighty anointing that deals with principalities but that won't happen
24:14
overnight so you might not be at that level yet just because you're in the process still
24:20
amen so it's important a lot of people don't realize this they just think we're all called to cast out demons so we
24:27
should I'll be able to cast out any kind of demon and a lot of people will say you don't need to go to a Revival event or
24:34
that go to a person to receive Deliverance you can just receive Deliverance
24:39
yourself but that's not understanding the kingdom of God that's not
24:45
understanding the spiritual realm the reality the reality that there are different levels of demonic Powers the
24:52
reality that God puts different levels of anointing to deal with each level
24:58
in his vessels like uh Apostle Paul it says God
25:03
was doing such extraordinary Miracles through his hands that even they would bring aprons and handkerchiefs to him
25:10
and demons would leave acts 1911 it says God was doing such extraordinary so
25:16
that's teaching us that he was dealing with the principalities he was at the high level
25:22
and he was an apostle so the the the apostles the prophets of fful Ministry
25:27
they will be the ones dealing with the principalities because they are the ones that are bringing the equipping and
25:33
impartation to the Believers so they have to be higher amen like how a
25:39
teacher has to be at a higher level of knowledge than the students right so
25:44
same with Peter they would go under his shadow and all were healed and freed a big reason is because he had the
25:51
anointing to even deal with the principalities now if he didn't have
25:57
such a strong anointing it probably wouldn't say all were healed and freed there could be some principalities there
26:03
that didn't match the level of anointing so you have to be aware of
26:09
this first of all when you see someone who was oppressed you have to have in your mind okay I can do this I'm called
26:16
to do this I'm called to cast this demon out no that's not thinking Kingdom
26:22
Minded and it's not really seen in the spirit you should instead have the heart
26:28
of I want to see this person free and I know I will see this person free cuz the
26:33
kingdom of God is at hand and I know about this great kingdom of God and so you you must know like maybe
26:43
that person has a demon at a demon that your anointing matches like like that
26:49
that it will obey but it could be that they have higher level demons and in that case the answer is is
26:57
going to be to bring them under Apostle Peter's shadow of today because it says in the Bible they brought in the acts
27:04
Church they brought the sick and Demon oppressed underneath the shadow of apostle Peter and just by being
27:10
positioned there all were healed all were freed so um that would be the
27:16
answer is to get them where you know high level anointing
27:22
is amen so you have to have this heart it's
27:27
very important or else you're not helping the person if you're instead
27:33
thinking about yourself I want to cast The Demon out you know you have to be
27:39
looking to Jesus not to yourself looking to Jesus for the
27:44
answers for this person and that's being Kingdom Minded
27:51
amen um and this is I mean the the bi the verse that says Matthew Matthew 7:21 not everyone
27:59
who says not everyone who says to me Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but the one who does the will of
28:05
my father who is in heaven on that day many will say to me Lord Lord did we not
28:11
prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and do many mighty works in your name and then will I
28:18
declare to them I never knew you to part from me you workers of
28:25
lawlessness and so some of these people people are the ones that are more focused on themselves instead of the
28:32
Kingdom I want to cast The Demon out I want to prophesy I want to flop my
28:39
spiritual gifts so you can start out pure you can
28:45
start out with the pure gifts but when you start moving in that
28:50
way of self-centeredness that becomes that open
28:56
door for the angel of Light the devil to start leading
29:03
you even we can go so far as devil even giving you demonic
29:09
powers and that's some of these people that um are are are we don't have it up
29:15
here but you know the verse that's some of those people that are the ones where Jesus says I never knew
29:21
you you were so much about the casting out of demons and prophesying
29:27
your own way for your gain to flaunt your
29:33
gifts and you weren't really looking to me and you weren't about my
29:38
kingdom so I ended up not knowing you you you were totally going a wall your
29:43
own way and not coming to me right so we have to be so careful
29:50
that we are about the kingdom and never
29:55
getting impressed with our GI gifts and wanting to use them for selfish
30:02
gain you have to be careful about this because it's real power it's real power
30:11
and it there there can be a Temptation sometimes
30:16
wow I look impressive I look successful I look
30:22
powerful you have to make sure you're you're you're coming with clean heart Clean Hands and Pure Heart rejecting
30:30
those selfish thoughts they can be coming from the devil not your own so
30:35
don't get down on yourself but reject any thought like that so you can stay
30:41
pure amen
30:47
hallelujah so number two number two how to cast out
30:55
demons you must operate in the principles or
31:02
laws of the spiritual realm you must operate in the principle or laws of the
31:11
spiritual realm God is a god of principles of laws
31:17
and they are in his word they're his commands but also we need Revelation
31:23
from the Holy Spirit like as I was sharing one of the
31:28
principles of being planted we find this through scripture about how it says that you will be like
31:33
a tree that is planted by streams of Living Water and in every season you will prosper your leaves will NE never
31:40
wither that's revelation of that the true revelation of the holy spirit is speaking of being planted in God's
31:47
church and not go in in in in one of his true churches and not going Here There and Everywhere You will prosper when you
31:55
abide by that principle another principle is sewing so many times God
32:00
speaks about the importance of sewing then you can reap when we withhold tithe
32:07
then the devil can mess with our finances and because we're robbing God this isn't the word Malachi it says you
32:14
are robbing God when you don't tithe and and then the de the devil can mess with the finances right so that's that's
32:21
another example of principle God is a principle principle of sewing a principle of being planted there's a lot
32:27
of different principles all in his word needing the Holy Spirit needing anointed
32:33
teachings to really open up your eyes to understand what God is speaking that's why we need the church that's why we
32:39
need the equipping from the five-fold ministry amen but God is a god of principles so many times people are
32:47
praying God heal me God deliver me God open this door God do this in my family
32:54
God crying crying God where are you why aren't you you doing anything and simply
32:59
the reason is because they are not abiding by God's principles he is strict
33:06
to his principles it's the same thing of how he he never stays he never changes
33:11
he always stays the same it's the same like principle of of he's a his he's
33:16
true to his promises so that's why I'm telling you he he adheres to his principles so when
33:24
we stay in line with his principles that's when we access his power that's
33:30
when we access the Miracles that's when we are able to
33:35
access the anointing effectively walk in the anointing and demons will actually obey and
33:41
leave when we abide in these principles and as I said before demons know when
33:47
you're outside of the principles and that's when they can mess around and not
33:55
obey so with with the casting out of demons you must operate in the principles and
34:01
laws of the spiritual realm in number one the principle of
34:09
authority now I've shared many messages about what real Authority in Christ
34:15
means and casting out demons and so make sure you go back and watch those um I'm
34:21
I'm not I don't know the titles right now but um I can post a link on our Facebook page after the Serv so I'm not
34:28
going to go completely in depth with this but I'm going to share briefly what it means what I mean by the principle of
34:35
authority and so when we see Jesus confronting demons we see it's just him
34:41
confronting the demons when we see when we read about all the demons and and sicknesses leaving people and under
34:49
Peter's Shadow we see that it's specifically Peter's Shadow it's not
34:54
Paul and Peter and Matthew and James like standing together and all of their
35:00
shadows in one place it was specifically Peter same with Paul it was specifically
35:07
Paul those handkerchiefs that were brought to him that people were being freed and healed it does not say Peter
35:12
and Paul and Matthew and James they all lined up in one church service and they brought handkerchiefs and aprons to them
35:19
all when the disciples were sent out two by two it didn't mean that they were
35:25
issuing commands at demons together at one time go go but they would be ministering one at
35:33
a time so this is God's principle of of
35:40
casting out demons what makes demons go is when they see you have true Authority in Christ when they see that you know
35:47
your Authority which by the way that's the anointing carries Authority in it and
35:54
number three that you are EXE uting your Authority
35:59
properly and that's what I'm talking about right now the principle of authority executing your Authority
36:06
properly means casting out a demon in your domain
36:14
not someone else's not outside of your domain but in your
36:22
domain and just you in your domain commanding the demon to
36:27
go that's one of the big um parts of executing your Authority
36:36
properly so my domain as the pastor of this church Apostle pastor of this
36:43
church is here at this church is everyone watching online is when I go
36:50
and minister at an event so this is my domain my authority so when everyone
36:56
walks in here here it's the act and and Tunes in online it's the action of you
37:01
submitting your spiritual life to Christ it's the action of you saying I want
37:06
God's will to be done in my life so it's the action of saying any
37:12
demon any that the devil brought in my life of bondage it has to go when I come there
37:20
because God's will is being exe God's will is being done there the kingdom of
37:26
heaven comes there and so that means that sickness oppression demons that are
37:32
holding on they have to go because the authority of Christ is going to be executed there and so all of you who
37:40
come here this is my domain so if I start saying a command all demons here
37:46
have to go every demon here has to leave because you brought yourself here
37:53
because you submitted yourself to Christ here his authority it
38:00
here but but if if if you're like I don't feel like going to church today and you're just down the road sleeping
38:06
in your house and not tuning in online or anything and I say all demons
38:12
go that Authority can't touch you you see you have to submit yourself
38:20
so so those of you who submitted yourself to the authority of Christ by coming here this is now my domain
38:28
and in the time of Peter all were healed and all who were freed all were free who came under his
38:34
shadow that shows the power of the anointing that shows that there's not
38:40
need for one-on-one prayer amen it shows that what makes demons go
38:48
is when there's real anointing in a vessel real Authority and they simply have to
38:54
execute their Authority and all who were there all demons and sickness have to obey it just like when
39:02
the president of the United States says to All American citizens you must do
39:08
this now we all will immediately do it or we break the law and then there's
39:16
consequences you know but he does not have to
39:21
delegate however many people live in America millions of people to knock on
39:26
your door and repeat the same Command right same with a teacher who
39:33
has authority over her children him or her there there's if there's 15 students
39:40
there does not need to be 15 teachers there issuing the command 15
39:47
times everyone be quiet now everyone be quiet now everyone be quiet now everyone be quiet now everyone that's me and 15
39:54
different voices put your phones away put your phones
40:00
away put your phones away put your phones away put your phones away put your phones away but a lot of people don't realize
40:06
this and like a lot of people if they see a demon manifesting everyone here would say get out get out of her get out
40:12
of her get out of her get out of her you Dam leave her leave her like everyone's
40:18
chanting that and that's not smart it's not it's not the the the principle of
40:25
authority it and when we don't abide in God's
40:31
principles that's when demons can mess around and so that's a
40:37
key why demons leave here so easily and
40:43
with little effort it's the level of anointing but it's also that we walk in unity here not just
40:53
me we walk in unity to the principle of a
41:00
Authority demons can't can't mess around now and they must
41:06
obey amen hallelujah
41:12
so so I I I shared you with you my domain so if you are a pastor if you're a minister your church is your domain if
41:19
you go Minister some somewhere you that's your domain for that service that you're ministering in if you lead a
41:25
Bible study that's your domain if you only lead a Bible study for just one day
41:31
someone invited you to lead the Bible study that's your domain that day so the proper way to do it is you would be the
41:37
one casting out demons that day in the Bible study and and just
41:44
you not two three four of you just you just like what you see me do at church
41:49
that's how it should be done in Bible study in small groups this isn't just for church here
41:57
this is I'm showing you the principle of authority that makes demons
42:03
go and that makes God entrust you with more anointing and so the but the most common
42:09
way that Believers that you will be casting out demons is going to be in your everyday life in your workplace in
42:18
your home with your family um doing errands at the hair salon nail salon I
42:24
don't know you know in every Every Day Life when you're interacting with people and when you're shining your light of
42:31
Jesus that attracts people and makes them want to chat with you and open up
42:36
to you and then eventually hopefully they'll start wondering about your life
42:43
wondering about your peace and joy and that will lead to a conversation sometimes where they start sharing they
42:49
open up to you that they struggle with anxiety or addiction or depression and that becomes an
42:54
opportunity for you to share with with them about Jesus how the reason you have this joy peace and you no longer have
43:00
anxiety depression addiction is cuz Jesus set you free and Jesus can deliver
43:06
you too he could even deliver you right now would you would you like me to pray for
43:14
you would you like to be free by Jesus's power that will be how most Believers
43:22
that like how it will look like and this isn't going to happen every day
43:27
you know follow the leading of the Holy Spirit go when the time is right and ripe to go in this
43:34
way so so so so that is your domain now if you're together two
43:40
friends of you at 5f for example and you're out somewhere and you start
43:46
talking to the stranger uh someone you don't know and your friend from 5f is standing beside you and that person
43:52
opens up to you that's your domain your friend from 5f just stands
43:59
there and Praises God but they don't say yeah get out get
44:04
out they don't Echo your get out because that's operating outside of the principle of
44:10
authority amen
44:18
hallelujah and also I just want to mention too that um when I like when I
44:25
Minister here and when I when I command over
44:31
everyone God has done the work he wants to do today there could be more work that's
44:36
needed more layers that he's planed to do maybe on the live that week or that
44:42
next Sunday maybe but um we have to make sure that we're not operating outside of the
44:48
principle of authority all of you here and going into the old wineskin mindset
44:55
of thinking that it's one-on-one prayer that makes demons go rather than really
45:00
the authority of Christ executed in the principle of authority that makes them
45:05
go because that can be a temptation to go back in the old win skin someone could be someone after
45:11
church could say I need more prayer I need more prayer but God's already done it they're just not
45:17
believing or they're like the the the lepers who that were healed on their way they need to receive it and wait for God
45:25
to work and bring it to completion amen or or maybe God has done a work and
45:32
there is more layers to go but it's God's will for the layers to be done later maybe God will speak to them you
45:38
need to renounce this you need to throw away this item and and be prepare yourself and Sun next Sunday I'm
45:44
delivering you of this thing so we got to Humble ourselves and not go just
45:50
praying for people because they're demanding it because they're in an old win skin mindset
45:56
that they must have one-on-one prayer amen not everyone's spiritually
46:02
mature but that doesn't mean we should be manipulated to go back to the old wine
46:07
skin and disobey God so what do you do if that happens encourage them and say this anointing is
46:14
real like if this happens here this anointing is real and true I testify about it in my life God has moved in
46:21
your life today you now have to receive it you have to receive and believe it or
46:26
else the devil could steal it believe what you have received today encourage them
46:31
amen and and and and if they're still insisting so much or even maybe if it
46:37
appears they're still manifesting sometimes God's just still doing a work you can issue a command to the demon and
46:45
for them but not a new command so you can say those words that have been
46:51
declared that Apostle gather declared they must happen they must come to
46:58
completion amen so so in that way you're staying in line with the principle with
47:03
the order that's the order of church that I shared about a few couple weeks ago you're staying in line with the
47:08
order with a principle of authority and you're not stepping outside
47:14
amen praise God the second
47:23
principle is the pr principle of the principle of territory so the
47:30
first principle is a principle of authority and the second principle is a
47:37
principle of territory so I just shared that I already shared that but I just
47:43
want you to know there's a principle of authority so I must be making sure that
47:48
I'm operating in authority and not the old wineskin way where several of us are
47:53
shouting at demons but in line with the authority and then number two that you're
48:00
operating in your territory your correct domain amen so even to pray after church
48:07
for someone here would be operating outside not in your
48:13
territory amen but then in your workplace tomorrow or in your life or in
48:20
your family or friends or and and someone comes to you hungry for Freedom
48:26
wanting you to pray for them that is your territory see if and at the same time
48:33
you need to make sure you're not just too zealous to cast out demons that you're you're just stepping outside of
48:41
territories you're you're this is the this is now the third um principle I want to share that you have to operate
48:47
in principle of Free Will God's principle God has principle
48:54
of authority of ter territory domains and free
48:59
will if you all come to church here you were saying in your own free will you you receive
49:06
prayer you know that that's what it says in the spiritual realm so if I say come
49:11
to the stage God's leading me to pray for you you that's that's operating in one's
49:18
free will but I still me I still must be sensitive because even though you've
49:24
given the action of free will God is so gentle so I so so so so gentle that
49:32
maybe you know all of a sudden you're not ready yet maybe you're
49:38
timid and I say come San you say no
49:43
okay I'm not going to say you demon get out of her or
49:50
him now there's a difference there's a difference when someone is completely
49:55
completely oppressed and I've seen this when I Minister I see the difference there's someone who is who I
50:00
can discern with spiritual eyes not everyone can but I can like it takes
50:05
discernment and I can see that that it's a demon oppressing them completely and they're looking at me it's usually like
50:11
a demonic look like supernaturally like Angry
50:17
like you know and sometimes it can be more like you know you have to have
50:24
discernment and so I can see oh the demon has taken over this person and it's the demon now saying
50:31
no and so that's when when the person has given me free will God and Me free
50:38
Will by them coming here so much so that the demon is taken over and now it's time for me to address that
50:44
demon amen but then some people they could have a demon but the demon is not
50:51
completely taking over so they're there consciously
50:57
so they they they they're there consciously and sometimes even a person can be
51:03
manifesting shaking maybe and I say come God wants to free you and maybe they're
51:08
just like and I can tell they're even though they're manifesting they're
51:13
consciously there the demon hasn't taken over completely so I can tell even though they're
51:20
manifesting that their Free Will says no they're not ready yet maybe their
51:25
faith isn't high enough yet so it's too bad but I can't go against their free
51:30
will God doesn't want me to go against their Free Will so I'll say okay and I believe and
51:38
I hope that they open up to God more and that they can still receive maybe through Mass Deliverance time and if not
51:45
that's okay I believe a seed is planted and that's what I share with I mean even
51:50
you know if parents bring a a child or a family member who is kind of look War
51:56
doesn't really want to come but you know they need freedom but sometimes demons don't go
52:02
until a person surrendered it's not just bringing to where bringing them to where the
52:07
anointing is but you should always have hope and know that seeds have been
52:15
planted that that something has been done in this spiritual realm that will lead them in their timing to surrender
52:23
to desire Jesus and to desire Freedom
52:29
amen hallelujah so you you you have to
52:34
operate in the principle of Free Will and so this means that when you see homeless on the
52:40
street even though they don't seem with it in the head some in the mind sometimes some of them this doesn't mean
52:46
that you should go you demon leave this person right
52:54
now Free Will so I mean the proper way if you
52:59
feel called to that the proper way is to love on them to love on them and to tell them
53:06
about Jesus and to share your testimony if they're if they have free will that
53:11
they want to listen to you and the conversation goes that way and share with them invite them to
53:20
come to church you know and then maybe depending on the person maybe the conversation
53:25
will go yes you can pray for me but you also have to know
53:30
that probably they have a higher level demonic torment by seeing the situation they are
53:39
in physically mentally spiritually so know that the importance of inviting
53:44
them to church of maybe even sharing video with them and God moving through the screen
53:51
as you're with them as you're spending time with them this is for those those of you who have feel that calling by God
53:58
to go minister to to people like this like people who were homeless for example but it's important you operate
54:05
in God's principles this principle of Free Will and if you operate outside of any
54:11
of these principles it can be dangerous to you
54:17
spiritually
54:23
amen hallelujah and so there's one more Point number
54:32
three um the third step when casting out demons and I'm going to be sharing that
54:39
next week yeah it's it we would be here for
54:45
about one more hour we can't give you too much meat you
54:50
got to digest this amen have you received praise
54:59
God praise God praise God hallelujah
55:05
hallelujah yes so this is the spiritual way part of I will continue more next
55:10
week but this is the spiritual way to cast out demons this is the way to stay
55:17
safe and protected this is the way that demons will actually obey
55:22
you and this is the way you will be aect active in the Kingdom so people can truly be
55:29
free amen hallelujah
55:35
hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you
55:41
Lord I want to declare over every one of you
55:46
now I declare that this new wine word would
55:55
remain in you that your spiritual eyes would open up more that's an Aha and
56:04
your spirits would come even more after today that even as you listen to this
56:09
message again God would open up your eyes more Revelation would
56:15
increase and I and I see in the spiritual realm that from
56:20
today things will be different in your life in terms of of how God will use you
56:27
because of this equipping and because you've humbly received it God is going
56:33
to be opening up doors and bringing more opportunities for people who are
56:40
oppressed to be set free as you encounter them whether it's you praying
56:46
for them and casting the demon out or whether it's you leading them to the high level place of
56:53
anointing where God God will deliver them because of your
56:59
obedience I speak people to be drawn towards you like never
57:06
before that they would be drawn to the light of Jesus in you so that God can then move through you and touch them
57:14
that in your workplace I speak there to be a light upon
57:20
you that for some reason people don't know why they feel like they just want to talk to you they feel like they just
57:27
want to open up to you they can't understand why but they are just drawn
57:33
and that they would move away from these clicks and friend groups of worldly people that's bringing harm to them and
57:40
they would be drawn to the light of Jesus in you and they would find Salvation freedom and healing through
57:47
you in jesus' name and I speak that this anointing would move through you I as
57:55
you minister to people that people would be freed in jesus' name that demons would
58:01
obey that they would recognize you as they recognize Jesus and Paul that they
58:08
would know your name and see the anointing and Authority you carry and
58:14
know they must obey in jesus' name
58:19
amen
