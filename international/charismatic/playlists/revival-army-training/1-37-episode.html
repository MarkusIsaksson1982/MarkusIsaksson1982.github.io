0:01
thank you Jesus wow I am so expectant for what
0:07
God's going to do today I um shared a word of God a
0:12
prophetic word of God in the beginning but only like a third of you were all we're here so I'm going to share again
0:19
for all of you who have arrived today is going to be a day like we have not seen
0:25
before today we have entered a new level of this revival and of God's anointing
0:31
holy spirit is going to move in a new way today I shared a message about two
0:37
weeks ago called um Flex being flexible with the Holy Spirit in that message I
0:42
shared how we have to be flexible with the holy spirit because God is the great I am who I am I am I am meaning like he
0:50
can do whatever he wants he's I am We cannot put him in a box we cannot think
0:55
he only's going to move this way no our God is a God who takes us glory to glory our God is a God who says you will do
1:02
things I did you'll do greater things meaning different things new things you haven't seen before and then there is
1:07
this shift where holy spirit's like I'm going to move in a new way now completely new completely different and
1:12
it was a new glory and it was a time of Deliverance where demons are being cast
1:18
out one after the other one after the other one after the other and so we need
1:23
to expect God to keep changing things up and doing new things and moving a new
1:30
race we've we've got to see the dead raised right we got to see the dead
1:35
raised yeah we're going to see the we're going to see God move in a greater we're going to see it like like Apostle Peter
1:41
where there's not even a word declared just the the Shadow and that's it demons out everywhere because God's increasing
1:49
his anointing he's increasing the level of
1:54
authority so today you need to take out your you're thinking of God only
2:01
moves this way like all the teaching you received even the teaching youve received here let God expand from
2:09
there do you understand like whenever you receive teaching it's not for you to
2:15
be putting God in the box of that teaching does that make sense it's a place where God builds upon builds upon
2:22
builds upon builds upon Hallelujah so be expectant for God to do
2:29
a new thing to move in a new way today and today is your day of
2:34
breakthrough it's your day of breakthrough there's some of you have been who have been needing breakthrough
2:41
for a long time there's some of you who have been praying for breakthrough for a long time there's some of you who've been praying to be completely free for a
2:48
long time you've been seeking Deliverance for a long time you've been praying Lord when will I be completely
2:54
free today is the day
2:59
if you can believe take all limits off of God
3:05
today do it it will be the best decision of your life that's full surrender full
3:11
surrender today amen
3:17
hallelujah now there is something that God is releasing today God is releasing
3:24
a revolution to a revelation today the Bible says my people perish because of
3:29
lack of knowledge my people perish because of the lack of knowledge of how the devil works of the devil's schemes
3:37
of his specific schemes of how he lies of all the intricate ways that he lies
3:43
my people perish but the Bible says my people shall know the truth when they know the
3:50
truth they shall be free this is why we need the Holy Spirit
3:56
we need the real five-fold church with anointed teachings that really open up
4:02
spiritual eyes that when we need anointed words RMA words of God Rama
4:07
meaning a present tense word of God today for God to speak to you and speak this is how the devil's been lying to
4:14
you now be free from that
4:21
deception it's not just about casting out demons you need to know the truth you need to be able to have victory over
4:27
the devil you need to be smarter and wiser than
4:33
the devil and that means we got to take it seriously uh being equipped and
4:38
growing and being nurtured in God's anointing and in his church because the Devil he's been
4:46
around for a long time and he's a spirit he knows the spiritual realm and most Christians don't know the spiritual
4:52
realm they're carnal so we got to take it seriously to get on the level of the
4:57
devil in terms of spiritually being able to see in terms of knowing his strategies his
5:04
schemes so he can't ever fool us amen hallelujah would you guys mind like
5:11
Shane and Austin and Leo could you just come over over here yeah and you guys are okay too but
5:18
I just want to feel like if there's space where there's shade I want I want to be able to to release to all of you but you can say there if you want but
5:24
just if there's space and there's a meaning why I speak this today
5:32
because in my eyes devil needs to see and get out as I
5:40
speak you know there's a piercing truth that
5:45
everyone needs to listen and hear today that's going to set you free
5:51
today I'm telling you there's a big deception of the devil coming off you
5:57
today Hallelujah okay this word is
6:02
today is is called no longer slaves today you will no longer be a
6:09
slave to the devil you will no longer be a slave to the devil's lies and
6:16
deceptions this word today is is a specific word to reveal specific
6:22
strategies of the devil for people who have been delivered if you've received Deliverance
6:29
today and if you need Deliverance this word is very very important for you to listen up to here and repeat this word
6:37
after we have the recording take notes after amen
6:43
so you think the devil's happy when he loses and the years of
6:51
bondage he's he's kept you in captivity of is gone you think he's happy he is
6:59
not happy one bit he wants revenge that's why it says when one demon goes
7:04
he's he really wants to come back and he wants to bring others back the Devil Wants Revenge the devil does not just sit idly by once one is
7:12
delivered uh-uh now the de the devil is the father
7:17
of Lies this is what it says in the Bible the father of Lies meaning he is the
7:25
greatest artist master of Lies the greatest it is decept decep one and the
7:33
way the Devil Comes the way that spiritual warfare takes place as it says we are in a spiritual war not a war of
7:38
flesh and blood but a spiritual war every day we are every day the way the
7:45
war happens the way the war takes place is by the devil lying to trying to lie
7:51
to you where do lies uh where do Lies come
7:57
from I mean where do lies enter the mind you
8:03
hear and it you believe it in your
8:10
mind so when a person is delivered this is this right here I'm going to speak
8:16
right now is one of the biggest strategies of the devil to keep you from
8:23
walking in Freedom and Abundant Life for God to get the glory and for you to walk in the purpose that God
8:29
created for you and enjoy Abundant Life With Jesus this is one of the biggest
8:36
schemes that when you have been delivered when you have been set free
8:42
you leave that place maybe the next day maybe two days later maybe a week later
8:47
maybe a month later the devil creeps back with lies not back inside of you
8:55
the demons are out but we are all in a spiritual War every single one of us
9:02
those who have been already freed and those who are not free yet we are all in that war and we will all have to have
9:08
victory over the devil's lies we will all face that battle of Lies every day
9:14
so the Devil comes with a strategic specific lie when you've already been
9:20
delivered saying this lie you're not fully delivered you need
9:28
Deliverance still you are still in bondage now for many
9:34
people Deliverance is a process for many people Deliverance happens in layers and
9:41
the biggest reason that people find Deliverance not being completely immediate but happening layer by layer
9:46
is usually when a person has really opened up doors specifically to
9:52
Witchcraft and specifically to demonic powers
9:59
that is usually when there needs to be layers and layers and
10:05
layers but the debt but this is where we need to know how tricky the devil is
10:11
okay because some of you see people who are getting layers of Deliverance and the devil can use that he can say
10:20
see you still need Deliverance just like other people who are still in the process of of receiving Deliverance you
10:26
still need more Deliverance the devil is speaking this to some of you but the truth is is that you have been freed you
10:34
have been delivered already there are no more Demons Inside of you but you are still in a war the
10:41
war never ends it gets easier and I will tell you I will tell you the truth the
10:47
war has gotten to be simple for me it's not like oh I'm in a war every day all these lies as you
10:55
seek God more and more as you surrender more and more you be come transformed into His Image in your mind so you are
11:02
quick to pick up the lies of the devil and you are quick to reject them and the Bible says submit to God resist the
11:07
devil and he will flee from you he will flee from you he will flee from you resist the devil and he will do you hear
11:14
that resist the devil and he will it's a principle he must when you still need
11:19
freedom and you have not maybe come to where the anointing is to destroy the Yoke that might not be the case you're
11:25
rejecting the devil you're trying but the Yoke's still there because the anointing is what destroys the Yoke the
11:30
Bible says but when you are free you resist the devil and he has to flee
11:37
you you reject his lies and he has to flee
11:42
you and I'm telling you this I've been amazed to see there's nothing greater than Walking with God there's nothing
11:50
greater the peace and joy is real and it's like I've noticed how the devil
11:56
cannot even lie to me anymore you know like how we are in the
12:02
spiritual realm is like we are giant Warriors right and the devil is so tiny
12:08
and we have the sword of the spirit massive imagine like that compared to the ant-sized devil it's a joke you know
12:16
like that's who we are but many times we don't have that Revelation and so we see ourselves as as smaller than the ant
12:23
siiz devil and we see the devil as huge because we believe his lies because he says to us I'm big and mighty more
12:29
powerful than you and I will keep you in bondage and we we believe the lies you are an ansz devil you have no power
12:35
that's what he speaks to us we believe it but the truth is that we are the ones so much bigger and more powerful through
12:41
Christ than him and he's under our feet and so what happens as you grow in the Lord and as you keep seeking him and
12:47
keep surrendering to him um you be transformed into his image and with that comes spiritual eyesight with that comes
12:54
discernment with that comes being so quick to to see the devil trying to lie and it just becomes
13:00
laughable before when you'd hear the devil's lie you'd like believe it and then maybe a week later after a friend
13:07
gave you spiritual advice or you listen to a sermon you were like oh I've been believing the lie but you've already
13:13
gotten into just depression and stuff you know and so that that's been your life before like oh heavy hard battle
13:21
Lies come all these lies oh yeah that's a lie okay I reject it but it can it's like maybe it feels
13:29
like that at first but I'm telling you as you keep seeking God and be transformed into His Image you see who
13:35
you are in Christ and the the devil like stops
13:44
lying I mean that's what I found it's like he he knows he's like wasting his
13:50
time I mean he can lie to me in different ways like um you know send
13:55
people to speak bad things about me but I'm like it's
14:00
laughable you know where where maybe if I wasn't strong enough I would be like take it to heart and be
14:07
like is this true what they said and then that would be a heavy battle but when you really are in the
14:13
truth when you've been transformed more in your mind to be like Jesus those Li lies like that come these new ways the
14:20
devil will try to come to me because he knows he can't come in other ways he you know I've rejected him so many times in
14:26
other ways he doesn't come in those ways anymore so he can try to come in new ways in these in the new level that I am
14:31
like speaking um mean things about me through people for example like on social media stuff like that or like um
14:38
Judas has come these are the ways I see him come and lie the battle these days Judas has come Judas is betray that can
14:44
be hurtful and stuff but God's got gotten me to be strong and and so they're all laughable
14:52
they're all like whatever who cares I have the victory through Jesus
14:58
you know devil can lie through people but it's not even you see that's how it becomes
15:07
that's how it be oh it's so sweet to give your life to Jesus it is so sweet amen it's fun to serve God it's not so
15:15
heavy I know it feels like this at first this is what I'm trying to teach you today that like when you're first
15:20
delivered Devil's not happy and Devil's trying hard to lie so hard to lie so at
15:27
first there's a there's a progression there's a there's a progression of of of of walking in that massive Warrior and
15:35
seeing yourself for who you are and the devil is under your foot completely there's a process for living in that
15:40
truth there's a process for the devil to see he can't mess with you because you know his lies there's a process so I'm
15:47
teaching you this process for some of you this is the beginning of the process when you are delivered many of you devil
15:53
will come in these with these loud voices saying you're not delivered you need more Deliverance
15:59
he can even come in the angel of light in this way yes go and get more
16:04
Deliverance instead like he can speak in that way the war is in your
16:12
mind and um it it says in the Bible that it says
16:18
in the Bible Romans 10:17 that faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of
16:25
God faith faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God the Bible
16:31
says hearing twice you can hear and you can listen I
16:37
hear music over there I hear um the motorcycles right over
16:44
there but I'm not listening to
16:53
them so the second one is listening some of you can come here
16:59
and you don't feel like listening maybe somebody dragged you here so you're hearing you know you're
17:06
hearing you hear this voice coming out of the this lady preaching out with out of the
17:11
microphone but you're not listening you're hearing but you're not listening maybe you're hearing my word
17:18
but you're listening to the music in the motorcycles faith comes by hearing and
17:25
hearing the word of God faith comes by hearing and actively choosing to listen to the word of
17:34
God so the opposite is true like so Faith this is talking about
17:41
faith faith with um listen hearing the word of
17:48
God can I have is everything okay with the sound turn up a little bit okay okay
17:56
great thank you Jesus I I just want to make sure nobody misses a word that's spoken today I'm like very Like a
18:04
Shepherd today I am a Shepherd but it's the shepherd's eye like I'm like my sheep
18:09
cannot miss a word of this message because I know that this is the key for your breakthrough I'm not
18:14
letting the devil wi with his lies Hallelujah so faith comes by
18:21
hearing hearing the word of God so Faith this is talking about faith in Jesus comes by hearing and hearing the word of
18:27
God I love that it's louder yeah yes yes [Applause]
18:34
Hallelujah but also anything you put faith in you can put your faith in other things that you're listening to you're
18:41
listening to other voices and that you can start to believe those voices and that can be real faith in those voices
18:49
that are not God in the lies of the devil it can be real faith not faith in
18:55
the truth but faith in the lies this is what the devil wants he wants you to
19:00
hear and hear hear and listen listen to
19:06
his lies so it becomes your truth the Bible says as a man thinks so he is as a
19:13
this is the Bible That's powerful statement as a man or woman thinks whatever they think that's what they
19:19
will be that will be their literal reality that's powerful that means that what you are thinking what you're
19:26
believing is very important you can believe what God has said about you you can believe the truth or you can believe
19:32
the devil's lies and you can become what the devil's lying to you that's Proverbs 23:7 for as he
19:40
thinks in his heart so is he for as he thinks in his heart so is
19:47
he so you need to understand
19:52
this the devil when he's lying in your mind this is what he tries to do to every person just because he's speaking
19:59
lies and you're believing the lies that does not mean you automatically get a demon for as a man thinks so he is it
20:07
doesn't mean that if you are believing the lies you become possessed it it does not mean that there are many of you who
20:13
are complet who are completely free but you are in a bondage in your mind not yolks not Demons
20:20
Inside but you are just believing lies you're just living believing lies every
20:25
day but you don't have demons
20:32
for you are no longer a
20:38
slave the Bible says you are no longer a slave you're no longer a slave to fear
20:43
you're no longer a slave to the devil you're no longer a slave to his lies you are free
20:50
now Hallelujah so um come up with this I have this example for you all right here
21:04
so this tree can represent right here under this tree can represent the bondage and that tree by
21:11
that tree can represent the freedom and I'm going to probably have you guys come back later to do the other
21:16
example okay so before you do this before Shane right now he's this is
21:21
Shane and he is going to represent someone who has demons someone who needs
21:27
Deliverance and you can put and Leo right here he is going to represent lies of the
21:34
devil the devil lying so right now he put the chains
21:42
on at this point this is not a lie he's just okay so this the chains around him
21:50
right now you can you can
21:56
come the chains are around him right now are representing that he has demons and he
22:04
needs Deliverance this is what this represents okay now he comes he has come
22:11
here to five-fold church let's say we're gonna say he's come to five-fold church where by the grace of God the anointing
22:18
is here to destroy every yoke
22:24
Hallelujah without Strife or struggle but with ease the anointing is powerful
22:30
and it destroys the yolks and so he's come what he's done is he's come with the keys to be free he's come he's he's
22:37
surrendered his life to Jesus he's come and he's come with faith believing that Jesus wants to free him and that he will
22:43
free him as he positions himself where the anointing is that's it he's come and he's made a decision he doesn't want
22:48
these things in his life that he had before he's renounced he's renounced his old life he's renounced the lies of the
22:54
Devil he's renounced the bondage and now he's ready to be free so we comes here
23:00
and the anointing of God touches him so for example I command the demons to go I
23:06
command every demon in him to leave now in the name of
23:13
Jesus [Music]
23:21
hallu lies you still need a Deliverance they're lies they're lies you still need
23:27
a Deliverance they're lies lies you still need a Deliverance you still need a Deliverance
23:34
they lies lies you still need a Deliverance they're lies you still need
23:40
a Deliverance it's a lie you still need a Deliverance you're still in bondage
23:47
you're still in bondage it's a lie it's a lie it's a lie you're still in bondage
23:54
you still need a Deliverance it's a lie it's a lie it's a
23:59
lie you need a Deliverance you're still in
24:05
[Music]
24:10
bondage what happened he was free I didn't see any
24:18
chains go back around him remember the chains represents literal Demons Inside of him okay there was not a chain that
24:26
went around him at any point but the devil came with his
24:32
strategy to lie loudly in his ear and say you still need Deliverance you still
24:38
have demons you're still in bondage lied and lied spoke it again and
24:44
again and again the devil pointed out other things in his life where it's actually just areas in his life that he
24:51
needs to be transformed more into the image of God just areas in his life that he's still growing in just lies to the
24:58
devil but not actual demons the devil pointed them out and says that's a demon that's a demon that's a demon still you need freedom
25:03
from and he believed the devil's loud lies strategic loud
25:09
lies he believed Faith came his faith that he as
25:14
demons came by him hearing and hearing by listening to the devil that became his reality now look at this so this
25:22
spot where he is in this represents his place of bondage where he was in bondage before just like the the Israelites were
25:29
in Egypt that was their place of bondage God had freed them they wanted to go
25:35
back devil had tricked them go back in the mind so that represents his
25:44
place of Freedom he was walking he this was he was the moment he stood up the moment that the chains were off and he
25:50
stood up he was free and this walk right here to that tree represents the Walk of Abundant Life day by day glory to glory
25:56
to glory to glory to glory till you reach the promise land and then from there you're just flying flying flying in the promised land with Jesus glory to
26:02
glory but he turned back and he literally went back to the place where he was in bondage notice there is no
26:08
chain around him still a chain is not around him still
26:15
just because he just because he believed those lies he didn't get a
26:21
demon not not not always do demons come back simply by your you you believing a
26:26
lie this is part of the Christian walk constantly we are learning oh that's a
26:33
lie so put your hands back together but did you notice that his even his hands
26:38
went back his hands went back like this he kneeled back down in his place of
26:47
bondage but no one put his hands like this no one put CH he thinks right now
26:52
that these chains are around his wrists this is his reality this is what he thinks because this is is what the
26:58
devil has been lying to him he did not know this deception this lie of the devil that I'm teaching you
27:07
today and so the devil still has no power over him but he's allowing the Devil to have
27:14
power over him he's allowing the Devil to make him think he needs Deliverance still make
27:20
him think he has demons when he's free he can get up and walk right now he can
27:26
get up and rejoice and walk arms like this he can do that right now
27:31
there's no demon no bondage holding him from doing that right now that's the truth of the
27:37
situation but this is the scheme of the devil the devil's scheme is to lie to get you to believe his lies that's his
27:43
only
27:51
trick so what are we to do then how do we overcome this you can say there
27:58
how does he overcome this the Bible
28:04
says James 4:7 submit yourselves then to
28:11
God resist the devil and he will flee from you submit yourselves un to God resist
28:19
the devil and he will flee from you remember this is a principle resist the
28:25
devil resist his lies and he he must flee from
28:30
you 2 Corinthians 103 3-5 for we live for for we live in the world we for we
28:36
do not wage as the world does the weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world on the contrary they have divine power to
28:44
demolish strongholds to demolish arguments to not just to to demolish
28:51
arguments meaning lies outward lies outward lies of the devil arguments not
28:58
Demons Inside arguments we can demolish these arguments these lies and every
29:03
pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God and we take captive
29:08
every thought to make it obedient to
29:18
Christ there's some of you you need to you need to go back to when God delivered you maybe it was the first
29:24
time or maybe you needed like three or four layers of Deliverance and and and
29:29
maybe the fourth time you knew deep in your heart you were completely free you need to go back to that day
29:37
because the devil's lied to you after that day you were free that
29:42
day but a day pass or a week passed and the devil came with this strategy to
29:48
scream very loud in your ear you're not fully free yet and you came to believe
29:55
this that this was true um there's something also I want to
30:03
mention if you're not comfortable Shane you can like sit you're good
30:09
okay I care about you I want to make sure you're okay you're having your knees hurt um so there's something also
30:17
I want to share with how much the devil can lie as a man thinks so he is can we
30:22
can we take a moment to realize how powerful that is that's the word of God as a man thinks so he is meaning the
30:30
devil can control you in your mind so much not Demons Inside but if you believe the lies the devil can control
30:36
you to do anything if you believe the
30:42
lies um he now think about if you're to go out there on the street you're
30:48
meeting people in public or in the restaurant or something and just say someone that has I don't know a unique
30:53
personality Charisma he just comes up to you and the person just comes up to and they're like hey raise your hand if
31:00
raise your hand right now hey give me a big high five hey clap your hands like maybe they come really
31:07
enthusiastic and they say that to you probably most of us here would like do it like
31:13
okay right like our first thought is just okay you know not many of us would think
31:21
wait like who is this person um is this person trying to manipulate me this is
31:27
weird um I want I want to like I I don't want to just like obey anybody most of us wouldn't think that
31:34
right most of like [Music] okay well I say that to mean what I say
31:42
when I say that I mean to say that the devil can do the
31:48
same the devil can speak anything he wants to you in your mind and if you don't have this truth that I'm sharing
31:55
with you today if you don't have this discernment you can be thinking it's God or just the
32:03
truth just the truth and you don't realize it's actually the devil
32:10
lying so there can even be what looks like demonic
32:17
manifestations that are not really
32:22
demons not acting sure there may be some people with strange hearts out there who
32:30
need the love of God and maybe there's actors out there in the world manifesting demons or something but there are some people where there's what
32:38
looks to be demonic manifestations that aren't demons but because a person has been so
32:46
used to being in that position
32:51
Shane and then if the manifestation is saying um screaming for example so used
32:57
to that manifestation ah so used to that that became so familiar and that that
33:03
the demons can literally speak to a person loudly again and again scream
33:09
scream scream that the person doesn't even realize it's lies but but really believes it's it's
33:16
involuntary it's demons making them to scream
33:28
I'm just making sure no one misses a word today is all amen hallelujah if I
33:34
pause sometimes it's like I God has spoken to me this very clearly no one can miss a word of this because this is
33:40
going to set you free this truth amen hallelujah so please nobody
33:45
have any kind of distractions please so we want to make sure everybody can receive the word
33:51
amen so um the the demon the de the devil can
33:58
speak these lies so strongly and if there's certain it's kind of like um if you had a have a limp
34:05
if you walk with a limp and I I I feel like I I think I've
34:11
had a limp before I mean I know I had a limp before I just I played no because this is just coming to me right now that's why I'm saying like this I was
34:18
just reminded right now I had lymphs before like in um like soccer playing soccer growing up where I twisted my
34:24
ankle and stuff and I'm thinking right now how like sometimes I you would get so used to it that you forget to check
34:31
like am I am I healed yet you know what I mean cuz cuz our really hurts when you
34:37
put your full weight on it so you just limp out of habit yeah have anybody of you
34:43
experience that where one time you're like oh wait oh wait it doesn't
34:48
hurt I'm Healed you know so it's like that that's what it's like in terms of
34:56
thinking you need Freedom still and also in terms of manifestations if you're so used to the
35:02
certain manifestation or something the devil can speak that so loudly and it can your mind can be so powerful to
35:09
believe that to overtake your body not a demon not a demon doing it inside
35:16
because when a demon's inside a person can't control the demon Is possessing the body
35:23
but it's as a man or woman thinks so is he or she as a man or woman thinks
35:29
demons are manifesting they will begin to look like they're
35:34
[Music] manifesting you got
35:39
it thank you Lord
35:45
so Proverbs 18:21 says the death and life are in the power of the
35:51
tongue how do we have victory over the devil's lies so that they are not so
35:56
loud that we we just want to give in and we do give in how do we have Victory
36:02
simple submit to God submit to his truth submit to this Rama word of Truth you've
36:08
he you're hearing today submit to
36:13
it submit to the truth that the devil's a liar I'm not going to let him lie to me that's the word of God I'm submitting
36:20
to the truth of God submit to the truth that you have victory over the devil through
36:26
Christ as I said some of you need to go back to that day when you knew you were completely
36:32
free because some of you have forgotten or the devil's the devil has told you oh you thought you were free but you
36:38
weren't really you need to go back to that day just like the Israelites needed
36:43
to go back to the day where they were freed and so overjoyed and saying God is good he is faithful he has freed me
36:50
instead of being in the wilderness completely forgetting everything and not even saying God freed me thank you Lord
36:57
not even saying that anymore but so convinced by the devil's lies that the bondage is where they should
37:07
go some of you need to remember that moment where you knew you were
37:13
free remind yourself of that and walk in that submit to God
37:21
submit to his truth submit to the moment he freed that moment he freed you that was truth you thank God thank you Lord
37:28
for freeing me go back to that place of Truth submit to God submit to his truth
37:33
resist the devil resist his lies and how do we resist his lies well we get the word of God in us
37:42
you come to church you hear this word of God the remma word too you get that word of God in you so that so that when the
37:49
lies come you bring that word to the Forefront of your mind you meditate on it now wait a minute what is the truth
37:56
here this is what God says this is what God has said I recognize this is a lie
38:02
of the devil you're already beginning to resist in your mind when you do that and then the final action important action
38:09
of resisting the devil is speaking rejecting by your words as it
38:15
says the power of life and death are in your tongue this is where the devil loses is when you use your tongue this
38:22
is where he loses I'm telling you this is where all the the lies have
38:28
to go away and he has no power it's when you keep quiet that he
38:33
wins so what you need to do is when the devil begins to tell you you're not
38:39
fully free you still need Deliverance you still have Demons Inside of you and it's going to be a long time till you're
38:44
free you need to tell him to shut up he's a liar I reject every lie of the devil I
38:53
am free I am free I am
38:58
delivered Jesus has Set Me Free it says in the Bible by his stripes
39:04
you are healed you are free declare it you can
39:11
declare it even when you're in the process of of needing Freedom you're you're getting layers and maybe you
39:17
still do have demons you need layers Still Still declare I am free because it
39:22
says by his stripes I am healed not you will be healed
39:28
you will be it says by his stripes you are healed meaning this is mine and as I
39:33
declare it as I submit to God as I surrender to God I will see it manifest
39:39
fully I am healed I am delivered so you should every one of you be declaring
39:44
these words over your life constantly I am free I am
39:50
healed but those of you especially whom the devil has been speaking to you so
39:56
much you're not free yet you're not completely free yet you're in bondage still you need to confess these words
40:05
thousands of times I am free I am delivered I am free Jesus has freed me
40:12
devil you're a liar Jesus has freed me Jesus I thank you for freeing me I thank
40:17
you Jesus for freeing me I praise you Jesus for freeing me I will testify I am free I will tell the world he has freed
40:25
me and when you do that you will see the
40:31
devil and his lies leave you one by one well it came before it was strong like
40:38
every day it's like oh man I still need Deliverance oh man when is this going to happen because you're hearing those lies all the time where now you start
40:45
confessing they start dwindling they start becoming less you keep confessing
40:50
thousands of times I am free they dwindle more this is the principle resist the devil and he must
40:57
flee they will leave the lies will like I spoke to you right now it's like the
41:03
battle is like easy because I've resisted the devil so many times he cannot come back he knows
41:10
he can't fool me amen it will be like that for you if
41:16
you can start confessing the truth I am free I am
41:21
free and you will start to notice there's certain areas in your some of you who are already free there's certain
41:27
areas in your life where you where it's like physical manifestations that you
41:33
believe are from demons but the P your mind is so powerful like when you
41:38
believe those lies it's like it's not just a limp but those other areas in your life physical areas where you feel
41:44
like it's literally like a demon's living there living in that part of your body or something you know um that will
41:52
disappear because it wasn't a demon you were freed but the devil has tricked you
41:58
so much that as a man thinks so he is the lies have become so powerful not a demon but so powerful that those
42:06
physical ailments that you thought were a demon they they they were they were like
42:11
they really felt real but as you start believing the truth and confessing they
42:17
will go away the physical ailments in your life that you thought were were caused by
42:22
demons the physical issues the physical problems keeping you from eating the phys physical
42:28
issues will fall away they will go away because the devil has no power when
42:35
you can speak the truth and live in the truth and resist him and reject him
42:40
amen hallelujah
42:45
hallelujah so um Leo so we're going
42:51
to we're going to do this example one more time but this time
42:57
Shane here has heard the truth he's heard the truth he received
43:04
this message just as you have today and the truth has set him
43:09
free so he's going to respond differently put the chains around he's going to respond differently this time
43:17
this is what you're going to do today some of you are already free and you didn't know it until right now this is
43:22
what you're going to do right now and you're going to see that you really are free you can do it again do the whole example
43:33
again they're lies you're still in bondage they're lies this is when he's
43:38
already in bondage by the way so he's in bondage right now he comes to where the anointing is he and the anointing
43:44
destroys the Yoke I command every demon to leave you now in the name of
43:50
Jesus hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
43:56

44:46
[Music] guys you see how he was so unbothered by the devil's lies I am free devil was the
44:53
war was still there but then he was losing his power he was behind him him just like the devil's under your feet he
44:59
continued he didn't go back to the he didn't go back to the place of bondage where the devil could be surrounding him
45:05
with the lies but he walked forward leaving the devil in the
45:12
dust and as you keep resisting him and keep walking forward this is where the devil doesn't even lie anymore he's like
45:20
can't catch up to you that's what I was sharing before what I've experienced in my life it's like he can't catch up he's completely defeated
45:27
the lies he lies to you you're so laughable he's in the
45:35
dust amen hallelujah
45:40

45:47
