I've been teaching a series on my my book that has just come out in August
0:05
the secrets of the anointing accessing the power of God to walk in
0:11
Miracles and um the past so I've been doing a series on this book the past few
0:16
Sundays go back on YouTube and watch them if you haven't seen them you can always find the sermons under the live
0:23
under at fful church YouTube and and also my YouTube Apostle Go cek YouTube I've been expanding upon the first few
0:30
chapters of the book things that going even Beyond what's in the book and
0:35
revealing secrets of how to access the anointing and what I've been teaching the past few weeks is the biggest part
0:41
of how to receive the anointing has to do with your heart has to do with the purity of your
0:50
heart to receive the anointing the the biggest secret is that God looks for a
0:57
trustworthy heart and then the anointing comes you don't have to worry about too
1:03
many things you don't have to worry about uh any kind of rituals or whatever
1:09
when you have a trustworthy pure heart God will find you like you found David in the fields and he will make sure that
1:17
anointing comes upon you as long as you continue to be pure in heart and listen to all the things that he brings you all
1:24
of the secrets and the Mysteries and the revelations and direction that he gives you that you don't know yet but the C to
1:30
receive the anointing amen and so today I'm going to be
1:36
teaching about the power of impartation
1:43
amen and so before I begin teaching I'm
1:48
going to invite Pastor Heather up to the
1:54
stage because she had she knows the power of impartation don't
2:00
you she has an amazing testimony of how she has seen impartation the reality of
2:08
impartation in her life so um if you could share this happened this began
2:13
started be started to begin to happen the impartation now more than a couple years ago now right all right you want
2:20
to share i' love to thank you praise God
2:27
hallelujah I was I was um Always In Love With Jesus since the time I got saved at
2:35
17 and I loved God I always wanted to do his will I loved his people I had a
2:41
heart for Revival but I had no idea what it was going to look like I spent decades serving God going to prayer
2:49
groups being a lifted up in youth groups and and teaching teaching children
2:54
teaching women leading worship going to Bible College teaching in Bible College
3:00
my husband and I started our own church in 2012 however I saw people needing
3:09
freedom and I did not know how to get that to them it wasn't through more book
3:15
reading it wasn't through more conferences to go to I had tried all of that my library was huge and then Co hit
3:24
and and there was many people had left physical church we kept ours open and we
3:30
we Pastor a church together a little over an hour away from here but people
3:35
would come in harassed by demons mentally ill um oppressed and and I
3:42
would pray but I wouldn't see any freedom and it was completely frustrating because I knew the Bible but
3:48
I didn't know the anointing and so as I was wanting so
3:54
much to know about God's power I was tagged in a post on Facebook book with
4:00
Apostle Katherine at the park in Los Angeles and I watched truly in awe and
4:15
wonder it was as if this was everything I had wanted but it was not the way I
4:22
had expected I had expected many other different ways but this was a woman
4:30
Apostle young
4:37
beautiful
4:42
bold but she was so full of grace she
4:47
was ministering healing and deliverance to people with no effort it it was
4:53
something I had never seen and I have studied all the old revivals all the way back and when I watched I was so drawn
5:02
it was like Moses being drawn to the burning bush and I watched of course I binged I
5:10
watched over and over and over I shared with everybody in our church which was
5:15
got down down to about 12 at that point and I told my husband I must get to Los
5:21
Angeles and so it was out in a park I showed up in May of
5:27
2021 and I watched and I was overcome by
5:32
what I was seeing it was Jesus and the acts church today which I had never seen
5:39
in 42 [Applause] years and I came for three weeks I
5:49
watched even one person in our women's group had manifested a demon and I had
5:57
wanted to cast it out before I had received received any impartation of anointing and it was 2 hours it was
6:03
laborious it was Breaking My Heart the demon wasn't coming out first time I'd
6:09
ever seen a demon manifest in front of me and finally she just received peace
6:14
and we went on and that was a Friday night and that next Sunday I start I
6:19
mean I kept coming to La every time after our church service for 3 weeks I said I must get to Los Angeles I must
6:26
get this impartation I didn't know I was going to have an actual hand laid on me
6:31
because I knew I could receive it out in the crowd or I could come but I brought
6:37
a woman with me who was very harassed by demons and I brought her up for
6:42
deliverance and she did receive some Deliverance she was a little resistant and so as she was there I was in front
6:50
now this is my third word week at 5f church I'm standing there with her and this the spirit of God said now is your
6:57
time and I just stepped up and that's really not like me it's just not but I stepped up I said I want to receive this
7:10
anointing and I didn't care what I looked like I didn't care that I was twice her age I didn't care what Bible
7:17
School she'd been toward if she'd been none of that mattered I saw the demonstration and the power of God
7:24
setting people free healing people changing lives and doing it in Grace
7:33
and a and Apostle Katherine so graciously just looked me as she does when you come up here she will look you
7:40
straight in the eye and you feel like you're the only one there it's so
7:47
anointed and and she prophesied over me as I yelled out to the crowd where are
7:54
all the pastors why aren't you here don't you want this like kind of bold
8:00
and she looked at me and she she released a word over me and said she saw
8:06
that God was going to use me because of my heart God was going to use me to
8:13
break down religion
8:19
whoa and she released the impartation of the anointing to me the power of God
8:25
came on me I fell back and I felt something come into me I can't tell you
8:31
chills there was no like I can't tell you physical because it was a spiritual
8:36
impartation but from that day the power of God was in me and I knew it and I got
8:42
put to the test three days later at our Bible study on Wednesday night at our church when the first time in a church
8:48
service a woman manifested a demon and I asked her as I was trained do would you
8:55
like to renounce and she renounced confusion and I saidwell in jesus' name I detach
9:03
you from that and I command that Spirit to leave you and all of a sudden the demon manifested out of her and then the
9:11
demon spoke back to me a demon spoke out of this woman I had known for eight years who had never spoken like this and
9:18
the demon said I own her and then I was realizing okay I'm really talking to a
9:24
demon now and whoa and and and I mean it was it was great to watch Apostle
9:30
Katherine but now I'm in those shoes and it flashed through my heart I
9:36
said Lord can I really do this he says yes you received the anointing I'm with
9:41
you you can do this we'll do this together and that was so fast in a Flash and immediately I spoke back to the
9:49
demon realizing God says I'm here I three days earlier I had received and I
9:54
better walk by faith and so I said you don't own anybody go
10:03
and she was set free right
10:11
there Hallelujah and that has never stopped
10:17
since that day in July of 2021 so what the anointing real quick
10:25
what the anointing is done in my life it has attached me to apostle Catherine I'm
10:30
not going anywhere when you know that you're
10:37
receiving the anointing you don't need the buffet and I learned that real quick
10:42
because this th this revival is being poured through her as an apostle so I don't need to figure out if anybody else
10:49
is doing Deliverance I can go check that out God just said stay attached so every
10:54
single Sunday except for like two days when I was out of the state I have come
11:00
for 28 months here to 5f wherever it's been in the park or
11:07
here but this was just the beginning I had to grow and the spirit of wisdom
11:13
that is upon Apostle Katherine was growing in me it was not boom and and it
11:18
just stayed bright I had to stay connected I learned the spirit of wisdom
11:23
the spirit of Revelation in the knowledge of Jesus the Mount of of honor
11:30
that I see she gives to God the worship she gives to God that began to come into
11:36
me I began to stand straighter I began to sense the power of God giving me the
11:43
same anointing that's coming it's little but it's growing and I'm learning it's also given
11:51
me peace beyond measure I was able to do Deliverance to my husband who' been
11:58
pastoring already for 10 years he received Deliverance he also CA yes he
12:05
also came and received an impartation from Apostle Katherine and the moment she laid hands on him he's big he felt
12:12
like a bolt of lightning hit him and now he cast out
12:20
demons it's transformed Our Lives it's transformed our church this revival is
12:27
going around the whole world world and it is going to expand you on the inside
12:33
and I am not the same person I was before I feel the power of God in Me
12:40
24/7 and I listen to the teachings I glean I listen to what she doesn't say I
12:47
listen to what she says I watched how she went through the persecution it's all up on social media and I watched I
12:54
was so proud of my spiritual mother she took it she she took it and she looked
13:00
straight up and look she's untarnished she's
13:08
untarnished she's beautiful so stay planted here don't go anywhere we've
13:14
just gotten started Revival is
13:20
now I love you hallelujah
13:26
hallelujah praise God praise God wow
13:33
Jesus hallelujah thank you Jesus
13:40
amen amen wow thank you so much Pastor Heather for sharing that's so powerful
13:46
it brings me such joy and awe of God every time I think about your testimony I remember that was one of the
13:53
first testimonies that I had heard of of because it was really early on one of the first testimonies of impartation
14:00
through me that I had heard of and it has brought such joy to my life ever since then to know how now every week at
14:09
your church people are being set free there's many of them here today right that have been set
14:15
free Hallelujah so many if not all have been
14:21
delivered now through this impartation through you praise God thank you Jesus
14:27
glory to God glory to God thank you Jesus it says in
14:33
Mark 16:17 these signs will accompany those who believe in my name they will drive
14:40
out demons they will speak in new tongues they will pick up snakes with their hands and when they drink deadly poison
14:47
it will not hurt them at all they will place their hands on seek people and they will get
14:52
well this is one of the huge messages in this revival God is highlighting this
14:58
scripture that so many people have skipped by all who believe and so I am here to say as an
15:06
anointed Apostle of God I am here to say this is not just for me this is not about I am the anointed
15:14
one come and receive healing and deliverance nope come receive
15:19
impartation so you can do what I'm doing too and that message has not been around
15:27
too much at least Le I haven't heard it much in the body of Christ there has anointing has been so
15:34
rare and when it has been visible I have not really heard myself many stories of
15:40
true impartation many uh present day Elijah
15:45
to Elisha stories but this is biblical and this is
15:51
how it should be impartation should be happening in
15:57
every Ministry the anointing should should be in every Ministry in every Church yes the power of God should be in every
16:03
church not just some Churches oh there's different visions and assignments and callings that is true but this is all of
16:10
our callings to carry God's power the church should be a place where people who are healed from sicknesses who have
16:18
demons they come and get free and who receive impartation of anointing so they can do these things they can do these
16:25
they can have these signs follow them cuz it says all who believe these signs
16:32
now we see this scripture and I think a lot of people just skip past it because they really don't see it today but it
16:37
says all who believe it doesn't say just the elite it says all who believe and by
16:42
the way it's not just enough to say I believe in Jesus the meaning of believe is a True
16:48
Believer which is the one that takes the narrow road not the wide one the one who
16:54
lives their life in surrender the one who is after God's heart that's that's how every believer
16:59
should be not every believer is that way but that's what a true believer's life should look like and this is what it's
17:05
referring to so all True Believers with pure hearts should be seeing these signs
17:10
in their life they should be casting out demons heing the sick it's going to look different for everybody we have
17:16
different callings it's not everyone's calling to be a five-fold minister it's not everyone's calling to be an Elijah
17:21
it's not everyone's calling to walk in the highest level of anointing to deal with principalities but it is everyone's
17:27
calling to carry Jesus in his fullness not missing his power and that when God
17:34
is leading you to in your own dominion if someone needs prayer if someone has a
17:40
demon that you would cast it out if someone is sick that you would pray and release healing to
17:46
them amen hallelujah we all have dominion over the devil we all have been we all
17:53
have been given authority over the devil over demons
17:59
we we've been given that Authority but now it's about how to access
18:06
it how to access that power of
18:12
God and so as I shared the the past few weeks in the early part of the book I'm
18:18
teaching on the the part one of how to receive the anointing and that's
18:25
speaking on how to develop a heart that God is looking for that he can trust The
18:30
Godly character that God's looking for what Purity really looks like what
18:36
humility really looks like because there's a lot of people that have false humility and no humility at all and they think they have
18:42
humility right so what real humility looks like what really being a heart
18:49
after God looks like those are the secrets that many people don't know that
18:54
I released in the book and that I've been teaching the past few weeks and then there's a part two of how to receive the anointing so first of all
19:01
God is it wants to see that he can trust your heart but then the anointing just
19:07
doesn't just all of a sudden just come in you
19:13
usually um in the Bible there are a few examples of the anointing coming into a
19:20
servant of God without another vessel imparting like with the burning bush of
19:27
Moses so Moses is an example Elijah is an example as
19:33
well but those are just a few exceptions to the main way that we see
19:41
God releasing his anointing in his servants when you look in the Bible and you really see if you want to see God's
19:48
main system of release and anointing it is through
19:54
impartation which impartation means God puts anointing in a vessel and that
19:59
vessel might have received it from another vessel like for me I received impartation of anointing from my
20:06
spiritual father Prophet Dr Jord Davi and so God puts that anointing in the vessel whether it came uh like the
20:13
Moses style directly from God or it came from impartation and then God then calls that
20:20
servant of God to be a leader of a Ministry a leader of a church to be the
20:28
head Jesus is the the the leader but the head meaning leader of the ministry amen
20:35
and God gives that leader a vision and assignment and he a specific vision and
20:41
assignment and then he gives that leader the head anointing specific anointing to
20:47
carry out that vision and assignment we are a body of Christ the
20:55
Bible talks many times how we need the whole body we were and God has Works
21:02
exploits for us to do in his kingdom to carry out his business and his major
21:09
works his major uh specific projects assignments that he that he has where
21:17
he's really taking down the devil's Kingdom and expanding his kingdom these are going to
21:23
happen um with not just one person but as a team as an
21:29
army as a body and so this this is God's
21:35
system of doing his major works on this Earth is through his
21:43
churches through his church and he he he he has specific visions and assignments
21:49
for different churches and the churches always have one leader and he specifically gives that
21:56
leader a specific vision an assignment to one person to the
22:01
leader and then he gives the specific anointing to carry out that
22:07
assignment and then he will call specific people specific children of his
22:13
to go and be a part of that same vision and assignment to come and be an army and
22:22
help that assignment and vision go forth because one person can't do it all an
22:29
army is needed and so God will speak to people he will he will speak in your
22:34
spirit he will he will speak to you he'll put put passion in your heart I want you here I want you here with this
22:43
vision and assignment at this ministry under this
22:48
leader that's that's God's system that's the church the church has
22:55
many churches and we are all one body but there are many churches but they're not they the real churches are not just
23:02
churches their own way they churches going by like a formula but they are anointed by God
23:11
they are there because God said I I'm anointing you leader and I am anointing
23:16
you for a specific calling a specific assignment and vision that I want done
23:21
this is what it is this is my vision not yours my vision and this here is the
23:28
anointing so you can fulfill this vision and assignment and now I will bring people to help
23:34
you so we all work together for the same vision assignment and purpose
23:42
amen hallelujah so for example at five-fold
23:49
church we are given this we've I have been given and we have been given this mandate this assignment and this vision
23:58
to bring Revival to the world to declare that Jesus is Alive to
24:07
be bold and unashamed of scriptures such as these to be bold and unashamed and
24:12
about the acts church and declare this is what Jesus did then and he wants to
24:18
do this now he is moving in power now the kingdom of God is not a matter of
24:23
talk but of power he has died for you so that you would have Abundant Life not only when
24:30
you die and go to heaven but here and now he has died for you to be healed of all sicknesses and free from
24:38
demons and the vision and the the vision and the assignment the Mandate is to teach these things but not only teach
24:45
these things but to demonstrate these things to release God's power to the oppressed to the
24:53
sick and to and to release impartation of the anointing in to to share this
25:00
that we have been given with the whole world to other
25:06
Ministries so that they may walk in the anointing as well and they may see the
25:12
power of God move in their churches and in their lives everyone's life not just pastors not just church leaders but that
25:19
everyone these signs would follow them we have the vision and assignment
25:26
and mandate to to unashamedly declare that God wants
25:33
there to be a five-fold Ministry with Apostles and Prophets and this is God's way of equipping his body and to accept
25:41
and embrace these offices the apostles and the prophets
25:47
amen so Hallelujah so that's part a summary of the vision and mandate here
25:54
and so God will speak to as he's spoken to many of you and many others out there and many watching online he will speak
25:59
to your spirit and say I want you to come here come and serve me here to
26:07
fulfill your purpose on this Earth it it it's it has to be connected to this it has to be connected to being planted
26:16
where God has called you to be that is where you will be equipped that is and
26:21
and listen to this your many people think my purpose is to be a singer my purpose is to be a teacher my purpose is
26:27
to be a lawyer or a doctor but they're missing the big picture your number one
26:32
purpose is to be part of this body of Christ and to really truly be a vessel of God and help fulfill God's vision and
26:46
assignment his specific assignment and vision that he's calling you to and so the most important thing in this world
26:51
is for souls to be saved and the sick to be healed and the press to be
26:59
free that's that's that's why you are here to help make that happen by God's
27:05
power him C- laboring with you that is your purpose but the that purpose is
27:12
always going to be connected to being planted in a specific Church where God
27:19
has a specific vision and assignment for you
27:25
amen and then God will will call you to do other things but many people don't realize the real
27:32
power of being planted and receiving there and how that's equipping you to do all that you were called to do on this
27:39
Earth and how that is where you're really truly being effective for the kingdom of
27:45
God it's not just about making people happy putting a
27:51
smile on their face it's about being a vessel of God's power and doing exactly
27:56
what he is calling you to do so people can really be saved healed
28:03
and delivered amen hallelujah so
28:11
uh many people they're missing out on receiving the anointing and walking
28:18
in the anointing because they are missing the revelation of
28:23
impartation many people want to just receive the anointing on their own and honestly majority of the time that's
28:30
not God's plan that's not God's will for most people to receive the anointing in that way as I explained in the Bible
28:36
there are some exceptions but the main way is through
28:42
impartation especially in this revival and we we see in the
28:50
word how in Psalms 133 ver uh chap chapter
28:59
one verse one how good and pleasant it is when
29:04
God's people live together in unity it is like Precious oil poured on the head
29:10
running down on the beard running down on Aaron's beard down on the collar of his
29:16
robe this is a prophetic picture of how the anointing flows to other people a
29:25
prophetic picture of of God's system of releasing anointing Aaron Aaron is the head of
29:32
this Min this certain ministry that's talked about here with a vision and assignment from God he has given
29:37
anointing from God and then God calls others to come underneath him to serve
29:43
underneath him to be part of that same vision and assignment and stay positioned there be planted
29:50
there and when the people just stay there the anointing oil the anointing
29:56
flows from the head where it is in the head and it travels
30:01
down Aaron's beard down his robes down to the
30:08
edge it's a prophetic picture of how impartation
30:14
works you plant yourself where God has called you to be planted under a specific leader who is Anointed a true
30:21
servant of God that servant of God becomes your spiritual mother or spiritual father
30:28
and as you position yourself there you stay planted there you don't go Here
30:33
There and Everywhere but you stay in one place focused there because God's called you
30:39
to one assignment and vision not Millions one you cannot be effective if
30:46
you're not focused on the one and being equipped there at the one place amen and
30:52
so as you simply position yourself there there the anointing automatically falls
31:01
upon you simply easily without effort it
31:06
just naturally comes upon you hallu
31:18
Hallelujah the principle of receiving healing and deliverance is positioning
31:25
yourself where the anointing is being released the anointing to destroy the yolks the anointing to heal the sick and
31:32
it is like standing under a waterfall if you want to get wet with the anointing to heal and deliver you you need to
31:38
stand under the waterfall simply to get wet if you don't go under the waterfall you won't get wet so many people are not
31:44
being healed and freed simply because this is God's system of releasing healing and Freedom by his anointing positioning yourself where the anointing
31:50
is just as they positioned themselves under Apostles Peter's Shadow and they were healed and delivered simply just
31:56
position thems there it's the same principle for receiving impartation of
32:02
the anointing the same principle you can get drenched with the
32:07
anointing and receive impart powerful impartation of anointing in your life continually flowing in you and growing
32:13
in you if you will simply get under the waterfall if you will simply get in
32:18
lined underneath Aaron's Aaron's
32:24
head it'll automatically flow on you
32:29
with ease the thing that people don't realize because the anointing has been rare is
32:34
that people don't realize that God is not complicated he's not trying to make things hard for you he he he wants
32:41
people healed and delivered more than you do more than any of us do so he's
32:46
not trying to make it so difficult he doesn't want us to have to put so much effort in make things so complicated to
32:52
see somebody healed or freed his anointing is enough it is more
32:57
than enough it is so powerful but we we need the
33:03
anointing and so just as as it is here with the um effortlessness you know
33:09
there's no need to put physical effort there's no need to put loud voice because it's the anointing that does
33:15
everything so as long as the anointing is there the anointing Jesus himself is the anointing is doing all the
33:22
work right and so it's the same way for receiving impartation
33:27
if you have a heart that God can trust he does not make it complicated and
33:32
difficult to receive it it's very simple position yourself stay there don't go
33:38
Here There and Everywhere position yourself where the anointing can hit you and fall upon you every day every week
33:46
week after week month after month year after year and increase in you
33:52
amen hallelujah
34:00
we see um we see we see uh with the this NE let's go
34:06
to this next scripture I didn't write it down but I think I sent it to you if not I can summarize it yeah this one this is
34:12
good First Corinthians 4:14 this is Paul he's saying I'm not writing these things
34:18
to shame you but to warn you as my beloved children for even if you had 10,000 others to teach you about Christ you have only one spiritual
34:25
Father for I became your father in Christ Jesus when I preach the good news to you so I urge you to imitate me
34:30
that's why I have sent Timothy my beloved and faithful child in the Lord
34:36
so he's saying that his beloved child is faithful to
34:41
him meaning like he is faithful to God's principles of staying planted and not
34:47
going Here There and Everywhere but staying in one place underneath the
34:53
leadership of apostle Paul amen
35:00
so we see this principle from Elijah to Elisha we see that Elisha stayed with
35:07
Elijah Elisha was even tested many times Elijah said go here and Elisha's like no
35:12
I'm staying with you and then it happens again Elijah says you go I'm going to go here you stay here and Elisha goes no
35:19
I'll never leave you and it happens a third time Elijah says I'm going over here you can stay here Elisha says no I
35:25
will never leave you he was tested his faithfulness his loyalty was tested and that scripture isn't just
35:33
randomly there there's powerful Revelation in that scripture to show us a principle of how to receive anointing
35:39
like Elisha received stay in one place don't leave this is God's principle of
35:46
receiving the anointing so we see that with Elijah to Elisha we see that from Moses to Joshua
35:54
Joshua wasn't going different places he was staying under the ministry of
36:00
Moses he helped to fulfill that vision and assignment that same vision and assignment that was given to
36:06
Moses Moses passed and didn't get to finish what God called him to do so then
36:11
Joshua took over you see the same vision and assignment but if Joshua wasn't loyal
36:17
and faithful like that he would not have been able to carry out that assignment he would not have received that
36:22
anointing from Moses and then we see it here again as Paul says you only have
36:27
one father you have only one place where you receive impartation this is a false doctrine
36:34
that that's go that goes around I see in the body of Christ because people don't understand how impartation works and the
36:41
anointing works this false doctrine of thinking I'm going to go to Every
36:47
anointed Minister and receive impartation here and receive impartation here receive the Evangelist impartation
36:53
here receive the apostolic impartation here receive the prophetic impartation here receive the teaching impartation
36:59
here anointing here and this is the thing we we love and honor every true
37:06
servant of God an anointed leader in the body of Christ but the the servant of God over
37:13
here that's a true servant of God and is Anointed I want his or her sheep to stay
37:20
there and stay planted I don't want them to come here when they're not called to because they are not going to be able to
37:26
receive re anointing they're not going to be able to fulfill their purpose if they're going here one week there the
37:32
next week they won't receive it here and they won't receive it
37:38
there I celebrate what God is doing there we're on the same team we are
37:43
equally important but they need to stay there and you need to not go over there those
37:50
of you that are planted here amen
37:59
and so um you know it just simply does not work this this this principle
38:04
because of this principle it cannot work to go to different ministers to receive different impartations that's not God's
38:11
principle it actually goes against God's principle and so even though you're there even if a hand is laid God sees
38:19
your heart God sees what you're doing he sees
38:25
your Disobedience to his principles and that anointing won't
38:33
come amen um when there is a true anointed
38:40
servant of God you you are planted under when they are truly anointed
38:47
especially Apostle and Apostle or prophet in terms of impartation of
38:53
anointing there is everything you need there God gives that servant of God that
39:00
leader that spiritual father or mother all the anointed needed for the impartation for everyone that's called
39:07
to be planted there if you are called to be a five-fold minister and Apostle Prophet
39:12
evangelist Pastor or teacher you will receive impartation of that anointing there and will not be lacking
39:20
anything and for whatever you are called to outside of that all you need is there we don't see
39:29
Apostle Paul saying well some of you might need to go other places cuz I don't have in terms of the anointing to
39:35
impart to you I don't have it for you no Apostles and Prophets are the foundation
39:41
of the body of Christ with Christ Jesus as a Chief Cornerstone it says in Ephesians 2:20 and so Apostles and Prophets they
39:50
they are um they they carry a higher level anointing and Authority
39:57
they're equipped and positioned for this amen that's just how God has made it to
40:04
be as they are part of the foundation we see the apostles are sent out first when Jesus sends out the apostles
40:12
they are sent out to begin and Pioneer the work of God now the fivefold
40:17
ministry is important to have all fivefold ministers and what God wants is for all of those Ministries to be
40:23
operating in the churches we will eventually have other offices of Ministries other prophets
40:30
evangelist pastors and teachers here ministering but just as in the times when the apostles were first sent out we
40:37
are in the beginning stages we are laying the foundation
40:43
Hallelujah and so Jesus he didn't make his disciples be you're an apostle
40:48
you're a prophet you're an evangelist you're a pastor you're a teacher and now here's one Church you're all starting it now God he had them all to be Apostles
40:55
because Apostles have the grace of pioneering the work of God of planting
41:01
churches and they have the grace to operate in all five offices when it's
41:09
needed for example I have the gift of a pastor but the office of an apostle
41:16
here I'm the office of apostle but I have the gifting of a pastor and a
41:21
special Grace of a pastor it is needed now we need Pastor
41:27
and God has has given me that Grace just as in the times of the in the acts
41:32
Church in the Beginning church it was just the apostles first sent out then we see prophets accompany them as well and
41:39
then we see other gifts come other offices come amen my spiritual father is
41:45
a prophet and so the anointing I have received is Apostolic and is
41:52
prophetic and that's strategic from God because in this reval rival he is
41:57
restoring the apostolic and prophetic
42:02
Ministries Hallelujah so it was purposeful from God
42:07
that I am an apostle and that my spiritual father is a prophet and so for
42:12
like for me it's the gifting of Pastor the anointing of an apostle and also the anointing of the prophetic I am not a
42:20
prophet but I carry the off the anointing from a prophet prophetic
42:25
anointing so like in this time now there's nothing
42:31
missing I mean in this stage that we are in now as time goes on there will be other offices but just in the time of as
42:38
the acts Church where the Apostle had Grace to operate in the other offices when it was needed that is what's
42:43
happening now so when God needs to speak something prophetically through me he
42:49
will do it amen when God needs to use me in an Evangelistic way he will do it
42:55
when God needs to use use me as teaching but that's a big role of the Apostle is teaching as is teaching as well he will
43:01
do it when God needs to meet to to Shepherd and Pastor he does it amen
43:07
hallelujah so that's I was sharing how when there's an apostle or Prophet who is the leader of a
43:15
church they carry the anointing to release impartation for all five-fold
43:21
offices so if you if if God has spoken to you you're called to be an evangelist
43:27
you're called to be a pastor or a teacher it doesn't mean you need to go find an evangelist to receive
43:34
impartation there if God is calling you to be planted here and you feel or you
43:40
know in your spirit you're called to be an evangelist or a pastor or a teacher or a
43:46
prophet you have all you need here to receive impartation of the anointing for
43:52
your purpose for your calling amen
43:57
and some people may be called to be planted under an evangelist and that's great but I'm just saying if you feel a
44:04
different calling in a different office it does this is like a wrong doctrine that goes around that you think you need to go specifically to that office to
44:10
receive that specific anointing the anointing isn't specific it's not like the anointing I carry is just
44:18
Apostolic it's the anointing of God is is all accomp all all all that God wants
44:24
to do all all of his power to cast out demons to heal the sick to for all the works of
44:31
God that's what the anointing is and so I'm not the office of an evangelist but
44:36
I can impart anointing for an evangelist and they will do things that I can't do but the anointing came through
44:45
imputation through me does that make sense amen just like um Elisha received
44:51
a double portion from Elijah it's not like Elisha was like I feel God's calling me to do twice as
44:57
much as Elijah so that means that I need to find a burning bush or something because I need to receive twice as much
45:03
so if Elijah only has half what I need I can't go there I'm better than
45:09
him but that's how people kind of that's the that's the kind of thinking that people have amen so that's how it is he
45:17
received double portion of what Elijah had but it was through impartation of
45:23
Elijah it's not we can't think of these things in the physical way this is
45:29
spiritual amen and God does it this way God um
45:34
makes it makes this principle of impartation the way to receive
45:41
anointing because when we do things this way we
45:46
won't misuse the anointing or at least it will be more fewer cases where people will misuse the
45:52
anointing because to come un to receive from another requires
46:02
humility requires loyalty requires faithfulness requires
46:11
servanthood and also God will speak to the servant of
46:17
God when it comes to releasing Mighty anointings like when it's time to receive to release like mantle basically
46:24
you know like a huge portion for this person to be a big Minister for example God will
46:32
speak to that person whether to release or not you know like God will speak their
46:38
heart is ready I want to anoint them release you know so instead
46:46
of um there not being any accountability now there is
46:51
accountability in this way it it is a way way that God molds our hearts to be
46:58
servant-hearted and humble and pure and remain that way and and and humble to
47:05
know like whoa I did not see the anointing work in my life but then I received impartation from my spiritual
47:11
father or spiritual mother and now I'm seeing the anointing flow in my
47:16
life and but it keeps you humble because
47:21
you know where you received from and you you know it's because of another person's
47:27
obedience um and so that that helps you to be humble instead of seeing yourself as like the greatest person in the world
47:34
you know what I mean like instead of seeing yourself as so great and so anointed you it it automatically helps
47:41
you to be more humble than if you were in your room God anoint me because I am so great and I
47:49
will do so many great things for you and the anointing comes and you're like yeah I don't need anybody God sees me like he
47:56
saw Moses you know th this is beautiful God's system
48:02
of releasing impartation of anointing cuz this is why he does it this is why it's the main way because it helps mold
48:11
that heart in us and keep that heart in us you know you have to stay connected
48:16
you have to stay planted to receive this anointed teaching to equip you to continue to equip you to continue to
48:23
make sure your heart is pure and you're not misusing the anointing and it's coming from a person above you who is
48:30
who is wiser than you more spiritually mature than you instead of just oh I don't need
48:36
anybody I'm anointed and God just teaches me himself you know but this way you're
48:44
receiving this pure teaching pure-hearted teaching to convict you to correct you
48:53
to protect you from going off the rails with pride and misusing the
49:00
anointing amen so this is this system of impartation is beautiful we should
49:05
respect it and thank God for it
49:14
amen um it's you know what's amazing is that we see Elisha who received from Elijah this impartation Joshua who
49:21
received impartation of anointing from Moses Timothy who received impartation of anointing from
49:27
Paul all of them didn't go off the rails none of them
49:34
fell none of them misused I mean from what we see recorded in the Bible they had Clean Hands and pure
49:43
heart but a lot of we hear a lot of stories today
49:49
of ministers falling right but we also don't see many
49:55
examples examples of impartation remember how God is purifying the bride right now this is
50:02
one of the ways one of the principles he's getting into place that has been lost impartation being planted true
50:11
anointed true anointed not self-appointed but true anointed leaders being the ones to equip to make
50:19
sure your heart is molded to be pure and releasing the anointing and being
50:24
accountable over you amen
50:31
hallelujah um I want to say this anointing is not something that you are entitled
50:38
to you can come here every week for years but never receed the
50:44
anointing you can be planted you can be doing this principle here but not
50:49
following the other principles of purity of humility of surrender of living a pure life before
50:58
God so it's not that you this is the only principle that I've been teaching right now this comes
51:04
second after you are surrendered you're living a Pure Life you have a pure heart
51:12
so what happens is people have amazing pure hearts um it reminds me of Pastor Heather she had this amazing pure heart
51:19
and God had taken her through refining fires God had had molded her gotten her ready but
51:26
she could have just cried out in her room anoint me God but the anointing wasn't going to come from this through
51:31
the ceiling from the sky through the ceiling into her room the anointing had to come through
51:36
this [Music] principle right so so when you have a pure heart it is simple the anointing
51:43
will come into your life it will pour into your life um but if you do not have
51:50
a pure heart if you're not surrendered the anointing won't come
51:57
I see I see some people say many times it kind of makes me laugh sometimes I
52:02
want a double portion of what you
52:09
have sometimes when people say it like in a certain way I can read like they think that it's just an
52:16
entitlement like we're all called to cast out demons heal the sick you're called to give me what you have give it to me and double
52:24
portion yeah so so it's important to it's
52:29
important to know that you're not entitled that the Bible says all who believe these sign shall follow but you're not entitled to
52:36
that so you should always come with a humble heart you should come with a humble heart you should see you know an
52:43
anointed vessel your spiritual mother your spiritual father me look with humble eyes you know come with a heart
52:49
of Lord anoint me but but but only Only For
52:55
Your Glory and only in your timing and only in your will and only for how however you want to anoint me not not
53:02
coming here with your agenda oh I want to have I want to have a big powerful Ministry I want to be
53:08
anointed and cast out demons this is my plan God anoint me I have this great plan it seems to align with your will I
53:16
know you'll you'll go along with it yeah people people are this way
53:24
though but but yes you should Cay for the anointing but you should really
53:29
humble yourself like God you want to anoint me you know we should always have that heart I mean
53:35
yes desire the anointing but understand this is the most powerful thing in the entire world it's more powerful than
53:42
anything in this [Applause] world and and so for God to entrust you
53:50
with any kind of measure of the anointing is the most humbling thing in the world it's really humbling it really
53:56
it's really humbling amen so um don't don't come with a
54:02
arrogant attitude of entitlement give me what you have double
54:09
portion it's up to God what he wants to give you even if you have a beautiful Pure Heart it doesn't mean you're
54:14
automatically going to get a double portion it does not I mean God has
54:19
different callings for everybody not everyone's called to be a five-fold minister not everyone's called to be uh
54:25
casting dealing with principalities so it's just important that you humble yourself and you
54:30
surrender to God lord anoint me but for your will and with the measure that you want and for however for for whatever it
54:39
is for it doesn't have to be to have a Ministry you know however you want
54:46
amen
54:54
hallelujah and and also I want to share that the am the amount of anointing you
55:01
receive like like how much God will release to you when your heart's right and when you're now positioned under the
55:07
flow it depends it's not a formula it's not a for it depends the amount you'll
55:12
receive I will tell you at first it will be a small portion for everyone and God wants to build upon that with your
55:17
obedience and surrender going glory to glory amen but um God has different plans for
55:24
everybody uh in terms of how he how much he wants to release
55:30
the anointing and the timing so for me I received this prophecy over my life
55:38
God saw my saw my heart he saw it was pure and surrendered um and and he called me to
55:44
be an apostle and he called me to walk in Mighty anointing um but he didn't just all of a
55:51
sudden when I received that prophecy and even nine months later when I started the church in that time in that short
55:57
period of time he didn't pour out this anointing and all of a sudden demons manifest the first church service that
56:03
we had no in fact it was 4 and a half years from hearing that prophecy over my
56:11
life until I start saw a demon manifest until I heard of more than a couple
56:17
healing miracal testimonies in my Ministry so for four and a half years
56:26
the anointing was not massive in me yet the anointing began pretty much
56:32
immediately but I couldn't see it was very tiny like a seed that you can't
56:38
see and then when I started the church nine months later I would preach and I would pray for people but I didn't see
56:43
any kind of manifest power of God but in that first year jeanal she came in that
56:49
first year and and within that first month or so she started sharing with me that she'd been a Christian her whole
56:54
life but all of a sudden she was able to fully surrender for the first time and things just started falling off her life
56:59
and her eyes open up to God's love like never before and so for her whole life she was in her low 30s at that point for
57:06
her whole life this was the first time so that indicated to me oh the anointing really is in me
57:13
Hallelujah and working through me but it was small at that point and I didn't hear too many other testimonies during
57:19
that 4 and a half year period of time and then all of a sudden four and a half
57:25
years later the first demon manifests and then it never stopped after that
57:31
demon manifest and Demon be cast out and it just increased so I mean for me I know
57:39
looking back I know God revealed to me I'm called to be this leader in the body
57:45
of Christ I and so that required a really
57:51
serious biblical kind of refining fire Wilderness period preparing me to carry
57:58
this anointing and be a leader it required my faith to be stretched so
58:04
mightily like a more than average so part of God stretching my
58:09
faith was seeing no kind of anointing Hardley for four and a half years and
58:15
the church actually getting smaller so God was like doing what he did with with
58:20
Joseph how it felt like he went backwards rather than seeing
58:25
hints of the promise you know so for me that's an example for me and that will
58:31
be a similar example for other people just because you're not seeing the anointing flow in your life and you're planted it doesn't mean you don't have a
58:37
good heart it could mean you're like me it could mean that God is doing specific in you stretching your faith in this way
58:44
of you not seeing anything but it's in you it's little and he's purposely even holding
58:50
it back like when that first demon manifested it's like the anointing was already in me but God was then ready to
58:56
release it you know and then all but but then other people like Pastor Heather she
59:03
came to the church just the third time right three times only and at that point
59:09
You' pretty much been planted whether you knew you were going to be planted for so long but you had made pretty much the decision like I'm planted here I'm
59:14
staying here I'm going to get under this flow I don't want to leave so God saw that principle that I've been teaching
59:19
about in her that she'd been obedient to that and she he had seen her heart previously previous years that he had
59:26
taken her through things preparing her and then the anointing immediately came and then it grew she immediately started
59:32
demons manifesting her ministry right then and there so see that's very different from what happened with me
59:39
there's going to be a lot of these instances in this revival and I've heard many testimonies of it from many people I have testimonies in in my book Pastor
59:46
Heathers is in there there's a few other testimonies but the testimonies in this book are also immediate impartation of anointing where
59:53
people saw demons manifest immediate medely started casting them out immediately this revival season is now
59:59
God is ready to move now he wants to see his people set free
1:00:06
now all over the world not just through one person not just through me but many people many of
1:00:12
you and so there's a lot of this quickening right now where God has been preparing a lot of you taking you
1:00:18
through Wilderness Seasons be prior and is now going to use you quickly now but
1:00:23
there is so much more to come and he'll release the anointing and then
1:00:28
and you'll see maybe demons go through you you know you'll see the anointing move but then
1:00:33
comes more refining more it's not like you're there you've arrived God wants to
1:00:39
increase you but every time he increases you you have to pass a test first he has to refine you more so you can be
1:00:46
prepared to handle the more amen
1:00:51
hallelujah praise God lastly I just want to mention this that how the anointing
1:00:57
is how the anointing is released so you position yourself here you get in the line with the
1:01:03
principle of Aaron how the anointing flows okay now these are different ways that
1:01:09
the anointing is released number one impartation is released number one by the laying of hands that's how um Pastor
1:01:16
Heather described happened to her 1 Timothy 4:14 passion translation don't
1:01:22
minimize the powerful gift that operates in your life life for it was imparted to you by the laying on of hands of the
1:01:27
elders and was activated through the prophecy they spoke over
1:01:33
you meaning of Elder prophetic meaning of Elder means someone who is wiser and more experienced in a place of
1:01:39
leadership in the church so that could be leader of the church so we see this biblical example of impartation of
1:01:45
spiritual gifts of anointing being imparted through the lane on of hands that's one of the ways that the
1:01:51
anointing actually comes upon you once you follow this principle of being planted under the flow of the
1:01:58
anointing and your heart's ready but that's not the only way the second um is
1:02:03
by pouring oil on the head 1 Samuel 16:13 Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his
1:02:10
brothers this is David and from that day on the spirit of the Lord Came powerfully Upon David So through oil
1:02:18
it's not that there's anything special with the oil but when God wants to use
1:02:23
oil to anoint someone it's like that same anointing that is in the servant of God then comes upon the
1:02:30
oil and then comes upon the person and that's just according to the leading of the
1:02:36
Holy Spirit many times that will be used with like ordinations like when God is like I am anointing you as an apostle
1:02:43
today like the beginning of a person's calling or Ministry of it being
1:02:49
activated in them or it can be when God wants to release a significant new level
1:02:55
or for a specific assignment there may be a special time where God will lead the servant of God to release the
1:03:01
anointing through the oil amen but it's so important we don't be religious people are so religious
1:03:07
with oil they buy oil they bring they bring it here Apostle Catherine just touch it
1:03:14
it has to be holy spirit Le touch it so I can put it all over my house no it has to be holy spirit L you don't need to
1:03:20
just buy any old o oil from the house and just say I anoint this and put over your house I w't do
1:03:26
anything being planted is how the anointing is released upon your life the spiritual principle being planted
1:03:32
there's a covering over you of protection that anointing is what's powerful in your life of you following
1:03:38
that principle of being planted not oil
1:03:46
amen not any old oil I should say um and then the last the last
1:03:52
overlooked way of of the impartation of anointing coming is by the declaring of
1:03:57
words acts 10:44 while Peter was still speaking these words the Holy Spirit
1:04:02
came on all who heard the message so that was the baptism of the Holy Spirit
1:04:07
but this is the same principle that different measures of the Holy Spirit including impartation can simply come
1:04:14
upon people by the Declaration of words Jesus spoke to the servant of a
1:04:20
centurion Soldier be healed and he was healed from a far away
1:04:25
distance so it that's the same principle for anything concerning the anointing
1:04:31
just by the Declaration of the word the anointing can be released to for to heal a sick person just by the Declaration of
1:04:38
a word the demon will leave a person just by the Declaration of a word
1:04:43
impartation of anointing can come upon another person there is a testimony also
1:04:49
in my book The Secret of the anointing of Richard an evangelist so him and his wife had had really
1:04:57
been planted at fold Church online watching every service and they came
1:05:03
this was also in 2021 the first year that the Revival broke out they came to Revival as now DC
1:05:09
at the National Mall and he was his story is just like Pastor Heathers where he had been a
1:05:15
minister and um their Ministry was small and he'd longed to see people really encounter God's power be freed and
1:05:22
healed there was no Tes monies in their Ministry of any kind of Deliverance and just maybe a couple healings um and he
1:05:29
just yearned with a pure heart to see God's power move through his ministry and free and heal people and so he came
1:05:37
to the Revival is now service and at the end I declared over
1:05:44
everyone that I release this anointing upon you and I declare from now demons
1:05:49
will obey you as you as you command demons to go they must leave people must be set free as you pray for them and
1:05:56
they must be healed in jesus' name receive this I just declared it over the whole crowd and he believed it's the
1:06:03
same principle of Faith you have to believe if you're like she must lay a hand on me then you miss out on what God
1:06:09
wanted to release to you but if you can have faith just like the Centurion Soldier Jesus you don't have to come in
1:06:15
person you can just say the word then you will receive what God wanted to release to you and and that he wanted to
1:06:20
releas it to you in this way and so he really had faith and he he
1:06:26
lifted his hands and he said I receive I receive and he really believed with all of his heart that he had received impartation I did not lay a hand on him
1:06:33
I didn't come really close to him he was just at that service in the crowd couple
1:06:38
days later he has his service and demons manifested for the first time and they
1:06:44
were set free the people were set free as he commanded the demons to go and that has just continued that just
1:06:52
as Pastor Heather it's just continued to be that way in his ministry that the anointing is flowing in him and people
1:06:58
are being set free and healed Hallelujah and there's been many testimonies from so many people from all over the world
1:07:05
whether it was here at fold church or at Revival as now events where just the word was declared and ever since that
1:07:11
day they started seeing the power of God move through them and people be free people be healed and people be touched
1:07:17
By God's power amen so so those are three different ways that we see
1:07:23
biblically how anointing is released once you followed this principle of being planted
1:07:28
in your heart being trusted by God so you don't need to worry you don't need
1:07:34
to I mean God can sometimes lead people like Pastor Heather she was led to you
1:07:39
know kind of just come forward you know but it it it's all about the leading of
1:07:44
the holy spirit for many people you'll just be standing where you are like that Richard uh evangelist Richard he was in
1:07:50
the crowd he just said I believe Lord and that was it that that was it so you and he received so you don't need to
1:07:56
worry you don't need to be like you need to release the impartation for me pray for me put your hand you don't need to
1:08:03
worry just relax it God sees your heart you need to focus on getting your heart
1:08:08
right and positioning yourself under that flow of the anointing and God will
1:08:13
take care of the rest God will anoint you exactly how he wants to and in the
1:08:20
timing of how he wants to release it to you amen
1:08:25
hallelujah hallelujah praise God I also want to
1:08:31
mention that every time you come here you are receiving more anointing you you release anointing and you need more when
1:08:38
you receive impartation it's not like oo I'm good for life I think maybe I won't
1:08:43
go to church as much or I'll go to church every week but I've already received the anointing so when Apostle
1:08:49
Catherine declares the anointing I'll just tune out it's time to receive you need more
1:08:56
every time you seriously it's a measure that you receive it's not a lifetime
1:09:02
supply it's a measure you receive freely you receive freely give and then you
1:09:07
also need to receive more so you can freely give [Applause]
1:09:13
again so you need to have that humble heart keep positioning yourself and keep
1:09:19
being expectant Lord I need more I need more of you I receive more today and I believe believe I have received it amen
1:09:26
let us not be stagnant here let us be excited and expectant to receive more
1:09:32
from God even when you're already healed and delivered this is exciting every Sunday to receive more of this anointing
1:09:40
in more levels higher levels for God to do more works and exploits through you
1:09:46
for more people to be saved healed delivered and touched Hallelujah let's have Revival hearts
1:09:53
Hearts on Fire every day every week every Sunday amen Revival is now not
1:10:02
yesterday it was yesterday but it's also now right now right now it's a new Glory
1:10:09
right now we're going higher today right now today will be the best day of our
1:10:15
lives right now hallelujah
1:10:22
hallelujah Hallelujah God's looking for these Revival Hearts here this is the this is
1:10:29
the well at fivefold church we got to keep the Revival fire
1:10:35
burning we got to be coming coming hungry every time as if it's our first time cuz we need more of God every time
1:10:43
and we We Are Spiritual and we're walking in faith that we will receive even more today more from God today and
1:10:50
what is more exciting than that nothing nothing amen amen hallelujah praise
1:10:58
God
