hi i'm apostle catherine welcome to
0:32
another episode of revival is now
0:36
in the last episode i shared how in this
0:39
episode i'd be teaching you the next
0:41
step of how to fully access the abundant
0:44
life that jesus has given you the first
0:46
step is hearing the full gospel
0:49
receiving it and believing it so
0:51
believing that jesus has paid a price
0:53
for you to have an inheritance from him
0:56
that all he has is yours that healing
0:59
freedom and abundant life is yours the
1:03
next step into accessing this abundant
1:05
life that's already yours
1:07
is to walk in authority genesis 1 26 let
1:12
us make mankind in our image and let
1:14
them have complete authority over all
1:17
the earth the nkjv version says let them
1:21
have dominion in the beginning god
1:24
created humanity he created adam and eve
1:28
and when he created them he chose to
1:31
give them
1:33
dominion
1:34
or
1:35
authority
1:37
over
1:38
all of this earth that means that god
1:41
didn't create adam and eve and humanity
1:44
to be like robots god he's given
1:48
authority
1:49
to humanity he's chosen us
1:53
to rule over this earth
1:55
now adam and eve lost that authority
1:57
when they sinned and obeyed the devil
1:59
what actually happened was the devil was
2:01
trying to convince them to give the
2:03
authority that they
2:04
had already the devil did not have
2:06
authority at that point but we are given
2:08
free will and so there's repercussions
2:11
with our free will when we use our free
2:13
will not according to god's will
2:15
so that's what adam and eve did they
2:17
used their free will and when they did
2:19
that they actually handed over authority
2:21
to the devil and this is the real reason
2:23
why we see all these curses were
2:25
immediately thrown upon humanity and
2:27
when immediately our great need for a
2:30
savior jesus came
2:32
it's because adam and eve gave the
2:34
authority they had to the devil so jesus
2:37
when he came one of the big things he
2:40
did on that cross and as he resurrected
2:42
from the grave was he returned authority
2:46
to
2:47
god's children
2:49
so that authority that god originally
2:51
intended for humanity to have
2:53
it's now ours because of what jesus did
2:55
when you become a child of god when you
2:57
give your life to jesus you receive this
3:00
as a part of your inheritance
3:02
authority
3:03
over this earth over the spiritual realm
3:06
of darkness you have authority over
3:10
demons over the devil
3:13
i have given you authority to trample on
3:15
snakes and scorpions and to overcome all
3:18
the power of the devil nothing will harm
3:22
you jesus tells the disciples this after
3:25
they return from casting out demons for
3:27
the first time he tells them yes the
3:30
demons obeyed you because
3:32
i have given you authority now this is
3:35
before jesus went to the cross but this
3:38
was prophetic of what he had come to do
3:40
this is what we would all receive when
3:42
we gave our lives to jesus part of that
3:45
inheritance that we would have
3:47
authority just as the original disciples
3:49
did
3:50
over
3:51
all demonic powers be strong in the lord
3:54
and in his mighty power put on all of
3:56
god's armor so that you will be able to
3:58
stand firm against all strategies of the
4:02
devil for we are not fighting against
4:05
flesh and blood enemies but against evil
4:07
rulers and authorities of the unseen
4:09
world against mighty powers in this dark
4:11
world and against evil spirits in the
4:14
heavenly places so this is a word to
4:17
believers to us today
4:19
that we are in a spiritual war
4:22
every single day
4:24
there is an unseen war going on in the
4:27
spiritual realm jesus has defeated the
4:30
devil
4:31
when he defeated the devil the powerful
4:33
thing he did of defeating the devil was
4:35
taking that authority from him and
4:37
giving it to
4:39
his children god's children
4:41
so the devil does not have authority
4:43
anymore that's why we can confidently
4:45
say he is a loser he can try to fight
4:48
all he wants he can try to attack all he
4:50
wants but he is a loser
4:53
no matter what
4:55
he's still fighting though but the thing
4:57
that he is fighting for
4:59
is for you to give him authority is for
5:02
you to do what adam and eve did this is
5:05
why it's so important for you to have
5:08
this revelation i have authority in
5:12
christ over the devil the devil doesn't
5:15
have authority over
5:18
me i am the winner through christ every
5:21
single day of my life we are in a
5:24
spiritual war every day and we can win
5:27
every single day but we need to actually
5:29
show up to battle to see the victory
5:31
happen
5:32
you can't be a champion without being a
5:35
warrior who laces up their shoes and
5:38
goes into the race that's why it says in
5:40
this passage in ephesians 6 be strong in
5:44
the lord don't relax on the couch in
5:47
life
5:48
but be strong realize you're in a battle
5:51
and let's go to work in the spiritual
5:54
realm it says put on all god's armor so
5:57
you will be able to stand
5:59
firm against all the strategies of the
6:02
devil so the devil has all of these
6:04
sneaky strategies and all these
6:06
strategies this the goal is simple the
6:09
devil is the father of lies so he is
6:12
lying to you
6:14
hoping you will not know this fact i
6:16
shared with you that you have authority
6:18
over him he's lying to you
6:21
hoping that you will be too lazy and not
6:25
use your authority over
6:27
him
6:28
you have to show up to this race you
6:30
have to show up to the war and use this
6:34
supernatural
6:35
weapons the the sword of the spirit put
6:38
on the supernatural protection the armor
6:41
of god
6:42
to defeat the devil the devil knows that
6:45
a lot of christians are ignorant and do
6:47
not know what is their right as a child
6:49
of god the devil knows that a lot of
6:51
christians don't know that healing
6:54
freedom protection abundant life is
6:58
theirs and the devil cannot steal it as
7:01
long as they execute their authority and
7:03
protect what is theirs
7:06
the devil knows it so this is his
7:07
strategy to come with these lies lies of
7:10
sickness lies of pain lies of lack lies
7:14
of anxiety lies of depression he'll
7:16
bring them they can manifest physically
7:18
these attacks they can come in your mind
7:21
they can come in your dreams they can
7:23
come in circumstances but you need to
7:25
understand that when you see these
7:27
attacks
7:28
these are weapons
7:30
formed against you but the bible says
7:33
that no weapon formed against you shall
7:35
prosper when you start to see these
7:37
attacks come in your life
7:40
know that you have authority to stop
7:42
these attacks these attacks
7:44
do not mean
7:46
loss in your life
7:48
when you get a diagnosis it does not
7:51
mean
7:52
oh no the devil won
7:53
this attack on my life and i have cancer
7:55
now you need to understand that these
7:58
weapons formed against you do not need
8:00
to prosper you can stop them from
8:02
prospering
8:03
but you actually have to take action you
8:05
have to use your authority to keep these
8:09
weapons from against you from prospering
8:11
submit yourselves therefore to god
8:14
meaning submit yourself to god's will
8:18
take his word seriously and do what it
8:21
says
8:22
believe that by his stripes you're
8:23
healed believe the abundant life is your
8:26
inheritance believe that you have
8:28
authority over the devil
8:30
and do what the word of god says
8:32
in order to claim this inheritance and
8:35
walk in it it's all over the word of god
8:37
directions on how to do this the word of
8:40
god is so valuable it is not just words
8:44
but it literally carries instructions
8:47
of how to walk in authority how to see
8:51
god's abundant life manifest in your
8:53
life
8:54
and how to win over the devil every time
8:58
how the action of resisting him and
9:00
rejecting him and seeing him flee
9:03
the word of god is like a blueprint to
9:06
walk in an abundant life but you need to
9:09
be reading the word of god with true
9:11
revelation of the holy spirit not on a
9:13
religious way or not reading it as this
9:16
is just words i need to read my bible so
9:18
i'm just reading right through it but
9:20
reading it with revelation
9:22
this kind of revelation i'm telling you
9:24
right now that these are the words that
9:26
lead to true
9:27
life
9:28
and here's an example james 4 7 submit
9:31
yourselves therefore to god resist the
9:33
devil and he will flee from you
9:36
so you have to submit yourself to god
9:38
number one and then number two you need
9:40
to resist the devil
9:43
resist the devil is an action word
9:47
resist the devil is actually an action
9:50
word of authority
9:53
if you think about
9:54
teachers they're in a place of authority
9:57
they step into the classroom knowing
10:00
that they have authority there that the
10:03
children don't have authority over them
10:05
they walk with that revelation and they
10:07
execute that authority sometimes they
10:09
need to speak up and they need to speak
10:12
with a firm voice
10:13
and
10:14
tell the children to stop misbehaving a
10:16
president knows he's in a place of
10:18
authority so if there's
10:20
attacks from other nations he knows it's
10:23
his responsibility he can do something
10:25
about these attacks these attacks do not
10:27
have to
10:28
prosper
10:29
he can go make a law execute an order
10:33
and things really happen and the country
10:36
is protected and the enemies are stopped
10:39
but the president has to know his place
10:40
of authority and actually execute his
10:42
authority you need to see yourself as a
10:45
person of authority over the devil
10:48
that's part of your identity in christ
10:51
and many christians are not walking in
10:52
this revelation when you don't execute
10:55
your authority the devil will just take
10:57
advantage of it the devil will just
10:59
steal it and he'll be the one in charge
11:01
throughout the word of god there's many
11:02
examples of
11:04
how we're supposed to execute this
11:05
authority and we're going to look at
11:07
some of these resist the devil and he
11:09
will flee from you is one of them to
11:11
resist the devil that's executing your
11:13
authority
11:14
it means the devil is trying to lie to
11:16
you the devil is coming with this attack
11:18
but he has no authority to win in this
11:20
attack you need to resist him though
11:23
if you are not resisting the devil
11:25
that's the action of accepting him
11:27
that's the action of allowing him to
11:29
come and continue his attack and this is
11:32
where we see
11:33
people who now have yokes in their lives
11:36
weapons were formed against them
11:38
but they
11:39
just let them come at them they let them
11:42
prosper and when you do that that's the
11:44
action of opening the door
11:46
and allowing that weapon to prosper and
11:48
to just come on inside
11:50
and you start to see now
11:52
the devil's portion over your life in
11:54
certain areas and you might wonder why
11:57
how did this happen
11:59
in in many cases it's because you were
12:02
not executing your authority and you
12:05
ended up actually just letting the devil
12:07
take over and having authority over you
12:10
so the bible says resist the devil and
12:12
he will flee from you it's really as
12:14
simple as that because you have
12:17
authority
12:18
when you resist him
12:20
it's a spiritual law
12:21
he's forced to flee just like how the
12:25
police are in a place of authority
12:27
and they
12:28
when those lights go on the siren behind
12:30
your car
12:31
you have to pull over there's no arguing
12:33
it when you resist the devil as much as
12:36
the devil will love to he cannot argue
12:38
it
12:39
he must obey your authority and he has
12:43
to flee
12:44
we really need to
12:46
see ourselves differently
12:48
there's many parts to our identity in
12:50
christ
12:51
we are children of god
12:53
we have a father who takes care of us
12:56
our life is in his hands
12:58
but we are also the spiritually mature
13:01
child of god yes but warrior
13:04
who has authority in christ paul
13:07
actually calls timothy a good
13:10
soldier paul also says
13:13
fight the good fight we need to stop
13:16
seeing ourselves as just mere christians
13:19
when we see ourselves as just mere
13:21
christians
13:22
church goers just going through the
13:25
motions of reading the bible and showing
13:27
up to church and praying
13:28
we end up being like civilian christians
13:32
god said let them have dominion not let
13:35
them just be church goers who have no
13:38
power so you need to start seeing
13:40
yourself as this warrior of christ and
13:44
you must stand firm in your place of
13:46
authority over the devil always we
13:48
demolish arguments and every pretension
13:50
that sets itself up against the
13:52
knowledge of god and we take captive
13:55
every thought to make it obedient to
13:57
christ
13:58
so this is speaking about how to have
14:00
authority over the devil in your mind
14:02
this is a big way that the devil is
14:04
coming with the weapons lying to you
14:07
trying to make you forget your authority
14:11
so he will lie to you he can lie to you
14:13
and say you should be so afraid god
14:15
doesn't really love you you're far away
14:17
from god he can lie to you and say
14:18
you're not going to make it you're going
14:20
to stay poor you're going to die
14:22
the sickness is not going away god gives
14:25
us this direction of how to take
14:27
authority and have victory over the
14:29
devil's schemes in your mind so it says
14:32
we demolish arguments and every
14:34
pretension that sets itself up against
14:36
the knowledge of god so this is this
14:38
other place where you need to take
14:40
action you need to use your authority
14:43
you need to be aware in your mind what
14:46
is not of god
14:47
the thoughts running around in your mind
14:49
do they align with the word of god do
14:52
they align with god's character and
14:54
heart
14:55
if not
14:56
that's the devil so you need to use your
14:58
authority and demolish those arguments
15:00
those lies and you need to take them
15:03
captive every thought and make it
15:06
obedient to christ
15:08
so
15:09
when i read this passage it reminds me
15:11
of police i think about police how
15:13
they're taking criminals
15:16
captive
15:17
they have a job and they're taking it
15:19
seriously and they are protecting lives
15:22
of people let's say someone is driving
15:24
recklessly speeding so they are they're
15:28
not going to let that person get away
15:30
with that they're going to arrest them
15:33
and they're going to take that person
15:36
captive they are very serious about
15:38
their job and they have authority to
15:40
take that person captive
15:42
we need to see ourselves like this like
15:44
police men and women
15:46
over our mind
15:47
this mind must be a place
15:49
where god's will remains it is a sound
15:52
mind it must be a mind full of peace and
15:55
joy
15:56
and god's thoughts and words only
15:59
no other voice is allowed to stay
16:02
so
16:03
you need to be your own policeman or
16:05
woman in your mind and you need to
16:08
patrol
16:09
you need to be aware do not let thoughts
16:13
just
16:14
go on and have their way in your mind
16:17
when you do that that is not resisting
16:19
the devil and that's the action of
16:21
allowing them to stay so if you
16:24
recognize thoughts that are not of god
16:27
lies of the devil
16:29
lies about who you are
16:31
who god is and
16:33
god's plan for your life you need to
16:35
reject them and take them captive
16:38
you need to make it known to the devil
16:40
that he cannot stay there that you will
16:42
not tolerate the lies to remain so how
16:46
do you effectively reject every lie and
16:47
maintain
16:49
god's will in your mind well you first
16:51
need to meditate on god's word read his
16:53
word this is where you get to know his
16:56
voice where you get to know
16:58
what his will is what his heart is this
17:01
is how you can discern between the
17:02
devil's lies and god's voice
17:05
in the word of god you'll learn that god
17:07
never gives you a spirit of fear but he
17:09
actually gives you power love and a
17:11
sound mind jesus has provided perfect
17:14
peace for you
17:16
so that means that chaos stress
17:20
fear
17:20
in your mind that's not of god jesus
17:23
provided healing for you so if you have
17:25
thoughts i'm sick i'm gonna get sick i
17:28
might inherit this disease it's in my
17:30
family line sickness is not god's will
17:33
those are lies of the devil god has
17:35
forgiven your sins and he sees you as
17:37
the righteousness of god he never
17:39
condemns you it says there's no
17:40
condemnation for those who are in christ
17:42
jesus so the voice of god is never going
17:45
to be shame
17:46
judgment condemnation these are just
17:48
some examples but this is why it's so
17:50
important you to read the word of god on
17:52
your own
17:53
for you to fully
17:55
know god's voice and his will and be so
17:58
sharp to be able to discern the devil's
18:00
lies versus god's truth so when there's
18:03
a certain lie of the devil that's going
18:05
around in your mind
18:07
you need to look at the word of god and
18:08
say what does the word of god say
18:10
according to this so if it's fear you're
18:13
feeling so much fear about something
18:15
specifically look to the word of god
18:17
where it talks about fear one example is
18:20
is that god did not give me a spirit of
18:22
fear but of power love and a sound
18:26
mind it also says that those who keep
18:29
their eyes on jesus will have perfect
18:32
peace
18:33
perfect peace is actually part of the
18:34
inheritance that jesus provided for you
18:37
on the cross meaning it's yours the
18:39
devil can't take it you really have this
18:42
inheritance of remaining in perfect
18:43
peace all the time
18:45
so as you read the word of god as you
18:48
analyze is this a crime in my mind you
18:51
know yes it is you find yes this is a
18:53
crime this is the devil's lie
18:55
you become like a policeman now uh-uh
18:58
you cannot stay what you should do is
19:00
first meditate on the word of god get
19:02
that truth in you in your heart and then
19:05
you can speak because there's power the
19:07
bible says the power of life and death
19:09
is in your tongue when you speak
19:11
this is a big way to execute your
19:13
authority so you can speak
19:16
fear must leave me
19:18
you can say it however you want you can
19:20
expand on it it doesn't matter exactly
19:23
how you say it but you need to basically
19:25
say fear get out
19:27
fear you can't stay
19:28
every spirit of fear must go every lie
19:31
of fear must go however you want to say
19:33
it i reject every lie of fear and so
19:36
that's you resisting the devil
19:38
so he must flee from you
19:40
and then begin to speak god's word over
19:42
your life
19:43
begin to prophesy this is how you're
19:45
bringing down god's inheritance of
19:47
perfect peace you're you're bringing it
19:50
down you're speaking words of life
19:51
you're speaking your authority you're
19:53
saying the devil's will can't stay it
19:55
must go
19:56
god's will must come so you can speak
19:59
god has given me
20:01
a sound mind i look to you jesus right
20:04
now renew your mind that jesus is with
20:06
you always visualize that he's looking
20:09
at you right now it's the truth he is
20:12
so
20:12
open your spiritual eyes by activating
20:15
your faith
20:17
meditate jesus is here with me right now
20:19
i look in your eyes right now you don't
20:21
have to see them in the physical realm
20:23
you don't have to have a vision but
20:25
you're looking in his eyes in the
20:26
spiritual realm by putting your faith
20:28
there that he is looking at you
20:30
you receive his eyes of love looking at
20:32
you his eyes of peace perfect peace
20:34
looking at you the bible says those who
20:37
keep their focus on me i will keep in
20:40
perfect peace
20:42
so just close your eyes and just look to
20:44
jesus just
20:46
spend some time just focusing on jesus
20:49
talking to him worshiping him
20:51
receiving from him being in his presence
20:54
and now you're accessing that perfect
20:57
peace the bible says you do have to
20:59
focus on jesus
21:00
to be walking in this perfect peace to
21:02
be staying in this perfect peace so make
21:04
sure you're getting to that place of
21:06
looking to him
21:07
focusing on him you will experience the
21:10
perfect piece of jesus coming upon you
21:13
dwelling in you replacing in your mind
21:16
the spirits of fear
21:18
this is what we should do in every area
21:20
of our life every area that the devil is
21:22
trying to attack the way to see the
21:24
devil lose and to have victory
21:26
is to walk in your authority to execute
21:29
it properly we are called to have
21:31
authority over all demonic powers in
21:34
this world as the body of christ
21:37
so
21:38
we are all given authority as soon as
21:40
you give your life to jesus but there's
21:42
different levels of authority
21:44
and the levels increase as you
21:47
effectively walk in authority that god's
21:49
given you
21:50
according to his will that you take it
21:53
seriously
21:54
that you do it according to god's will
21:56
that authority god will increase in you
21:59
it is the authority that jesus has given
22:02
us that makes demons to go
22:05
it's because we have authority over them
22:07
through christ
22:08
this is one of the biggest reasons why
22:10
we don't see many believers casting out
22:12
demons today in the body of christ
22:15
it's because they aren't walking in
22:16
authority at all they aren't walking in
22:19
authority over their own spiritual lives
22:21
so how could god increase their
22:23
authority to cast out demons how could
22:25
demons even take them seriously when
22:28
they're not taking authority over their
22:30
own spiritual life if you want to cast
22:32
out demons if you're praying for that
22:35
you have to start here you need to first
22:38
be this victorious warrior in your own
22:41
spiritual life before god can entrust
22:44
you with more authority to be dealing
22:46
with higher levels of demonic powers so
22:49
now that you know you have authority
22:51
it's time to live in this
22:53
every day renew your mind as you wake up
22:56
in the morning
22:57
i have authority over the devil today
22:59
over every strategy that comes my way
23:02
i'm going to execute my authority and
23:04
the devil must obey as i execute that
23:06
authority over him i'm going to show you
23:08
right now an example of what walking in
23:10
authority over the devil looks like
23:13
demons do not stand a chance when we
23:15
walk in our authority in christ every
23:18
demon here your time is up i declare you
23:22
