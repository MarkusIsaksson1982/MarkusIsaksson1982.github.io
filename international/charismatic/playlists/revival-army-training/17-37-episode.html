it's time to encounter more of Jesus today more of his anointing today amen
0:07
Hallelujah So today we're gonna learn about spiritual mothers and fathers
0:15
we're gonna learn about spiritual mothers and fathers this is a real thing
0:21
in the Bible that we don't see a lot today we don't hear the word spiritual mothers and fathers today a lot of us
0:26
don't know really what that means but this is necessary for your spiritual
0:31
health so we're going to learn what a spiritual mother and father does why we need them amen
0:38
so First Corinthians 4 verse 14 it says this is Paul speaking Apostle Paul
0:44
speaking and he's speaking to um his spiritual children and he
0:49
actually calls them children he says I am writing this not to shame you but to warn you as my dear children even if you
0:56
had ten thousand Guardians in Christ you do not have many fathers for in Christ
1:01
Jesus I became your father through the gospel therefore I urge you to imitate
1:07
me for this reason I have sent to you Timothy my son whom I love who is faithful in the Lord he will remind you
1:13
of the way of life in Christ Jesus which agrees with what I teach everywhere in
1:18
every Church so uh Apostle Paul right here is saying that you could have ten thousand
1:25
Guardians in Christ another uh translation says teachers you can have
1:31
many many different teachers many who teach you about the word of God but you don't have many fathers I became your
1:36
father so when he's saying you don't have many fathers he's actually meaning you only have one father
1:42
you can have many many teachers but you only have one father or mother but he's
1:47
a man so he's speaking father here but we can see this as father or mother
1:53
therefore I urge you to imitate me for this reason I have sent to you Timothy my son whom I love so this is Timothy is
2:00
his spiritual son who is faithful in the Lord he will
2:05
remind you of the way of life in Christ Jesus which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church I'm going to
2:12
read the passion translation now I'm not writing this to embarrass you or shame you but to correct you as the
2:17
children I love for although you could have countless babysitters in Christ telling you what you're doing wrong you
2:23
don't have many fathers who correct you in love but I'm a true father to you for
2:28
I became your father when I gave you the gospel and brought you into Union with Jesus the anointed one so I encourage
2:34
you my children to follow the example that I live before you
2:40
so here here is a powerful passage where we see that there are not just leaders
2:46
or mentors or pastors but there are true fathers and mothers
2:52
in the faith and you are all called to have a father or mother
3:00
for many different reasons which we're gonna learn today now children here on Earth we've all been children before
3:06
we've all had Parents maybe some of some of us were adopted so we either had biological parents or we uh we had
3:13
adoptive parents parents nonetheless we needed our parents for a lot of
3:18
things didn't we we really needed them at least up until 18 and most of us really needed them
3:24
beyond that even still need them today even but they are so necessary can you just
3:31
imagine life right now if you were born just put on the street fending for
3:38
yourself as a child even as a baby that does not work out
3:43
that will not work out well even if you're a kid who who is is fed up with
3:49
with having parents wants to live on their own wants to be independent and they leave the house they run away life
3:55
is not going to turn out very well for them right we need our parents in the Physical
4:02
Realm we need them to survive we need them to prosper we need them for protection
4:09
in the same way we need a spiritual mother or father
4:15
for us to prosper spiritually for us to be protected spiritually for us to learn
4:20
and be nurtured spiritually this is God's Design This is God's order
4:27
of how he builds up people in the faith he uses vessels vessels of spiritual
4:33
fathers spiritual mothers where God puts himself in and he releases teaching and
4:39
nurturing and impartation to you through a vessel this is God's
4:44
system and many times we don't know this or we've forgotten this in the body of Christ and we just try to live our own
4:52
Christian walk on our own or we go from church to church to church
4:57
to church with no covering with no father with no mother
5:02
you can think you're okay but in the spiritual realm you're a baby you're not growing in the spiritual realm you're
5:09
not protected in the spiritual realm you're not walking in the anointing that's the facts
5:14
and the devil doesn't want you to know this because this is where you will prosper this is where you are protected
5:20
this is where you will walk in the 19 no wonder the devil has tried to hide this
5:27
spiritual necessity no wonder he's tried to even demonize this
5:35
amen hallelujah so number one we need our spiritual father
5:42
or mother to teach and nurture First Corinthians 3 verse 1 it says this is
5:47
Paul speaking again however brothers and sisters I could not talk to you as to
5:52
spiritual people but only as to worldly people dominated by human nature mere
5:57
infants in the new life in Christ I fed you with milk not solid food for you are
6:03
not yet able to receive it even now you are still not ready
6:09
so Paul's actually saying I fed you I fed you
6:15
he means he's feeding spiritual nutrients teaching the word of God with
6:21
revelation this is what happens when you come to church here we have the Bible you have
6:27
the Bible but you need to be fed you need to be fed what this scripture what this what this scripture here means
6:33
what this scripture here means what it really means to follow Christ to to walk like Christ how to walk and the
6:40
anointing you need to be fed this you need to be fed this by your spiritual Mother by your spiritual
6:46
father first you're fed milk you can't be taught everything all of the Mysteries you can't handle them you
6:53
would choke on the meat like a baby cannot eat meat they'll choke you'll get confused you'll get lost
6:59
you'll run away because you're con what is this this mystery I can't comprehend this this is foolishness
7:05
because the Bible says that the things of the spirit are foolishness to the carnal man
7:11
so as a you know as a father as a mother a spiritual father a mother you have to walk with wisdom to know what people can
7:18
handle or what they will call this is foolish what is this but you have to first meet
7:24
feed milk this is what Paul's talking about he wants to get them to the place where he can feed them meat in fact
7:31
later he also talks about how you should be teachers by now you should be grown-ups you should be adults that can
7:37
eat meat and now teach other people but I haven't even been able to feed you meat yet you're still having to take the
7:44
milk so this is he's basically saying how that they are immature they need to be more serious about the things of God
7:51
they need to Humble themselves so that he can so that God can open their eyes so he can feed them the the meteor stuff
7:58
but this is what happens when you have a spiritual father a spiritual mother when you're coming consistently just like a
8:06
father or mother knows what you need to eat they know what time your your meals are need to be they know uh exactly
8:12
what's in the the the bottle they know exactly what you what you've graduated
8:18
to be able to eat next you know they they know what you like for example for kids so they know what you can eat in
8:25
the spiritual realm when you're coming consistently God is leading your spiritual father or mother to feed you
8:31
to literally feed you spiritual things what you can handle and in the timing
8:37
you need it so when there's a certain spiritual attack coming God knows
8:44
and as you're coming consistently where your spiritual father and or mother are you're being fed exactly what you need
8:51
so that you can have victory over the devil amen
8:56
Hallelujah thank you Lord
9:04
spiritual fathers and mothers they they lead also by example
9:09
First Corinthians 11 1 follow my example as I follow the example of Christ
9:16
so Apostle Paul is speaking once again he's our big example in the New Testament of a spiritual parent
9:21
spiritual father he says follow me as I followed the example of Christ
9:28
Apostle Paul was walking in this high level anointing God had entrusted him with this he was a trustworthy vessel he
9:35
was very spiritually mature he was a father in the spirit and so he had become
9:42
so much like Christ he had become more like Christ than most people so he so his life looked like
9:50
Christ so he actually instructed follow me as I follow Christ follow my example
9:59
see how I love people follow my example see how I speak with patients follow my
10:07
example see how I don't complain follow my example see how I work really
10:13
hard for the kingdom follow my example see how I've died to myself
10:18
follow my example see how I'm selfless follow my example
10:24
you see this is a beautiful way that God molds us to have the fruits of the
10:30
spirit is he puts examples for us to look at for us to observe for us to this
10:36
is this is the best way we can learn then just give me the fruits of the spirits and and just reading the word of
10:42
God and that's it but to see the example this is what the fruits of the spirit look like looks like this is what dying
10:48
to yourself looks like this is what being gentle and kind and patient looks like
10:54
this is what loving your enemies looks like so you should be watching very closely
11:00
your spiritual father your spiritual mother you should be following them on social media you should see what they're posting you should see what they're not
11:07
posting when people are slandering them and saying evil things against them
11:12
you should be watching them you should you should be looking at them looking at how they love people looking at how they
11:19
behave looking at how they speak and follow that example that's real
11:25
wisdom sometimes we're too prideful and we don't we don't put as much
11:30
attention there to our spiritual parent as we should but that's real wisdom to really look I
11:37
I see this as a christ-like person and I'm I want to I'm really gonna follow that example right there
11:44
I've seen Christ in this in this person more than I've seen in anybody I'm gonna follow that example
11:49
I have a spiritual father his name's Prophet Joe Davey he's from Tanzania East Africa he's the one who um
11:55
prophesied to me about six years almost six years ago that I was called to be an apostle when he prophesied to me I knew
12:01
that it was God speaking I got to quickly see the fruits in his ministry before he prophesied to me and I had
12:07
never seen Jesus like that I had never seen the power of God move like that and I just I just knew it's that knowing
12:14
this is God speaking now I didn't want to be an apostle so hearing that prophecy was crazy was wild was shocking
12:20
but I knew it was God speaking like how
12:25
Moses knew is God speaking and he's like I stutter I wouldn't why what do you
12:30
you're calling me this what but he knew there's no doubt that it was God speaking that's how it was with me
12:36
and then it became God's will for him to be my spiritual father and so he's been my spiritual father ever since that day
12:41
and the Bible says to give honor where honors do and I honor him I love him I
12:47
am so much of who I am today because of how God used him
12:52
I am who I am today so much because of his example I had never seen someone
12:58
look so much like Christ I've never seen someone so selfless I had never seen
13:03
someone so patient I had never seen someone walk in such the authority of Christ before and see demons tremble
13:10
demons go as through him I had never seen someone with so much spiritual wisdom and so I took did not
13:18
take my spiritual father for granted but I looked at his example I looked at
13:24
his Chrysler example I studied his christ-like example and it helped mold my heart it helped me to see wow if he
13:32
can be that loving to people who are so mean to him who are doing horrible things to him but the way he talks about
13:39
the past you know the way he talks about what people have done to him but he talks with so much grace and and
13:44
humility and strength I can do that too it really prepared me like even I mean
13:52
many of you know I've gone through a lot of attacks even recently the past couple of months a lot of people
13:58
um slandering me um speaking against me speaking against my Ministry and my spiritual father and
14:04
I think a lot of people wonder how I'm able to do it because it's like it's a lot of hate it's a lot of hate coming at
14:09
you and you know I'm on I don't we don't have like this huge team yet that's able
14:14
to like go over all my social media so I'm like looking at the comments you know and and getting rid of you know
14:21
sometimes there's there's there's bad comments you know so you delete them and so I'm seeing almost every day
14:28
hey come at me directly and I know a lot of people wonder like how do you deal
14:33
with it how can you you know remain full of joy and not get
14:39
bitter and not you know speak against these people that are speaking against you but I gotta tell you that
14:45
a big reason is is looking at the example of my spiritual father and he walks in tremendous power of God
14:52
and he's gone through intense spiritual attack himself he's gone through people per se so much persecution and I just
14:59
remember hearing him tell me one time about this and just um I just was like watching him like
15:05
tell me this all these stories of what people had done and but how God had been faithful how God had been faithful how
15:12
rumors were spread lies were spread and some people believed and many people would even leave the church but then God
15:17
would bring way more than who left and all that happened years ago and I
15:23
see I visited his church many times many times now and there's thousands that come there's several thousands I think
15:30
about 5 000 that come every single week and it's a lot like here where people travel every single week they travel
15:35
from different countries in different areas in the country to come and counter the power of God
15:41
um and so I see it now and I see him telling I was hearing him tell these stories and it shook me it shocked me
15:48
wow God is faithful I see it in him and I see how he responded I see you know he
15:55
he told me how he got through it he told me how he just kept doing the work of God with a smile on his face and stood
16:01
strong and didn't let the the haters get to him but just he knew who he was in
16:07
Christ the work of God was more important than anything and he wasn't ever going to let his Jesus down so he
16:14
was going to keep doing the work of God and showing up no matter how hard it was and doing it with boldness with
16:20
faithfulness with joy you know you can do that when you're when you're really when your eyes are on
16:26
Jesus and you all you care about is pleasing him you can stand with joy when when when when man so much hates coming
16:34
at you but it's supernatural but Jesus will give you that strength
16:40
Hallelujah Hallelujah and I remember I remember this was years
16:46
ago I remember hearing him tell me this these just various stories about disgusting
16:52
um lies that were made up about him and and even in many times it was actually his own own Pastor by Pastors in the
17:01
country that were jealous that's who would make up the lies and he was telling me these stories and I was
17:06
shocked because I had never seen such like crazy evil before such the Bible come alive you know and this was a time
17:13
when our church was really small this was years ago I had started to go through some of that intense spiritual
17:19
attack with jealousy with one a couple lies being spread about me rumors
17:25
um but nothing like what I was about to come to like this year so I look back and I just remember just listening to
17:31
him and and seeing the faithfulness of God through his life and learning how he got through it and and and and and
17:38
seeing how the devil is such a loser and also also being prepared being prepared
17:44
that that this is coming my way you know he was sharing this story to me years ago and I I was prepared I was like this
17:50
is gonna happen you know when the promises become fulfilled that's when the haters Sprout up out of the word
17:57
works and the jealousy come and the devil becomes insanely terrified
18:02
so that's gonna come for me so I gotta prepare myself I gotta do what he did I
18:08
gotta follow that example what my spiritual father did and I'll be okay but I gotta be prepared I'm not going to
18:13
be caught off guard the Bible says to be aware of the devil's schemes be aware
18:19
for the Devils roaring around like a lion and so I'm so grateful that I got to hear his stories and I got to see how
18:26
he responded and I got to see how the faithfulness of God prevailed in his ministry in his life and that's really
18:32
what's what's given me strength is following that example of my spiritual father
18:38
knowing if he can do it I can do it too if God could stand with him God will
18:44
stand with me too amen Hallelujah
18:49
but I really don't know I really don't think I would make it I actually I know I wouldn't make it I know I wouldn't
18:55
make it without my spiritual father I know I wouldn't make it through the crazy trials that have come if I didn't
19:00
have that example so I I've seen in my own life there's so many different ways this being one of
19:06
them how we need spiritual father spiritual mother
19:11
amen Hallelujah
19:16
Jeremy 17 8. it says they will be like a tree planted
19:22
by the water that sends out its roots by the stream it does not fear when heat comes it leaves its leaves are always
19:28
green it has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit
19:34
so this passage is actually talking about the revelation of this is talking
19:39
about when you are planted when you are planted
19:45
in a covering under a covering a covering meaning a spiritual father spiritual mother spiritual father
19:51
spiritual mother is always leading a Ministry is leading a church of some of some type A Ministry of some type
19:56
usually a church and when you plan yourself you will be like a tree who has no fear
20:04
of the heat who has no fear of the drought that bears good fruit always that sounds like a supernatural treat
20:10
why is that tree not afraid of the the drought and Heat
20:16
when the tree beside it is
20:21
it doesn't say uh uh a true you know a tree that's uprooted would would you
20:29
know it's speaking of a tree this tree specifically every tree is rooted but
20:35
this tree specifically you'll be like this tree that not only are you you have Roots going down
20:41
but you are not even afraid of the drought you're not even afraid of the Heat you are accessing Supernatural
20:48
protection not only are you accessing
20:54
the the blessings that come from that covering the blessings from being planted the impartation that comes the
21:00
anointing that comes upon your life but you are literally specifically accessing protection in the spiritual Realm
21:12
I repeat you are accessing protection in the spiritual Realm
21:18
Hallelujah there's a serious spiritual war at hand
21:25
out there and to be truthful many people wouldn't have already gotten in bondage that they
21:32
are now if they had true spiritual covering
21:39
true spiritual father and mother who was anointed who has true anointing
21:45
there are many people who live good Christian lives not even opening the
21:50
door for the devil but have bondage because simply they do not have the
21:56
spiritual protection that comes when you are planted where anointing is
22:02
you see this is God's order this is God's way and we see this is this is very clear throughout scripture many
22:09
times from the Old Testament to the New Testament God's system of being under a
22:14
father under a mother uh as we see with Apostle Paul it's very
22:20
clear he's not saying children are optional that he's making it very clear you do not have many fathers I became
22:27
your father this is God's order and so there's laws in the spiritual realm this is one of the laws of the
22:34
spiritual realm that when you are planted where God has called you to be planted under that spiritual covering of
22:41
a father or mother who is truly anointed truly called by God just like Apostle
22:46
Paul then you receive the benefits of that the the demons see that you are
22:53
following the spiritual laws correctly they see that you are obeying God you
23:00
are planted there and that protection from your spiritual and and your spiritual father or mother is coming
23:06
upon you that anointing that that that that that spiritual father or mother
23:14
went through so much went through a heavy cost to get
23:19
because God only releases anointing to Those whom he can entrust
23:24
Those whom he can trust with the anointing so that spiritual father that spiritual
23:30
mother went through Allah a cost for that power of God to abide in them
23:37
when you have when you come under that father or mother that anointing comes upon your life of
23:44
protection demons literally see that you have the
23:49
anointing of your spiritual father and mother upon you protecting you
23:59
it is a supernatural protection that doesn't come when just someone says I'm a Christian and I'd live my own Christian Life however it is a
24:05
supernatural production that comes and I could say that from experience from having a spiritual father for now
24:10
almost six years I've never felt so safe I've never felt like I don't have a care in the world a worry
24:17
in the world I feel so protective I've seen the protection of God over my life spiritual protection physical protection
24:22
I've even some sometimes my spiritual father has even been able to see in the
24:28
spiritual realm declaring things over me seeing how the devil's coming in a certain way and guiding me and and
24:35
giving wisdom and praying that I would be protected that the devil
24:40
could not come in that sneaky way you know
24:46
even certain things like people can have the devil hates the anointed and he will come in all sorts of sneaky ways
24:52
to try to make that anointing come out from you so people can come in weird ways like
24:57
wanting to lay hands on you with bad intentions with manipulative intentions
25:04
with wanting to be like wanting to be attached to you in a
25:10
in a not a good way in a not good motive way
25:16
and they can come and spiritually that that would be bad anointed could be
25:22
lost it could be bad for your spiritual health you could be confused their spiritual repercussions I've had my
25:29
spiritual father uh uh you know teach me these things and it's helped me I've seen I've seen even just administering
25:36
certain times where oh I see this is a way the enemy's trying to come in and I know what to do because I've been
25:42
trained I have that protection of the anointing upon my life amen
25:48
hallelujah hallelujah um if you are do not if you're not
25:54
planted where anointing is under that spiritual father or mother it is like being outside of a house a child
26:01
a child outside of a house it's easy for a kidnapper to get them or
26:06
someone to harm them but when you are planted in a place
26:11
where anointing is under that covering of a spiritual father or mother it is like being in a house that's locked
26:19
the kidnappers know they can't go in that's how demons that's how the devil
26:26
sees you when you have a spiritual father or mother
26:32
powerful amen hallelujah hallelujah
26:41
so so far we have this is what happens when you have a spiritual father and mother you you you are nurtured you're giving
26:49
spiritual food and you are taught to be built up to be a mature vessel of God
26:56
amen um number two you have someone who you can follow their example to be so much
27:04
like Christ because we need this we this is how God
27:09
molds our hearts to be like him makes us in the image of God we need to
27:14
look at an example also protect
27:20
you have spiritual protection and now lastly
27:26
you inherit anointing
27:31
all of these things I just listed teach and nurture protect you have an example to follow this is the same as physical parents you see how there is it's the
27:39
same but in the spiritual realm it's a necessity also you inherit from your parents right
27:46
um if if if if if if a parent has has a certain business that's prosperous maybe
27:52
he can give that business to his to his child and that child can now prosper in
27:57
that business just the same as the parent did and usually usually more
28:03
so it's the same exact as what the parent had the great blessing that the parent had and that's just given to him
28:09
Boom the parent might have had to work super hard for the business but that's just given that's an inheritance
28:16
and now they can go even higher with that business he can prosper even more so in the spiritual Realm
28:23
your spiritual and father spiritual mother or father usually has gone through a lot I shouldn't say usually
28:30
always has gone through a lot has gone through they paid a price there's a price to
28:36
walk in the anointing they've gone through many trials they've gone through many years to carry this anointing for
28:42
God to release his anointing to them when you come under that spiritual
28:48
father or mother this anointing becomes yours more easily
28:54
you do not have to do as much as the father or mother did to walk in that
28:59
anointing and we've seen this right here for an example
29:05
um four and a half years I believed God was going to use me in power to walk in miracles for demons to be cast out for
29:11
people to be healed and I preached every single Sunday for four and a half years and ministered every most Fridays as
29:18
well and saw just a handful of Miracles no demons cast out no big like Revival
29:24
Miracle whoa Revival is indeed here because of what God has done like we're seeing now and so I'm just believing and
29:30
believing and God's taking me through quite the trials quite the testings and
29:35
um the church was staying very small we started with 20 we decreased from 15 to 10 to 5 to even two through those four
29:42
years by 2020 there was just on Tylenol at one point um and so there was a there was a quite
29:50
a price that I paid and it took a while it took four and a half years of just that every day I mean it was even longer
29:57
if you consider my whole Christian life but when it came to this is the promise
30:03
now God's calling you to obey him in this and believing that it's going to happen any day now it was that for four
30:09
and a half years of intense testing paying the price
30:15
and now here at fivefold church and at the
30:20
Revival events we are seeing people receive impartation of anointing
30:27
and immediately going cast out demons I was shocked when I first saw that I
30:34
was like oh it doesn't take four and a half years for you Hallelujah I'm happy for you
30:42
I was truly shocked like I knew this principle but I didn't know like how it
30:48
was gonna happen in my life and my Ministry for my spiritual children
30:53
um there was a gentleman that came I remember the first testimony of when I heard armpitation happened was just just
31:01
in April this gentleman came from Miami and he watched his sister be delivered it was so powerful he went back to his
31:08
home received impartation just it was just a declaration I declared to everybody I didn't lay hands on him or
31:13
anything specifically but he went back to Miami and he prayed for two different family members and Damon started manifesting in them and we're cast out
31:20
of them and I was shocked because it was like one time wow and he received and since
31:28
then there's been uncountable testimonies of that um Pastor Heather is one here who she
31:34
Hallelujah she pastors a church in Redlands which is an hour and 15 or so minutes away and she comes here she
31:41
started coming here after her service every single Sunday um like since last June or something
31:46
June last June and like I think the third time you came
31:51
right the third time she came she came just so hungry and humble and came to me like I want what you have I want that
31:58
anointed I want to see the people in my church and the people in my community be set free I want this and God released it
32:05
to her through me impartation and immediately immediately demons were cast
32:11
out in her church and it's been like that ever since right over 100 now Hallelujah
32:19
Hallelujah and her husband too now is walking in the power of God as well as casting out
32:24
demons as well Hallelujah Hallelujah come here you want to share share it
32:39
this is the greatest transformation of my life
32:44
and I never saw it coming but I had a hunger and the Lord drew me here last
32:50
summer and I my whole life has changed my whole Ministry has changed our church
32:56
did go down during covet and it went down I says Lord what's going to happen now we have an entire group I'm just
33:03
going to say it's mostly women right now but I'm calling the men in that are so on fire and all of them have received
33:10
Deliverance that's why they came because of the deliverance and now they're growing in the Lord and they're taking
33:16
the milk of the word and they're taking little by little but it's growing and it's because I never saw this coming
33:24
this way but what I received from that impartation was something I didn't even know existed and I've been a Christian
33:30
for almost 44 years but when it was offered you better believe I wasn't going to turn it down
33:37
and I I saw you on social media I said this is what the world needs this is
33:43
what the world needs and I can't even begin to tell you what it's meant to me and to everybody around me everybody
33:52
healings and deliverance things that I've wanted for years that are now
33:58
manifesting and now it's just mushrooming out it's mushrooming out and all the people at our church and they
34:04
all love you they all love you we speak so highly of you and the ministry
34:10
because I know and I have paid some prices but we're going all the way with
34:15
this this is not going to end Revival is now
34:20
hallelujah hallelujah
34:25
proud of you God is so proud of you you are you're a leader in this revival
34:31
and you are leading so many you have no clue but I know that meant there will be
34:37
people who come up to you and say I believe that I could walk in the power of God because of you and I see there
34:43
will be people there will be pastors there will be people that said You challenged me to humble myself
34:50
your example just like I was saying we need examples there's people following your example as
34:57
you follow Christ and so so many people God is so proud of you because he says so many people are
35:03
able to walk in the power of God are able to Humble themselves they'll be pastors that will humble themselves and receive the anointing only because they
35:09
saw your example Hallelujah
35:14
praise God I praise God wow thank you Jesus God is
35:20
so good amen he leaves us truly in awe and wonder
35:25
um there's another Demaree who was here last week she's now 18 years old but
35:30
just she's come here a few times she lives a few hours away but she watches online all the time and
35:37
um within I I don't know like I'm a little more than half a year of watching online
35:42
all the time that anointing just was birthed out of her by receiving that importation and now she's casting out
35:49
demons regularly as well going live and praying for people and
35:55
people are being free through an 18 year old 13 year old same
36:00
story um and these are just a few stories but uh like the 17 year old and and we all
36:08
have to pay a price to walk in the anointing there's everyone does but I just like I was just amazed wow like
36:14
that's so amazing she gets to receive she doesn't have to go through all the years you know revivals now and he
36:21
really wants to use this anointing mightily I had to pay a a little bit
36:27
bigger price and more years to be a mother to be a spiritual mother to be the one that releases but you get to
36:35
grab this and don't have to go through as much so it's a blessing to have a spiritual
36:42
father or a spiritual mother uh same for my spiritual father
36:47
um he went through way more than I did four and a half years seems like a lot but for him it was even more and he was
36:54
a prophet since he was a kid he was prophesying things as a very as a young child so he went through much more and
37:01
even he was like pioneer pioneering so much when profits were not accepted when
37:06
the power of God was really not accepted even more so than what we see today so like he had to go through more for me
37:12
and now I get I had got to go through more for you and and some of you will will go through
37:19
more for your some God's calling some of you to be spiritual fathers and mothers someday as well too
37:24
so it's a blessing that you know why wouldn't you have a spiritual father and
37:30
mother when this is a gift this is a blessing just like in the Physical Realm your parents can teach you I already
37:36
like have these things I know I'm going to tell my kids like don't do this I made this mistake don't do this I'm telling you from my heart like I really
37:42
wish I wish I listened to my parents about this so I'm gonna tell you with like super so much passion don't do this
37:49
you know like I already like I already planned this for my kids in the future
37:57
um so just the same way in the Physical Realm that's how it is in the spiritual Realm
38:03
amen hallelujah so we see this inheritance it's this is an inheritance
38:09
that comes just like and it's a specific inheritance like uh specific anointing like you you would specifically inherit
38:17
if if your father had that business that car business you inherit that specific business
38:23
and if it's an if it's an amazing car business that's very exciting right so
38:28
if you if your spiritual father or mother walks an extraordinary anointing like Apostle Paul did it says Acts 19 11
38:35
that God was using Apostle Paul an extraordinary Miracles that's what it says extraordinary another translation
38:42
says unusual so if your spiritual mother is walking an extraordinary anointing
38:48
then you will walk in extraordinary anointing it is the same anointing that
38:54
comes upon your life it's not a different kind of anointing it's the same anointing and this is what
39:01
was so just it was it was beautiful for me to see because I know something so special about what God's doing here in
39:08
this ministry and this revival movement is is this big it's like big Power and
39:13
little effort Mighty power of God with little effort or Little Words
39:21
you know I don't have to say tons of words to cast out a demon or repeat the words many times or do loud
39:28
voice or use hands but out on three one two three in Jesus name
39:34
go you can say it softly I was I lost my voice one week and the power of God moved just as mightily glory to God I
39:41
was like I'm really one two three go and they loved I was it was so amazing for me to see wow it's really all God's
39:48
power but really this is specifically what God's doing is is extraordinary in
39:54
power big power but few words little effort Little Words little effort big
39:59
power of God that's a specific anointing that's here hallelujah
40:04
well we don't have to strive or struggle but God's power can really be revealed we can really see how powerful God is
40:11
the anointing can actually do the work rather than us get in the way and not do as much because we cannot compete with the anointing amen and so it was so
40:19
amazing to see um like I saw Demery the one who was here last week and I saw
40:24
Jordan young young man who's casting out demons as well 13 and I saw their video
40:30
online and I'm seeing it's looking just so similar it's looking like demons are going quickly you know and like wow
40:37
that's the same anointing that's so beautiful this is amen
40:43
this is what um happened with Elijah to Elisha Elijah walked in this Mighty
40:49
anointing was walking in signs and wonders and miracles and then he had a spiritual son Elisha and this Elisha
40:57
planted himself underneath Elijah he says I will go with you everywhere even there was testing to see if he would
41:04
really be planted or leave Elijah was like you can you can stay there while I
41:10
go here Elisha says no I'm following you everywhere
41:15
and that's him being planted and that's a principle of receiving the anointing to stay planted and to serve that
41:23
anointing to serve where God's kingdom is where he's called you to so he was sustained planted and serving Elijah so
41:32
that that anointing could come upon Elijah that same anointing in Elijah could come upon Elisha and so then he
41:40
received the mantle that's what the meaning of mantle is is that same anointing comes upon another
41:48
comes upon the spiritual son or daughter and and he received a double portion
41:55
of the anointing and it was the same anointing it was the same mantle and so the Bible is talking about him now doing
42:01
literally the same specific exact Miracles that Elijah was doing
42:06
because it was the same anointing coming upon his life this is what we see with Moses to Joshua
42:12
Moses could not make it to the promised land some of you are are doing things that your parents could not do Joshua
42:19
could now further the kingdom and do what Moses could not do Joshua received
42:24
the anointing from Moses that same anointing he was doing similar Miracles and he was able to lead the Israelites
42:31
finally into the Promised Land Moses started the job and his son
42:37
finished the job it's all about Kingdom that's why that's why we need this
42:43
family the spiritual father children because we're not going to be here all day I'll
42:49
we're going to be here forever we're gonna die someday we need to
42:54
release what God's given us to them so that they can further God's work
42:59
we are not here for our own Ministry our own dreams our own ambition we are here to to advance the kingdom of God
43:08
we're here for God's work it our dreams don't matter we're here
43:14
for God's work so like my assignment has nothing to do with me my assignment has
43:20
everything to do with what God wants to be done so when I pass on there will have to be
43:26
people who carry further what God first called me to do
43:32
who continue to advance the kingdom and true fathers and mothers have that
43:38
heart in the Physical Realm and in the spiritual realm in the Physical Realm you want your children to do better and
43:45
more than you did want you want them to be more successful than you you I've
43:51
never and I've never had a physical child but I know physical parents they always say my parents say that your life
43:57
just became about your child you care more about your child than your own life your dreams went out the window
44:03
now you just cared about your child and that's the heart of spiritual fathers and mothers
44:09
their dreams are out the window and they their eyes are on equipping the
44:15
children that God's entrusted them with what do my children need
44:22
to be built up to have victory over the devil what do they need to hear what food do they need to receive
44:29
what is it that's missing how can I help them be better that's the heart that's the True Heart
44:35
of a spiritual father and mother that's why we need them amen they have what we don't have and
44:42
they have the heart for us to go further than themselves this is the heart of God that we go
44:48
glory to glory this is why Elisha received a double portion because Elijah had that heart beautiful
44:55
heart of God for for his for his son to go further than he did
45:01
for the Kingdom's sake because it's all about the kingdom not about how great we are how successful we are how powerful
45:08
we are it's all about the kingdom
45:14
Hallelujah Hallelujah
45:20
and now um I want to also share now how we can have
45:27
fathers or mothers we hear spiritual fathers so much more often and the religious spirit has
45:35
worked really hard to try to keep women from preaching and women from leading
45:42
twisting scriptures there's a scripture that says first Timothy 2 12 I do not
45:47
allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man but to remain quiet in the congregation and Apostle Paul
45:54
speaks this when when we look at scripture we need to look at the context of what was going
46:00
on in the time period so what was happening who's saying this who he's saying this to and what was going on we
46:06
can't just read the words without that context so if you look at the context of that
46:12
scripture in those days the women were being wild the women were not coming
46:19
with order in the church culturally the women were to be frank just being out of
46:25
order being wild um and and they weren't coming with wisdom and humility in the body of
46:31
Christ they were speaking out they were being loud they were trying to even compete with the men in terms of
46:39
spiritual gifts and everything not with good intentions culturally this is how
46:45
the women were in that time by and large most of them so Apostle Paul was
46:50
speaking a prophetic now word a prophetic word of today of that time of those times
46:56
saying for the sake of the Gospel to be preached for people to not be distracted
47:01
by what the women are doing here I need to speak this so he spoke this word but this word was
47:09
not a word intended for every person in the body of Christ this word was not intended for us here in 2022 today this
47:16
word was a prophetic word that he was speaking for that time only just like if culturally the men here is
47:25
making the men to just culturally what was going on maybe through politics just
47:30
just a scheme of the anime enemy maybe of what was going on the men here were
47:35
just really loud and disruptive here I could say here right now when men here
47:40
be quiet but I'm not saying that for every man
47:45
I'm saying that because in L.A this is the culture of what's going on it's making the men in general by and large
47:52
be like this act like this that's what he was doing at that time and so God never intended it to be only
47:59
men leading only men preaching only men pastoring never never but but actually it says it says that
48:08
acts 2 17 in the last days God says I will pour out my spirit on all people
48:14
your sons and daughters will prophesy young men will see Visions your old men
48:19
will dream dreams it goes on Acts 2 17. so men and women the spirit will be
48:25
poured upon all men and women alike and we also see even in Romans 16 1 an
48:31
example of a woman actually being a minister being a true leader in a church
48:37
this is Phoebe Romans 16 1 this is Passion translation uh Paul's saying let
48:42
me introduce to you our dear and beloved sister in the faith Phoebe a shining minister of the church in sangria I am
48:49
sending her with this letter and ask that you shower her with hospitality when she arrives so he's sending her to preach the gospel at this church as a
48:56
minister Embrace her with honor as is fitting for one who Belongs to the Lord and is set apart for him she's set apart
49:02
as a minister so provide her for whatever she may need she's been a great leader and Champion for many I know for
49:09
she's been eat that for even me so she's called here a leader and a
49:14
minister also in judges 4 4 in the Old Testament we see Deborah was a Prof a
49:19
prophetess and a judge it says now Deborah A prophetess was judging Israel
49:24
at that time and she would sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Rama and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim and
49:31
the children of Israel came up to her for judgment for that leadership so these are just a couple examples of how
49:38
women are leading our ministers throughout the word of God
49:44
um marriage roles are different from how God wants to use a vessel in Ministry
49:51
they are completely different when the Holy Spirit comes upon a man and a woman is the same Holy Spirit
49:59
there's not a male version Holy Spirit there's not a female version Holy Spirit
50:04
and in the Physical Realm we're different men and women are very different
50:09
right and women tend to be like more like emotional I guess you say you know there's there's these
50:15
distinctions usually but when the Holy Spirit comes in a man and
50:21
woman and takes over the man or woman and transformed them into the image of God so that they are a vessel of Jesus
50:28
ministering there's no female or male anointing Holy Spirit coming out of male
50:36
or female it's the same Holy Spirit and so the Holy Spirit coming through
50:43
this word of God ministering to you now is not a female word that you're getting
50:49
it's it's it's the same Holy Spirit when I I I'm praying for you and casting out
50:55
demons it's not a female anointing it's just the anointing it's the same
51:02
God it's the same Jesus and our Authority in Christ is the same
51:08
men and women have the same authority over demons
51:14
and so man or woman can cast out principalities alike
51:19
high-level demons alike so in terms of you being equipped you
51:25
receive in Ministry you have in a spiritual parent it can be father or mother that just depends on God's will
51:31
for your life God will lead men to sit under women in their that's their spiritual parent a
51:37
spiritual mother and that's God's will for them to receive anointing just like there's a gentleman uh from uh
51:44
Virginia who he's an evangelist and he's never seen the power of God move mightily to cast out demons and not much
51:50
healing either and so he came to the service that I administered at the National Mall in DC hungry to receive
51:57
the anointing he didn't look at me as a female or male he just looked at me as a place to receive anointing
52:03
that God was calling him to and I declared it and he says I receive I receive it by faith and that next
52:09
Saturday he went and demons trembled for the first time and he cast demons out for the first time and it's continued
52:15
ever since then and his wife now too Hallelujah Hallelujah so it's just God's will
52:23
whether you're call it's not like men are called to have a spiritual father women are called to have a spiritual mother no no it's God's will for it to
52:30
be mixed it'll just be according to God's will like as as you hear or most of you hear many of you here maybe all
52:36
of you here are called to be here planted here and me as your spiritual mother
52:41
Hallelujah Hallelujah thank you Lord
52:48
thank you Jesus praise God praise God and I want to mention too
52:53
that your spiritual father your spiritual mother um because the days that we are living in
53:00
now you don't have to be talking to one-on-one like for them to be your
53:06
spiritual father and mother a spiritual father and mother is also your Mentor it is possible to have a mentor and a
53:11
spiritual father or mother but you need to have a spiritual father and mother and if you don't have a separate Mentor
53:17
your spiritual father mother is your mentor and that works too amen but don't feel like you're lacking if you're not
53:23
having that um one-on-one like consultation or talking one-on-one God is so good and
53:31
will answer the questions that you have even even me I tried to do uh q and A's
53:37
once in a while and I'm looking at questions and even if I can't respond to all of them I I try to teach on a
53:42
different time but God is so good he knows what you need to hear there's been so many people even last week you know I
53:48
I just preached a word about how to be on fire for God and I you know I didn't know that oh this person needs to hear
53:54
this this person is this this person needs to hear this but there are several people who wrote to me saying I needed
53:59
to hear that word that answered my questions amen so when you are really planted God
54:06
is so good he's in control and he leads your spiritual father or mother to release all that you need that you would
54:12
be lacking nothing and even if you don't get an answer right away oh I want to know I need to know what I should do for
54:17
this thing maybe it's not God's will for you to know right away but he wants you to be patient and keep seeking and he
54:23
will release it to you when he knows you need to really have the answer amen hallelujah hallelujah praise God
54:32
thank Jesus thank Jesus that he is restoring
54:38
his original design to the body of Christ that we would be lacking nothing that we would have spiritual parents
54:44
spiritual mothers and fathers that we could receive anointing from impartation from that we could be equipped lacking
54:51
nothing Hallelujah you know when you have a parent you're you you don't
54:56
you're not really worried about much you're taken care of you don't have to fend for yourself when you have a spiritual parent it's
55:03
like that it's like worries gone God you are safe you are planted as a tree you
55:09
have protection coming to you and and you are you are doing what God's way is you're
55:16
you're you're you're you're getting in order with God's way and that's where everything is taken care of that's why
55:21
you're spiritually safe and the devil cannot get to you amen hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus
55:29
you can stand to your feet
