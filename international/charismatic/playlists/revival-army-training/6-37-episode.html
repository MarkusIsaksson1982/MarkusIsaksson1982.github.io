I'm sharing a message called Deliverance revived
0:06
Hallelujah in Mark 1 38 it says Jesus replied let
0:11
us go somewhere else to the nearby Villages so I can preach there also that is why I have come so he traveled
0:19
through Galilee preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons
0:28
this is what Jesus did simply this is like a simple explanation of what he was
0:35
doing preaching in the synagogues preaching in different churches and what
0:42
casting out demons there is an and
0:48
this was the ministry of Jesus to preach the gospel
0:54
and to cast out demons out of people that are oppressed and heal the sick
1:00
and raise the Dead but today in the body of Christ
1:06
even though it's so clear in the word of God so many people don't realize
1:12
it's clear as day here but so many people don't realize this is what Jesus was doing this was his
1:20
ministry preaching and the end of casting out demons
1:27
and he has called us to do the same today Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
1:32
there where he was preaching the gospel and casting out demons he's the same there as he is today today it is Jesus
1:40
doing the same things but he's doing him through us as vessels
1:49
he has not changed that's what he came to do back then and that's what he's
1:54
wanting to do every day since then through us but many people have stopped him from
2:01
moving in that way because he doesn't force himself through vessels he gives us free will
2:07
so so many people have limited him and says I'll just take this part of you I'll do the preaching part but not the
2:12
and casting out demons part but this is the ministry of Jesus people
2:20
Body of Christ world this is the ministry of Jesus
2:28
and Matthew 10 verse 7 um this Jesus now is training up his
2:33
disciples because he knows the plan he's here to train them and then he's going to put his power in them he's going to
2:40
live in them and they're going to do the works he did and greater so he gives them this instruction he gives them this
2:46
Commission okay as you go and minister to people
2:51
Proclaim this message preach the Kingdom of Heaven has come near
3:00
and then he continues with instructions heal the sick
3:07
raise the Dead cleanse those who have leprosy
3:12
drive out demons
3:17
freely you have received freely give freely you have received Deliverance now
3:23
you need to freely give Freedom that you've received freely you received my love my power
3:31
Without Limits not tainted now freely give my pure love
3:37
Withholding Nothing even if it makes you uncomfortable sometimes freely give it don't withhold
3:44
any of it so Jesus did not say to the disciples
3:50
all right guys you guys here you're going to be the Deliverance Ministry crew
3:57
these are the Deliverance ministers and then I have some other people trained up they're going to be the preachers
4:03
and then I have some other people trained up they're going to be the healers they'll take care of the healers so you guys you're going to be casting
4:10
out demons you guys are going to heal the sick you guys are going to preach Jesus did not say that
4:15
he said to his disciples who are his Representatives
4:20
he's saying this to us today the same thing you need to do all of these things
4:28
heal us It cast out demons raise the dead cleanse those with Leprosy all of these things
4:34
so this is what being a Christian looks like this is what being a minister
4:40
looks like Apostle Prophet Pastor evangelist teacher this is what it looks like not
4:48
all Apostles they cast out demons and that's it no not pastors oh they don't they don't
4:54
heal the sick and cast that demons no all of our callings all of our callings
4:59
look different some of us will walk in higher levels of anointing and authority and deal with the higher level demons and be doing more Deliverance on a
5:05
regular basis than others but this is all of our callings the Bible says all
5:10
who believe these signs shall follow the lay hands on the sick they'll cast out demons Etc
5:18
okay so I'm not gonna put in my Instagram bio Deliverance minister
5:28
I don't really like to be called that I don't identify myself in that way I'm an apostle
5:34
I'm a believer of Jesus and that means I cast out demons
5:42
and I do more too I heal the sick I preach the gospel
5:49
raise the Dead
5:54
Hallelujah but but because the casting out of
6:00
demons is so rare and there's such a great massive need
6:08
then Deliverance is the big work that needs to be done
6:14
and even here even here if I will church or revivalist now everyone who needs Freedom flocks because there's so few
6:21
other places to find it but get it straight this is Oliver
6:27
colonies to cast out demons and we shouldn't we should never say oh
6:33
that's Deliverance Ministry oh that's casting out demons there I'm gonna go over here though because I
6:39
don't maybe want to hear demon scream or something I want to have my church service I'm
6:45
used to it's quiet or something I don't know you know but that should never be how we are
6:51
as Believers oh yeah that's Deliverance Ministry this is the ministry of Jesus
7:02
and Jesus when you read the gospels Jesus is doing so many miracles
7:08
and one of the biggest things he's doing is casting out demons
7:14
why because bringing demons is the devil's way of stealing killing and destroying
7:21
that's what he does it's simple he tries to steal kill and destroy he tries to steal people's Health steal
7:27
people's peace steal people's families steal people's lives
7:34
and he does this by bringing demons or bondage or oppression whatever you want
7:40
to call it but he sends demonic spirits
7:45
to to try to accomplish this and so the devil's real active and it's
7:50
very simple it's very simple most issues that people are having
7:59
better generational or an issue that someone has where they've tried many things and it's not
8:05
going away or an issue where they're praying they're fasting they're being the best Christian they can be but they
8:11
sit still there it's not going away uh issues where you go to a doctor they
8:16
don't know what's wrong with you issues where you prescribed medicine but you have to take the medicine your whole life it doesn't ever go away all of
8:23
these things simply our demonic spirits it's simple
8:30
so it's not like the movies the horror movies
8:35
where it's like this creepy possessed girl or something
8:41
and this is something really rare you don't usually walk around and see people looking possessed like you do in the horror movies right
8:47
but this is the devil's scheme to try to make it look like demons are rare
8:55
number one only the people looking really scary right turning their heads around or
9:01
something you know um number one uh and number two just that people would
9:08
be creeped out and that they would associate when they hear the word demon they would think of
9:13
horror movie when they think of when they hear Deliverance when they hear deliverance
9:19
from demons that they would think creepy scary weird instead of the most beautiful sight in the world
9:27
scheme of the devil scheme of the devil but I'm here to tell
9:33
you that Deliverance is beautiful
9:41
it is the most beautiful thing one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen in my life
9:49
because it's people who are who have been tortured by the Devil by demonic
9:55
spirits day in and day out for years many times in one second being rescued being freed
10:04
completely of that torture by Jesus by his love and Power
10:13
and the next second they literally feel freedom for the
10:18
first time they feel peace they feel Joy they feel the love of God
10:24
it's like seeing a person who was in jail
10:29
they were innocent but they were in jail not just jail but in a dungeon and tortured there in darkness in the pits
10:37
and seen Jesus go down there in the smelly cold dark place that he didn't
10:42
have to and take that person in bondage by the hand
10:47
and bring them out into the light into freedom
10:53
so beautiful it's so beautiful amen
11:00
it's people that are hearing the devil say to them you should kill yourself
11:05
every day several times and they even made a plan to kill themselves
11:10
they have a family who loves them so much they made this plan but then Jesus
11:16
phrase them and the plan is stopped and the voices
11:22
end and that person is saved and that person is walking in peace and joy in
11:27
the love of Jesus this is so beautiful so that's what I see whenever I see
11:35
someone throwing up coughing up spitting up I see
11:42
is tortured they've endured Darkness stuck inside of them
11:48
like chains binding them every single second of every day coming
11:53
out that is beautiful that's not gross
11:59
disgusting creepy that is beautiful
12:06
Darkness coming out and staying out
12:13
Hallelujah I could see that all day every day
12:20
when I hear a scream a shriek before it's even hurt my ears
12:26
the shriek I remember one person specifically one demon it was shocking it was like literally my ears were
12:32
ringing what is a beautiful sound to me nonetheless
12:37
beautiful because the Bible says that demons left
12:43
their victims with a loud shriek so that shriek is the most beautiful
12:49
sound ever because that's Darkness torment death leaving a person forever
13:00
Hallelujah that's the sound that's the look that's the sight and that's the
13:06
sound of the devil being defeated and under our feet
13:15
devil lost another one he's free she's free whoa
13:22
oh beautiful oh it's beautiful it's beautiful it's beautiful
13:29
and it's time that Deliverance it's revived
13:35
in the Church of today not just fivefold church not just four
13:43
five six Ministries in America or the whole world in the body of Christ today
13:52
because this is the ministry of Jesus if this if Deliverance is not revived by
13:59
and large in the body of Christ do you know what that means do you know that every every Church where Deliverance is
14:05
not allowed where anointing is not moving every Church
14:12
there is going to be at least one but probably most people sitting there stuck with demons
14:23
anxiety depression Suicidal Thoughts panic attacks addictions secret addictions
14:30
just constant strife and Division and rage and marriage constant nightmares
14:36
demons touching you in the Sleep these are all demonic spirits
14:41
and these are truly just so common in Christians today
14:47
yes Christians can have demons yes
14:53
demons cannot touch your spirit but your soul needs work if you open doors to say
14:59
that a Christian can't can't have demons is like saying that when you give your life to Jesus one must be completely
15:05
perfect that's that first day never sin another day in their life
15:10
they never open a door for any demon by accident or just because they're not perfected yet
15:17
is everyone perfect the first day they give their life to Jesus
15:23
right so doors open whether it's drinking doing a drug whether it's speaking death
15:30
over yourself whether it's as simple as the doctor saying a diagnosis and you saying oh I have cancer
15:37
I hope I don't die it's been in my family line so I was expecting this
15:51
is by when the doctor says that report you say I reject that the doctor may see that it might be
15:58
showing there but in the spiritual realm I'm already healed and I know the spiritual realm is more real than the
16:04
Physical Realm I know my authority in Christ I know this is a lie of the devil he wants me to believe that cancer is my
16:09
portion but cancer is not my portion Abundant Health is my portion Jesus Paid
16:15
the price for it so when that diagnosis comes how we're supposed to be I mean without sinning without speaking death
16:22
and with walking in Authority is to literally immediately you leave the doctor's office and say I reject that
16:28
diagnosis I declare any trace of cancer in my body must go I don't have cancer
16:36
by his stripes I am healed and I thank you Jesus for healing me
16:42
and you can say to family and friends you can say they diagnosed me with cancer but you don't say I have cancer
16:51
you can tell them the truth of what they're saying but you don't have to claim it and
16:56
that's what happens when you speak these things as simple as that is opening up a door
17:02
to a demon of infirmity of death so yes Christians can have demons
17:10
the demon does not touch your spirit your spirit your spirits where holy spirit is but in the soul can live demons if you
17:18
are a Christian and you take drugs and alcohol maybe you love God but you
17:23
haven't surrendered quite yet but you truly love God and you believe in Jesus as your savior and Lord you're a
17:29
Christian there are Christians who aren't surrendered yet and that was me till age 24 I was a Christian though and
17:35
I loved God and so you could be a Christian and be drinking and be doing drugs maybe you
17:41
had that addiction before you were saved and then this addiction's still there so if you are taking drugs if you are
17:47
taking alcohol as a Christian you are not protected from being addicted just because you're a Christian
17:54
addiction is a demonic spirit as simple as that
18:00
so you as Christians can have demons so when we don't when Deliverance is not accepted anointing is not in churches
18:06
today people are literally sitting there stuck with demons this is why Deliverance must be restored
18:13
to the body of Christ not just a couple Ministries it must be
18:18
restored it must be the norm and this is why as I've been sharing that in this
18:24
year we are going to see we are going to see this revival go mainstream global
18:34
where Deliverance is not a rare thing but God makes it clear makes it known this is me this is what I want for there
18:43
to be Deliverance in my church not just some who are called to it you are all
18:49
called to it so pastors leaders if you don't want to cast out demons then come join a church stop your church and come
18:56
join a church that will cast out demons if you want to cast out demons change your ways repent follow me and I'll pour
19:03
anointing on you if you're humble yourself and deliverance will break out in your church
19:10
but this is what we're gonna see happen remember I shared I I was sharing last week that God is purifying his bride now
19:19
so this means we're seeing Dr we're going to be seeing drastic change in the body of Christ
19:29
Hallelujah and for this to happen
19:35
we must do Deliverance right we must represent
19:40
Jesus rightly Deliverance isn't something that's like
19:46
brand new there's always been people operating in Deliverance and not all but there have been many who have either
19:54
missed revelation of how to properly walk in authority and cast out
20:00
demons or didn't carry the anointing and we're just trying to cast demons and
20:06
it was a mess because they don't have anointing so therefore Deliverance will not look
20:13
beautiful when it's done the wrong way when it's not done led by the Holy Spirit it will look chaotic it will look
20:20
ugly it will look confusing it will look freaky it will look scary
20:27
by that I mean it'll look like a a real fight with demons it should not look
20:32
like a fight with demons
20:40
that's where it looks freaky but when I see Jesus minister
20:46
oh it's just it's easy for him demons are nothing for him
20:52
when I see Apostle Peter Apostle Paul Minister it's easy because that anointing is so strong
20:59
there's not a struggle they're not yelling at the demon for three hours
21:04
they're not you know trying to get creative and try anything they can do maybe if we get more people to yell at
21:10
the same time of the team maybe the louder the voice we hear it'll scare the demon out
21:15
you know maybe if we put this object this physical thing on it maybe if we push the person down
21:26
that's not beautiful that's chaotic and and and the devil just loves that let me tell you because
21:33
it makes him like glorified like it makes him look strong and powerful
21:40
it's the anointing that destroys the yoke so when there's not true anointing or when there's not enough anointing
21:45
then um the Demonic power is greater
21:50
and so the devil makes it to look like he's more powerful
21:56
so many people have stayed away from Deliverance Ministry because of this reason or the the ministry of Deliverance because of this reason
22:03
intimidated scared just better not just I'll say over here
22:09
but now is a Revival and now God is has poured out his true
22:15
anointing and he has brought revelation
22:22
of how to release the anointing of how to walk in authority of how to defeat
22:29
these nasty demons every single time he's released it now he's continuing to
22:36
release it now so that it will look like how it did with Jesus
22:42
it will look like how it did in the acts Church Deliverance will look beautiful
22:48
I remember um one of the most beautiful sites that I saw that changed my life forever
22:56
was when I went to my spiritual father's Church in Tanzania East Africa and I visited a day where he was doing just a
23:04
Deliverance service and um at that point in my life I'd seen
23:09
a few demons cast out but only like one at a time not mass Deliverance so I hadn't seen a lot yet but there on
23:16
that day I I witnessed something that changed me forever and I witnessed
23:24
several people person after person demons manifest in them demon speaking
23:31
out of them and saying how they were trying to kill and destroy that person's life
23:37
I'll never forget one demon was saying there's I put I've been trying to kill
23:43
her by doing this by doing by this by doing this and most recently I I tried to kill
23:50
her by putting a rock in her throat and this lady had a rock a little stone stuck in her throat
23:56
not little it was like I don't you probably can't see it but like I don't know like a little smaller than a dime
24:02
Maybe not not quite half two thirds of a dime maybe so I'm seeing all of the these
24:08
demons speak the most evil things I've ever heard in my life
24:13
and and and when I witnessed that I was in awe of how evil the devil was I
24:19
never knew how evil the devil was until I could see with my own eyes
24:27
my spiritual eyes being opened this is how evil the devil is and then
24:34
in the next moment I see my spiritual father full of anointing just simply uh first of all be with be
24:41
so serious that I saw the love of God of like his his seriousness to free and heal his his
24:49
children I saw that like never before through him like this like you cannot mess with my
24:55
child he's mine She's Mine you nasty demon you must leave my child
25:04
like that's like the this like amazing love powerful love I never witnessed
25:09
before Powerful Love of Jesus I saw through my spiritual father and he just simply
25:15
commanded the demons to go it was quick it was just like one word gone
25:21
and and that one with a rock in the throat he commanded that that demon to come out
25:27
and that rock came out I saw the actual Rock come out
25:32
Hallelujah and so that date changed me forever it's one of
25:39
the most life-changing days in my life because for me to witness the to see how
25:44
evil the devil was it instantly number one gave me compassion and love
25:53
for people I never had before just seen
25:58
how how active the devil was in people's lives and and and seen how real how real
26:05
demons are how real this evil of the devil is just seeing that instantly made
26:10
me realize this is why that person was was mean to me this is why people burst
26:16
out in Rage this is why people do bad things and many times it's because they
26:22
are oppressed they are in Chains they are controlled to do these bad things by demons and they need freedom and they
26:30
need revelation of God's love to say free and and to live to please God
26:37
oh that Revelation hit me I didn't even have to sit down and meditate on it just like my eyes open up and on and
26:45
instantly I love people like never before I saw them with God's eyes like never
26:50
before so I thought the evil side like never before but then I saw the love of Jesus
26:57
like I never seen before and everything made sense to me like before I'm like why do bad things happen
27:04
to good people why do bad things happen to Christians you know you so many Christians feel that way but all of a
27:10
sudden all my questions were answered the devil's really at work
27:16
but Jesus sees he's alive and he wants to heal and deliver every single one of his people and he's doing it
27:23
but there's a way he works through vessels the vessels have to be trustworthy of anointing the
27:30
vessels have to be obedient there's a way he wants to do this and he's doing it but there's a way
27:36
we have to be it's up to us and so from that day I loved God like
27:41
never before I love people like never before and I had never I never had a
27:47
question anymore you know like God I don't understand why you would do this like that was never
27:53
there again because the way my spiritual eyes opened up
28:00
so I saw that day Deliverance is so beautiful God is bringing this now into
28:08
the body of Christ this this way of doing of delivering people which is his
28:13
way so that people can have these same experiences that I did so that they can look at the freedom
28:19
they can look at the Deliverance happening they can see wow this is Jesus
28:24
doing this he is powerful
28:30
oh this person renounced that this person had depression anxiety
28:37
this is spiritual this is a demonic spirit
28:42
and then oh look at the way they are free they were really free
28:47
that can't be faked look at the Joy on their face their tears they're screaming Hallelujah
28:54
they're jumping up and down I believe in Jesus now
29:00
I believe there's a devil I believe in Jesus and he's King over everything
29:05
like this kind of Revelation is Gonna Come to so many people in so fast
29:13
when we as a body of Christ demonstrate Deliverance demonstrate God's power
29:21
in this way that it's supposed to be done where there's order where there's Simplicity and not chaos and confusion
29:27
and when we can be vessels God can really entrust with anointing so that
29:32
there's no fight and struggle with the demons it's irresistible Hallelujah in Mark 1 21
29:42
um it says that they went to Capernaum and when the Sabbath came Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach the people
29:48
were amazed at his teaching because he taught them as one who had Authority not as the teachers of the law
29:54
just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure Spirit cried out what do you want with us Jesus of
30:00
Nazareth have you come to destroy us I Know Who You Are the Holy One Of God be quiet said Jesus
30:08
certainly come out of him the impure Spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek the people were
30:14
also amazed that they asked each other what is this a new teaching and with authority he even gives orders to impure
30:21
spirits and they obey him news about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee
30:30
as Deliverance is revived into the church Deliverance is to be displayed
30:36
for all to see for it to be public as deliver this is
30:41
how it needs to be as Deliverance is revived into the church it's not for some Churches
30:47
to take the demon oppressed to the back room
30:56
I never see Jesus doing that I never see in his presence as he's
31:01
ministering a demon manifest and Jesus said
31:07
wait here everybody just wait here I'm going to come back and preach come
31:13
we're going to find a private space here to cast out this demon Jesus
31:23
Jesus does not do that all of the times we're seeing Deliverance happen it's happening out in
31:30
the public Jesus came to minister to the masses Jesus came to
31:36
free everyone not just make it a uh something secluded that not many people
31:41
know about and and the way it works is he's anointed it's his anointing that
31:47
makes demons be exposed and be sent out it it's it's his anointing so he can't hide his anointing
31:55
and he doesn't want to hide his anointing it's like he wants to come and he wants to say every demon here must be exposed
32:03
because I'm here none of you can stay and you're going to be exposed and
32:08
you're going to be exposed for all to see so that people's eyes may open up to see
32:14
the reality of the spiritual Realm to realize this thing they're struggling with is spiritual and I'm the answer
32:20
Jesus I'm the one that can free them Jesus is saying this
32:26
so expose yourselves now and I'm gonna command you all to leave
32:33
now and as I commend you all to leave you will all leave and everyone will see the
32:40
glory of God everyone will see how power that Jesus is the only answer
32:46
he's the only answer he's the answer above all answers
32:51
he's the only one that brings us freedom that takes care of the root you can medicate you can counsel but it remains
32:58
only Jesus removes it only Jesus
33:04
this has to be seen this cannot be let me take you into the room
33:11
and then just Jesus and the person get to see the glory of God yeah he's free now yeah I'm free maybe a
33:18
couple will believe because they see their life life's different but not like the amount that would believe when they
33:24
say that demon be expelled before their eyes
33:34
so Jesus did not make Deliverance private ever and either did his apostles
33:42
did his ministers well for Peter we're seeing it says they
33:47
would bring the Second Amendment possessed they would bring them so that his shadow could pass by
33:52
it does not say they went into one room and they had an appointments with him one by one okay here's my shadow passing
33:59
by one of you no this was a public
34:06
so Deliverance must be displayed
34:12
and I must not remind you that Deliverance is beautiful it is not embarrassing to a single person I don't
34:19
care who thinks differently this is the truth it's not embarrassing this is what this
34:25
is the truth of what it is we come to church to receive from God every person that
34:31
comes to church the intention should be I need God I've come to receive him and I need him
34:39
I have struggles in my life I need Jesus that's what that's all of everyone's
34:46
reasoning to come to church should be okay that's why we're all here and so when
34:52
you come to church when a person comes to church they're coming saying I need God so then God says yes you do and I'm
34:59
gonna rescue you and so when a Deliverance is when it Deliverance is happening what's
35:07
the story that's being told with the Deliverance happening is that person needed God and God rescued them that
35:15
person did need God it was shown we all need God that person was freed from that
35:21
oppression from that sickness Hallelujah we don't need to be hiding that we need
35:28
God and those that don't want their Deliverance to be seen maybe it's
35:34
because they're not fully surrendered ready to say I need God
35:40
I'm not perfect I need God I need his help
35:47
but we're called to please God not people so there will be some people who aren't
35:52
surrendered there will be some people who aren't ready to say I need God but the Bible says seek God and when you
36:00
seek him with all your heart you will find him and so those who are in that place who maybe aren't even coming here
36:06
because they know they don't want to be seen being delivered Maybe it's up to them they gotta seek God
36:16
amen it's not for us to please them and like bypass the seeking God part God's
36:22
ways of people having free will and making people comfortable and then neglecting God's glory
36:30
neglecting people's eyes being opened up to see how real and powerful and
36:36
Beautiful Jesus is we have that responsibility
36:42
to display God's wonders to this is how he gets the glory
36:50
when Deliverance can be seen and you see that there's no way a human can do that
36:55
when you see the supernatural behind it
37:01
that's how he gets the glory amen also number one we don't want to hide God's glory we want people to be see we want
37:08
people to see Jesus is a deliverer he can deliver you to and the way that's seen is by it being shown this is the
37:14
Bible today we're called to be like the Bible today the Bible continued like um
37:20
Mary Magdalene thank God she didn't demand the authors of the Bible in the gospels to withhold her story
37:28
because she was embarrassed that she was once a time oppressed and she needed God she needed Jesus
37:34
I'm so grateful that she was proud
37:40
to show I needed Jesus and Jesus freed me I once was lost and now I'm found I once
37:46
was oppressed now I'm free and I'm a disciple of Jesus this can happen for
37:51
you too every person who reads a Bible in the future I'm so glad she didn't have her name
37:58
changed or something well let's change her name to protect your privacy
38:05
you know it's all for God's glory it's meant to be shown and be proud of our Jesus
38:12
it's meant for us to to Humble ourselves yes I needed God yes I was bound
38:18
that's what being a child of God means humble servant caring for other people to
38:24
receive what you've received and secondly
38:32
we have to show the power of God we have to display it we have to stream it we have to post
38:39
videos because people are being delivered by by videos
38:44
through the videos people are being healed people are coming to find Jesus
38:50
people are being receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit by watching the
38:55
videos by watching the videos of other people being free last week there was a
39:01
beautiful uh couple who was delivered here do you remember that there was a couple specifically last
39:08
week I don't know if they're here today but they were delivered and then the it was so beautiful the woman she was
39:14
baptized in the Holy Spirit right after she was delivered and I posted a video of it a clip of it like a four minute
39:20
clip earlier this week I'm gonna share a testimony with you
39:25
and this is one of uncountable testimonies like this that we get every single week every day but pretty much
39:31
okay I'm gonna read this testimony that came in last night so it's on this video of this couple
39:37
being delivered this person says I legit began to manifest watching this video
39:43
and started shaking viciously the demons left me after you renounce the spirits of depression and anxiety on the young
39:49
woman I've they left her Hallelujah I've been having a lot of spiritual
39:55
warfare lately and watching this freed me seeing the young woman anointed by the Holy Spirit also brought me to tears
40:01
such a beautiful Ministry and I didn't even attend in person God just put it on my screen and I'm also at work right now
40:18
God's power is moving everywhere
40:26
but if we were like caring what people think and thinking and caring about what
40:32
people think over what God thinks and we didn't put these videos out she would still be in bondage right now
40:40
you see how important this is people are literally being delivered and
40:47
encountering God's power through every one of these videos
40:52
I think that's more important than caring what people think
40:59
of how you look isn't it that God can get the glory that people's
41:05
eyes can open up to see God is real God is more powerful than the devil and that they can be free
41:11
and people can even receive Deliverance they have the same demons you had and
41:16
when those words were spoken anxiety depression go that same demon of depression anxiety has to go from the
41:22
person watching across the world that's how it works that's how Authority works
41:31
so this is so important for deliverance to be public and displayed so the most
41:37
people possible can be freed and encounter God's power
41:44
in the times of Jesus if Jesus is same today as yesterday I'm sure in the times of Jesus that there were many demons
41:50
leaving when he was addressing one demon because that's what he's doing today
41:55
amen next the Deliverance Ministry must be revived in the body of Christ because it
42:02
is the greatest one of the greatest tools to attract people to Jesus people
42:08
desperately need freedom they're desperate in the world they are
42:15
desperate Christians non-christians they are desperate they are looking they are searching they are Googling and they're
42:21
finding witches and psychics but they're not finding Jesus Christian Church Deliverance happening you have addiction
42:29
you can be freed come to the search they're not see they haven't been seeing
42:35
that but they see witches offering that psychics offering that
42:41
so they go there it's not like they're um evil people looking to do witchcraft they're
42:48
desperate and looking for help we are called to be the help for people
42:56
the answer we have to let people know
43:02
Hallelujah
43:09
the greatest scheme of the enemy to try to stop people from Saved
43:15
to try to stop people from being safe from getting saved is to
43:20
make the church Christians think we do not need the fullness of the Holy Spirit
43:30
the greatest tool evangelism tool the greatest tool to see people attracted to
43:36
the church attracted to your events your churches so you can tell people about Jesus and see them be saved the greatest
43:43
tool is for the Holy Spirit to be fully Alive
43:49
in you not neglecting the Holy Spirit who cast
43:55
out demons but allowing him to come in you fully
44:01
and being proud of him a proud of Jesus a deliverer
44:08
it is Jesus who attracts people Jesus in his fullness and when we are withholding so much of him people aren't attracted
44:14
because we're not really showing them Jesus we're showing we're telling them words
44:19
but we're not showing them power we're not showing them action and so for so long like the generation
44:26
we've been living in you know like I remember when I was in high school and when I was in college and I was constantly
44:33
um interacting with people in the world you know you could just see the way they they saw
44:39
Christianity was like just another religion no that's how they saw it
44:46
and so people today people in the world most times the thing that kind of makes them go sometimes is like oh I feel like
44:53
being more spiritual I think I'll try out this religion here let me go to this church
44:59
and that's the that's like what we're attracting right now not we here but that's what the body of
45:05
Christ by and large has been attracting now when Jesus came for the lost the
45:10
desperate the oppressed he came to say I can help you I want to
45:18
free you you're in bondage I can free you I can heal you he didn't say everyone should believe in me and if you
45:25
believe in me then you will get to the reward but when but when we see Jesus Minister
45:32
he's showing who he is first he's showing his love
45:38
this is how you he was demonstrating his love he saw people the thing they wanted more than anything in the world was to
45:43
not be suffering with this demon anymore this demon of Suicidal Thoughts mental
45:48
torment depression anxiety he he would touch them the most is for them to be free of that and he has the power to do
45:55
that and he loves them and doesn't want them to be tortured anymore so he says Be Free
46:03
come to me follow me and you walk in this Freedom that you've
46:08
just experienced now that'll stay in you and you'll walk in Abundant Life come
46:14
that's that's what Jesus was doing in the Gospels that's what we need to be doing
46:22
the church should be known as the place to receive freedom the place to receive healing
46:30
not another religion where there's judgment
46:37
and it's boring no
46:43
but we need we need this ministry of Deliverance to be revived in the church and people will start hearing about it
46:51
oh have you heard about that church like people are being freed and healed there
46:58
of all sorts of things have you heard of the Hat and and and so we become the most
47:04
amazing Witnesses when we are free and when our eyes are opened when we're where the power of God is and
47:11
when we've been delivered and our eyes can see the reality of the spiritual realm and we're walking in Abundant Life
47:17
that's how we are the greatest Witnesses you shine and you radiate Jesus and you
47:24
are full of his love and you were overflowing with love and and when you see people you genuinely love them and
47:30
you genuinely want them to know Jesus and you genuinely want them to be freed and healed
47:38
it's pure it's genuine and people can see that and sense that
47:43
and so when you're interacting with people when you strike when when they're when you're having conversations with people they sense that
47:50
and there's that's Jesus there's sensing and it's so attractive there's nothing more attractive than the real Jesus
47:57
and they taste that through you and they're attracted they're attracted
48:03
to ask more questions they're attracted to maybe eventually um receive prayer from you or come to
48:09
church with you and check it out what made you be this amazing way
48:15
versus Witnesses Christians
48:21
without the holy spirit fulling in their lives without freedom without Abundant
48:26
Life they're walking in with religion I saw people on the way here I saw them
48:34
just give your life to Jesus something like
48:39
this and I would just instantly I just felt like it that the
48:46
motivation is like I'm gonna go to hell if I don't do this
48:51
and even also and then when you're when you're in that religion you yourself are judging too like how can you not believe
48:57
in Jesus you're evil you need to Revenge every life to Jesus
49:02
you sinner who wants that who is attracted to that I'm not attracted to that and I'm a Believer
49:08
like it's true right but I'm not sure that's not Jesus that's not Jesus that's
49:14
like that's the opposite of Jesus that's judging condemnation Strife religion hate
49:21
that's not Jesus right and so for so long the world has not been attracted to come to church it's not been attracted
49:27
to Christianity and Jesus right but
49:33
when we are really full with his love because we've been where his power is we've received his power we've been set
49:38
free we're walking in Abundant Life we become so attracted attract to people the love you'll be so
49:45
surprised the people that will come to Jesus through you you'll be surprised the biggest atheist
49:51
that you know super worldly people you'll be surprised that people that become saved and set
49:56
free here in this church we're in Hollywood for a reason amen
50:01
in the Hollywood area because God loves everybody the nameless to the famous he loves everyone he wants
50:07
everyone saved so we're going to see that happen in this revival
50:12
I was um reflecting on Billy Graham and like Billy Graham we haven't seen this in our day we haven't seen
50:19
a minister or Ministry like that big scale you know and things were so
50:26
different back then like because there was just favor upon him and that I
50:32
mean God was upon him just masses were coming stadiums being filled and there
50:39
was this attraction of even people from the world you know like so many leaders world leaders he would meet with
50:45
going to such I remember I forget the certain countries I remember reading a book like hearing about
50:51
certain countries that are like very atheists and everything but there was just so much like respect and curiosity
50:58
right because there was this attraction coming from him that was God
51:04
attracting people that you would never expect right I went to um here in La you can visit uh Amy's
51:11
McPherson's parsonage where she lived for a Time and those of you don't know her she was
51:16
a big uh revivalist she walked in God's power so many were healed in LA in the
51:22
like 1920s 30s time and she had her own church she opened her church doors on
51:28
January 1st 1923 100 years to the day of when our new building became our new
51:33
building yeah Hallelujah and it was so interesting like going
51:39
into that parsonage and hearing the history um they had to in La they had to like
51:46
add more buses to their schedule for Sunday services for her Sunday Services because of her Sunday services
51:53
um and I mean there was just so many thousands that would come to that church here in L.A and
51:59
it even said that on one Sunday hundreds of actors would come to her service
52:06
on one Sunday white thing is that like at least 100 would come and so I'm just like I'm
52:13
reflecting on like on her on Billy Graham and I'm seeing just something so different that we haven't seen in our
52:19
time where people of the world where people in Hollywood were people that we never see them being attracted to God you know
52:26
nowadays hardly ever God in in this revival and his favor he's putting on it
52:31
it becomes so irresistible Jesus becomes so irresistible Jesus
52:37
becomes so famous that people are at least curious they at
52:42
least have to come come and see they've heard too many testimonies of people being delivered of the same oppression
52:48
they have they've heard too many testimonies now their friends are coming and telling
52:53
them they have to come and check it out now
52:59
this is what God's about to do
53:05
and this is why Deliverance the power of God must be revived in the body of Christ because this is what's going to
53:11
bring the the people of the world who are not attracted to Christianity today
53:17
they're going to be attracted Hallelujah First Corinthians 2 verse 4 says my
53:23
message and my preaching we're not with wise and persuasive words but with a demonstration of the spirit's power
53:29
so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom but on God's power
53:39
God is calling us to demonstrate his power to cast out demons
53:44
so that people may actually believe in him
53:49
the real him where nothing is impossible for him all-powerful Jesus who does any kind of
53:57
miracle all-powerful Jesus who can free you and heal you of anything for people
54:03
to get to know and believe in this Jesus the only Jesus the only true Jesus we
54:09
have to demonstrate his power to people I came to you not with wise and
54:15
persuasive words I came to you not just saying Jesus can deliver you if you feel demonic oppression we're going to go to
54:23
a private room I love that we're in a park that's not God's like that's not even an option
54:28
I'm really making it like it has to be public it has to be demonstrated you know God God got at it all taken care of
54:37
you know but there will not be Jesus can deliver you and deliverance is happening now if you
54:44
feel the Demonic oppression we're gonna go in the room none of that the power must be demonstrated
54:51
so that people's eyes may open up to God's amazing love to his power to the reality of the spiritual Realm so they
54:58
can believe this is how so much faith is going to be released when others are they see it being set free
55:05
this is really happening here Jesus is really here Among Us
55:11
I just saw in my own eyes Jesus free somebody I believe now I have faith I had now
55:18
that I didn't before that he can free me today too Hallelujah
55:24
we need to be bold now
55:30
bold and unashamed to demonstrate God's power
55:37
I'm so proud of you here in faithful Church who rejoice in the freedom that takes place here
55:43
I'm proud of you God's truly brought beautiful hearts here that sees the true beauty and
55:49
freedom you are leaders as you help people to see the beauty to help people see
55:56
that God is worthy to be praised for every Miracle he does worthy to jump up and down and phrase
56:03
them and to show that this is the most beautiful thing in the world to be in
56:08
God's presence to encounter him to see others free and healed
56:13
Hallelujah so it's time to be bold to not cower down
56:21
to not care what people think of course there's going to be people there with different opinions of course there will
56:26
be people there who don't get it who don't understand who think Deliverance is weird and strange and fake of course
56:33
the people say it's actors there's all of that out there okay but we have to
56:38
choose to fear God and not man Paul says I would not be a servant of
56:44
God if I look for the approval of men and women so God's calling you to be true Servants
56:50
of God and to be bold and unashamed and proud of our Jesus who sets the captives
56:56
free
57:03
to share every video possible to not care what anybody thinks to spread your
57:10
testimony far and wide as possible and to live your life looking at people
57:16
who need Freedom having a heart for them having a heart for them and living your
57:22
lives that way letting them know Jesus can free you serving the work of God here
57:29
helping the work of God to go forth so more people can be free amen
57:35
Hallelujah Deliverance is being revived in the body of Christ
57:41
Hallelujah not just here not just a Bible Church
57:46
not just in L.A but all over the world it's been revived now
