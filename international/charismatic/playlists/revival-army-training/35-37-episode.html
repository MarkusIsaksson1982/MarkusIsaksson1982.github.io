the word of God today is following the shepherd's voice John 10:27 says the sheep that are
0:08
my own hear my voice and listen to me I know them and they follow
0:16
me the sheep that are my own hear my voice and listen to me I know them and
0:25
they follow me this is the scripture that the
0:31
message is based on today this scripture has a couple
0:37
meanings and the first is God is our
0:44
shepherd shepherd of all Shepherds king of all Kings Lord of all Lords Shepherd
0:49
of all Shepherds and we are his sheep and so we know his
0:57
voice when you believe in Jesus when you give your life to
1:03
Jesus his Spirit comes and lives inside of you and he gives you the ability to hear
1:11
his voice he doesn't make it difficult to hear his voice he does however come in a
1:19
still Small Voice the majority of the time and the Bible says when you seek me and seek me with all of your heart then
1:25
you will find me so he doesn't make it difficult difficult to find him and hear his voice
1:32
but you can't be lazy you have to seek him you have to
1:37
want to hear his voice you have to go after his voice which means many things like
1:44
prayer reading the word being planted where God's calling
1:49
you to be planted to hear the the word coming through a lead an anointed leader
1:55
of God like that's what you're doing today that's a form of seeking God and
2:01
seeking his voice so when you do these things when you're seeking after him seeking to hear
2:08
him he doesn't hide himself he doesn't make it hard to hear him you will hear him maybe sometimes you want to be
2:15
hearing more maybe sometimes you want to hear a lot of more chitchat like how you chitchat with
2:22
friends when he maybe is speaking more simply but still he is speaking
2:30
so when you become a true sheep of God meaning you are a true child of God
2:37
meaning you are surrendered then you will know his voice and you will hear
2:42
his voice so therefore you won't get lost you'll be a sheep that stays
2:49
found because you you recognize your father's voice the shepherd's voice and
2:54
you know the difference between the shepherd's voice and other voices that will will be around there will be a lot
3:01
of voices around always a lot of options of what to listen to but because you're
3:08
surrendered you know what the voice of God sounds like and you choose to only follow his
3:15
voice
3:23
amen God's voice the shepherd's voice is not ever condemning there is therefore
3:29
no condemnation in Christ Jesus so you you have to read the word
3:35
of God to understand what his voice sounds like like I just read a scripture
3:40
from the word a foundational scripture there is therefore no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus meaning
3:47
when you surrender to God you are in Christ Jesus he is not going to be condemning you he'll speak with lovingly
3:55
conviction he may speak sharply and seriously
4:00
but it's with love and with no
4:06
condemnation the shepherd's voice God's voice does not go against his word and
4:14
his principles the principles in his word meaning Revelation from the Holy Spirit
4:21
coming upon his word revealing what these principles are laws in the spiritual Realm
4:30
like the the ways that he chooses to move and work the the the principles of
4:36
his kingdom so he doesn't go against his word or his principles yet he is not
4:44
confined to a box and he moves in new
4:51
ways so you have to know this part about the shepherd's voice to be able to hear
4:57
him speaking amen that means you have to be free of
5:03
religion of old win skin Doctrine old wine Doctrine like what the Pharisees
5:11
had also the shepherd's voice doesn't go against his
5:18
order for example his order in the church how he
5:24
has order in his church how he has structure how he has the five-fold
5:29
Ministry how he has a way of equipping and leading his
5:35
body and releasing impartation to his body he won't go against his
5:41
order amen when God's when when God speaks to
5:49
you when you hear his voice you cannot deny it when you really know his
5:56
voice and there can be a lot of people saying thus says the Lord there can be a
6:03
lot of people saying God told me this there can be a lot of people saying God is saying that you should do
6:12
this or God is saying that you shouldn't do this there will be a lot of voices
6:19
telling you that throughout the course of your life some Seasons it can be a
6:25
whole lot more especially when you're going against the grain and you're being
6:30
a Pioneer for Jesus and you're accepting him coming in a new way that many are
6:36
not that's when you're going to hear a lot of voices saying God's saying you should or shouldn't do this but just
6:44
because there's a voice saying God told me this for your life does not mean it's
6:49
the shepherd's voice
6:55
amen even family members even even your your parents that love you that have
7:03
been nothing but pure love to you your whole life sometimes in some situations
7:09
they can be saying God saying you shouldn't do that but the shepherd told you
7:16
differently so Matthew 10:34 it says in the passion translation
7:22
perhaps you think I've come to spread peace and come over the Earth that's Jesus talking but my coming will bring
7:29
conf conflict and division not peace because of me a son will turn against his father a daughter her mother and
7:36
against her mother-in-law within your own family families you will find enemies whoever loves father or mother
7:42
or son or daughter more than me is not fit to be my disciple and the meaning of
7:47
that is there will be a lot of people and sometimes in your own family saying God's saying this when it's not
7:55
God when it's the devil masquerading as an angel of Light when it's one's own
8:00
emotions when it's the religious spirit like the Pharisees had saying God's saying this about Jesus but they were
8:09
wrong these type of things can happen with friends and family maybe they never
8:15
even happen before and all of a sudden this starts to happen where people close to you were saying God's saying this for
8:21
your life but the shepherd is not saying that and so that's the meaning of the
8:28
scripture is that there can be times where maybe you're surrendered to Jesus
8:33
but other family members and friends are not maybe they're not even not even a
8:40
believer or maybe they are a Believer but not all the way surrendered and when that takes when that happens there's
8:46
going to be division there's going to be somebody saying God told me this and
8:52
then you who are surrendered knows the Shepherd saying something
8:58
different see you you got to make sure you know what the shepherd's voice is and you have to be aware that there will
9:04
be other people speaking God said this but it's not the shepherd's
9:11
voice so I want to go back to what I shared of about the shepherd's voice how
9:17
he doesn't go against his order in his
9:22
church so God's order in his church looks like this it says in Ephesians
9:30
411 that Jesus when he poured out his Spirit upon the church he gave gifts to
9:35
the body of Christ and these gifts were Apostles and Prophets and evangelists and pastors and teachers and the purpose
9:42
of these gifts was to equip the Believers so that they would no longer be immature like babies but they would
9:51
be equipped and grow strong to be mature vessels of God who would be victorious
9:58
over the enemy live victoriously as a Believer and then step two that they
10:03
could be a powerful vessel of God who could help others who could disciple
10:09
others and equip others amen and so that's that's God's
10:15
order of building up his body equipping his body speaking to his body feeding
10:23
his body is the church it's a fful Ministry is leadership ship of five-fold
10:30
ministry so God he will anoint a leader like how he anointed Peter he will
10:37
anoint a leader today and he will he will anoint them to be a leader of a of
10:44
his church and he will give that leader a specific Vision it's God's Vision he's
10:50
giving to them an assignment saying I want you to accomplish this for me and
10:57
I'm going to bring many people to to help you accomplish my vision and
11:02
assignment that I've given you and therefore have given all the people that I bring to come under you and help you
11:10
who will grow under you so that you all are doing this work
11:16
together amen but that's God's system he releases the vision and assignment to the
11:24
leader not not not like to all the people he rings at the same time
11:30
simultaneously he releases it to the leader and then the leader shares the
11:36
vision so the vision is with the leader GI entrusted by
11:41
God Amen Hallelujah and so for
11:46
example well I'll say I'll say this God God has many different works
11:53
that he wants to be doing across the world and so different churches will
11:58
have different assignments different Visions so here at fivefold church we
12:06
have a specific vision and assignment and to summarize it God has
12:14
called us to partner with him in helping
12:19
to restore what we are seeing that's missing in the acts Church to the church
12:26
today God is calling us to say yes to him in
12:35
his move in his end time Revival of purifying his bride of transforming his
12:41
bride so our job is not to have the same vision of other churches and do church
12:46
as normal church as others Church do church but we are to say whatever you
12:54
want to do Lord and God is saying this well I want to restore my anointing my
13:00
power my people must be free so we say Okay Lord pour your
13:08
anointing upon us and we recognize that comes of persecution but we don't care all we care about is doing what you want
13:15
us to do God we want people to be free too because that's what you want
13:23
Hallelujah and so God's saying I want my five-fold Ministry that we see in the
13:28
book of Acts that we see in the New Testament Church that we don't see today we only see a part we don't see the
13:34
foundation we don't see Apostles and Prophets God saying I want my Apostles and Prophets restored because this is
13:41
how the body will be fully equipped and and be fed the proper spiritual
13:47
nutrients when we have the equipping of the Apostles and the prophets so I want
13:55
Apostles and Prophets I want the apostolic and prophetic minist restored in the
14:01
church so we say yes Lord we will be unashamed to say that
14:08
Apostles exist today prophets exist today we will be unashamed of those
14:13
words we won't cower down and be shy and say only Apostolic we will say
14:20
the word Apostle you know yes Lord this is the vision he's given to us we will follow
14:27
you Lord we will do this Hallelujah and so
14:34
um with accepting this we become I mean this this trans this this is this comes
14:41
out in the teaching this comes out in the ministry and this becomes an example to the body of Christ around the world
14:48
and it becomes a flame that spreads like a wildfire it's a very important Vision assignment that God has given us that's
14:56
changing the world glory to God where God's able to accomplish what he wants to
15:02
accomplish that means that there will be an emphasis here in this church on these
15:08
areas that are missing presently in the body of Christ amen it means there's going to be
15:16
an emphasis on the power of God and the anointing and the walking in authority
15:21
of Christ and and and and on proper order in the church proper structure in the
15:27
church the five-fold Ministry there's going to be an emphasis on the apostolic and the prophetic Ministries the
15:34
Evangelist and pastoral and teaching Ministries are importantance and the other works of God and themes of God and
15:40
and different um topics in the word of God are all so important but God's
15:46
called us to have an emphasis on these on these things here on these areas here that's that's
15:54
the vision praise God hallelujah
16:01
and so it's very important to humble yourself and come to where God's calling
16:07
you to be knowing that you are here to learn the vision not come with your
16:15
own and try to bring your vision and mix it with a vision that's already here you
16:21
have to be humble and be a disciple be one who learns and and and surrenders you your
16:29
vision for the sake of what Jesus wants to do
16:36
amen hallelujah 1 Corinthians
16:43
4:15 for even if you had 10,000 others to teach you about Christ you have only
16:48
one spiritual Father for I became your father in Christ Jesus when I preached the good news to you so I urge you to
16:54
imitate me so Paul is speaking this this is New
17:01
Testament Church this is what we're getting back to in these areas that we've neglected this is New Testament
17:07
Church this is Paul speaking this he's saying though you have listened to many teachers on the
17:15
YouTube and many different churches on the Tik Tock I sound older than I am why am I
17:21
saying the YouTube I don't know on YouTube and Tik Tok and Instagram and
17:27
Facebook um though you have listened to many
17:33
different teachings and though you have gone to many different churches though you've acquired all of these kinds of
17:39
teachings but all of those teachers are not your father or mother Are Not Your
17:45
Leader are not your Shepherd that brings me to my next the
17:51
next uh meaning of the scripture we know the shepherd's voice
17:58
we listen to the Shepherd's voice this scripture is speaking of God being The Shepherd of all Shepherds but also in
18:05
the word of God Pastor is referred to as Shepherd in the New Testament many
18:13
times the word Shepherd is used instead of Pastor actually and it means
18:18
pastor and so the leader of your church is your pastor sometimes it's an apostle
18:24
like me who's operating also in the Pastoral gifting and as pastor
18:30
so I am your Shepherd here in this church amen Your
18:36
Leader so Paul is saying you have had many people teach you but they're not
18:41
all your Shepherds you can only have one Shepherd one Shepherd in terms of on this Earth as a spiritual leader and
18:48
then we have God as our Shepherd of all Shepherds but you can only have one spiritual father or spiritual mother so
18:54
your spiritual father or your spiritual mother is also your Shepherd
18:59
is also your leader spiritual leader in the Lord amen that God assigns you to
19:06
and God calls you to submit under and receive and so it's very important for
19:12
you to realize like when when God has called you somewhere when you feel in your spirit when you hear the shepherd
19:19
his voice saying come and plant yourself here in this church in this
19:25
ministry it's important for you to realize you're not here by accident you're not here just because it's
19:31
exciting for you to see the power of God or something but you are here because God's called you to the same vision and
19:38
assignment as the leader of that Ministry
19:44
amen and so it's going to look different how that Vision comes to life in your
19:52
life uh that vision is we can also call your calling your calling your purpose
19:59
on this Earth many people think their purpose is to be a singer an actor a teacher a doctor a lawyer that's not
20:05
your purpose that's not your calling your calling is greater your calling has to do with the kingdom of God and
20:10
bringing Souls into the kingdom and being a vessel of God so he can do what he wants through you to touch
20:17
people and so in the workplace as you're a teacher
20:23
these things may take place that's your calling yes but it's not your calling to be a teacher it's
20:29
calling it's your calling to be a vessel of God to say yes to his vision and do his vision and
20:36
assignment which it's much bigger than just like a teacher teaching it's
20:42
bringing his kingdom Hallelujah so so for some of you it can
20:50
look like this how you how you're H how you find your calling how you fulfill
20:55
your calling here and make the vision go forth that's here at F Church make the
21:00
vision go forth for some of you it can be in the workplace in the workplace you
21:06
share with people about your faith in Jesus and your testimony and how God's freed you and you share with them God
21:12
can free you too and then the person gets set free because in your workplace you are sharing your
21:18
testimony and that's aligning exactly with this Vision that's here in this
21:24
house in this church amen for some of you it could it could go even further
21:30
you tell somebody about how your life's been have your lives Been Changed by Jesus and you you invite them to church
21:37
and they come here and then they find their calling here maybe they're called to be an apostle here or an apostle of
21:43
Jesus a prophet evangelist pastor and teacher and so you walking in your calling has done so so many big things
21:51
that's transcending to so many other people that have been reached by just you in your workplace being a vessel of
21:58
God and following the vision or a amen and and for some of you
22:03
here some of you are called to be Apostles some of you are called to be prophets some of you are called to be evangelists some of you are called to be pastors some of you are called to be
22:09
teachers and so you come here and God will anoint you here in his timing and that that will be your
22:16
purpose and your calling is releasing his anointing his his word in the office
22:22
of a fold Ministry Office so many different areas um so many different things will happen for all of you you
22:28
but it's not just in general your just being like a vessel of God but it's it
22:36
has to be in line with the specific Vision that God's given you which is never going to be a loner Vision it's
22:43
going to be part of a body hallelujah
22:53
amen so as a shepherd
22:58
Shepherds um in the in the world uh in the church on this Earth
23:05
Shepherds they have responsibility over your spiritual health and
23:13
protection that's their job that's their responsibility they will give I will
23:19
give we will give those of us that are Shepherds on this Earth we will give an account to
23:24
God for your for your protection and your spiritual health and grow
23:31
but the person sitting next to you will not be responsible for your spiritual health and
23:37
protection and will not have to give an account to God about your spiritual health and
23:43
protection the the people in the congregation the Sheep that's that's not
23:48
their responsibility that's on the
23:54
shepherd just giving you an Insight of what it's of what the Shepherd has to do
23:59
of the role of a Shepherd it's not just getting up here and preaching and praying for
24:04
people it's something that's taken very seriously and Only You Can Be anointed
24:10
for this and when God's anointed you for this there's a Grace that comes upon you
24:16
and God will be speaking to you things there's wolves here this is what to do in this situation take care of the wolf
24:22
and protect the Sheep by preaching by taking action
24:29
Hallelujah but God won't be speaking that to people who aren't the shepherd people in the
24:42
church also myself and all Shepherds we are
24:47
responsible for for giving Pure Food
24:53
pure new wine pure Doctrine to you
25:01
and that's also something that you have to be anointed for like God has to take you
25:08
higher like re reveal more to you so you can be a teacher to give to others and
25:13
not be on the same level that wouldn't be of help to you that's sometimes how like the Bible studies where you're um
25:21
just sharing you're just all going around a circle and sharing that's something to be aware of like this isn't
25:27
really maybe a Time specifically to be fed you know there's a specific Grace
25:33
that comes upon your Shepherd to feed
25:38
you to feed you 100% pure wine pure
25:44
Doctrine I also want to say you know Paul said um I'm I'm your only father in
25:50
the Lord spiritual father and he said imitate me as I imitate
25:56
Christ and I shared this recently the past past couple Sundays I
26:02
believe I've shared this but it is rare today because of faults in the church by
26:08
you know missing so many important parts that we see in the acts church because
26:13
there's faults and not wholeness and there is not complete Purity by and
26:19
large in the body of Christ because of that there has been it has it is
26:25
impacted in the leadership in many areas and so people find they can't fully trust leaders many times people can be
26:32
listening with a a skeptical ear you know and not putting full trust
26:38
there but Paul said imitate me as I imitate Christ with Paul we don't see
26:44
him once he was saved and his eyes opened up we don't see him falling we don't see scandals we don't see him see
26:51
him being untr untrustworthy in any way and so now we can see this is what God
26:56
wants and this is God's way like this is his way of of protecting and feeding his
27:03
sheep his church is by raising up and anointing a pure and humble
27:10
leader that can really walk by the spirit and will not open up doors and
27:17
have compromise but can be pure like how Paul was pure and so for for for by the leading
27:25
of the holy spirit for Paul to say imitate me as I imitate Christ that meant like for God to for God to
27:31
want him to say that that meant he could be trusted he could be
27:37
imitated like fully like there wasn't an area that was like oh well not that part
27:42
you know he could be trusted so this is the kind of Grace
27:49
that God puts on a leader this is what God's doing now this is how it's changing now the body of
27:55
Christ where we can trust true anointed leaders of God and you'll know them by the fruits you know you know them by the
28:02
fruits and then God calls you there and he convicts you I can this is where I want you you can trust here you can rest
28:08
here so at that time we need to now follow these biblical principles that Paul lays out you only have one father
28:16
in the Lord spiritual father and imitate me as I imitate
28:21
Christ so you're you're seeing now how that is the voice that you should be listening to that's the shepherd's voice
28:28
in terms of a spiritual leader that's where it can be trusted that's where it can be
28:35
pure amen so Shepherds we also have this job
28:41
of releasing pure Doctrine pure gospel no
28:49
religion not like a tad of what the Pharisees had mixed in no pure new wine
28:58
pure gospel we have that
29:04
responsibility we have the responsibility to feed that to you to release that to you and at the same time
29:12
we as Shepherds have the responsibility of protecting you from old wine wrong
29:20
doctrine that may be seeping in on in the ground through the walls on the
29:27
ceiling while you're in the church and outside listening to other
29:34
voices and things but especially in the house we have that
29:40
responsibility and so what does that look like that looks like bringing equipping and teaching to you teaching
29:47
you of how to make sure you don't listen to the wrong
29:53
voices even if there's old wine floating around in this room or something wrong Doctrine
30:01
floating around I mean everybody's welcome here amen everybody's welcome we
30:06
let anybody come in we don't give them an interview we don't say are you a hater
30:13
or or not you know like can we trust you are you going to be quiet you going to
30:19
start shouting something no the doors are
30:25
open but that also means you you got to be innocent as a dove and wise as a
30:33
serpent even in the house of God and in your life among the body and your family
30:41
in Christ you got to be wise as a serpent by that I mean
30:47
remember to not be listening to wrong
30:52
voices remember the voice you're supposed to be listening to the Shepherds
31:04
Hallelujah so I have a job to equip you to be Discerning and to not listen to the wrong voices 2 Corinthians
31:12
11:14 no wonder since Satan himself masquerades as an angel of
31:22
Light 2 Corinthians 11:4 says for you seem willing to allow it if one comes
31:27
com and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive a different Spirit from the one you
31:33
received or a different gospel from the one you accepted you tolerate all of this beautifully welcoming the
31:43
deception so Paul is speaking this to his disciples to his
31:48
sheep and he's noticing that people are listening to other
31:54
voices when they're supposed to be just listening to the shepherd to what Paul taught he's like I taught you the true
32:02
pure gospel but you seem to have itching
32:07
ears when you have itching ears you're not being a true sheep that's another
32:13
meaning in general of my sheep know my voice and they
32:18
listen to me if you have itching ears and you only want to listen to God when
32:24
it's comfortable for you or on certain topics that you like but when it comes to other things you don't want to listen
32:30
you're not being a true sheep you're having itchy ears and you're not listening to the
32:38
shepherd amen so Paul is talking so so so if Paul's having this
32:45
issue with his disciples then that means that today that issue can spring
32:51
up so we have to be aware of this we have to be aware and careful that we are not like
32:57
these disciples that Paul's talking about don't have those itching ears and
33:02
and remember where to listen to The Voice and not to be listening to the wrong voices uh and and it says the devil can
33:11
masquerade himself as an angel of Light and um this can be referring to
33:17
false Apostles false prophets but this can this can refer to so many things
33:23
like even even like someone who seems to have such a great heart and they do have a
33:29
great heart but maybe they're just deceived in a certain area and they they're holding or maybe
33:36
they just have old win skin in them still and so the enemy can see that and
33:42
he can use that doesn't mean that the person is some evil person that's
33:48
letting themselves be used by the devil if we're not careful the devil can use you
33:57
when you have a certain doors like this open doesn't mean you you you don't have
34:03
a good heart doesn't mean you you wanted to be used by the enemy in this way no
34:09
we have to be wise as a serpent amen but I say this for you to be to be
34:17
aware of this like don't have your your guard down
34:23
when it comes to receiving God's voice don't just listen to
34:29
anybody even even if they they seem to have a great heart they seem to display
34:36
good fruits but are they the Shepherd that God entrusted you
34:42
to that's the question you you you have to remember that
34:52
amen Revelation 12:4 it says his tail drew a third of the stars of Heaven
34:58
and threw them to the Earth so the devil the meaning of this
35:03
is the devil actually brought with him as he
35:09
fell a third of the
35:15
Angels isn't that shocking when you think about it like Angels the Devil
35:22
Himself who is the head worshipper that's just wild but him and a third of the angel
35:28
literally just decided to say no I'm not going to listen to the she my shepherd's voice God's voice and I'm going to
35:35
listen to a different voice or I'm going to listen to my what I want or I'm those angels I'm going to
35:41
listen to the Head worshipper because he's so high up maybe he knows something
35:47
or you know if that can happen to them that can happen
35:53
today right so we have to be aware and and walk in
35:59
wisdom to schemes of the enemy to try to
36:04
bring people away from where God has called them to be planted where they will prosper and walk in their calling
36:10
and have Abundant Life and be in the covering and have protection in the spiritual realm of course the devil
36:17
doesn't like you to be here where God's called you to be planted so you got to be ungard and ready for any es scheme of
36:24
the devil that could come your way amen
36:33
so when you you have to understand that that your family in Christ that we're
36:41
that we're all different everyone's different maturity levels in the spiritual
36:47
realm and everyone may be different surrender
36:52
levels different levels of surrender and that's okay we're on a
36:59
journey for me it didn't work out to my mid 20s that I finally surrendered everything to God it's a journey for
37:06
many of us and so it's it's not like a shame thing or like a judgmental thing
37:12
that if you're here now and you're not surrendered to God no you are welcome here the more you keep seeking God the
37:19
more that God's power his spirit will move upon your life and move you to surrender so we want people of all
37:27
levels of surrender here because this is how the the true surrender and salvation
37:33
will come as one keeps seeking God and we respect God's will we're not going to
37:39
be like give your life to Jesus right now or you're going to go to hell come on we're not going to be that way we're
37:45
going to get we want to do it God's way which is give you free will and be
37:51
gentle and not force you and make you feel like um pressured to raise your
37:57
hand and repeat or repeat after me prayer no we're going to let you on your
38:03
own time make your own wedding vows to Jesus
38:10
amen no arranged marriages here
38:16
hallelujah but that means that you need to walk in wisdom with your family and
38:22
Christ there's different levels of surrender here it some times takes a
38:28
while to clean out the old wine to clean out the religious
38:34
Doctrine it it doesn't come overnight usually and many of you can testify
38:40
probably that when you those of you that are completely clean or mostly clean of old wine religious
38:48
Doctrine you can probably testify that you used to be judgmental you used to be skeptical and critical of the new move
38:55
of God of certain teachings that God has brought
39:00
Revelations but then God opened up your eyes as you humbled yourself and he cleaned
39:06
you and so with that being said you got to be aware of what could be around you
39:13
in your family that that that you who once was judgmental and just your eyes weren't
39:20
open completely yet there could be others that are the same
39:25
way you got to be aware of that so that you stay focused and don't listen to
39:32
wrong voices
39:37
amen and there's also there's also people with different motives once again I said that doors wide open and
39:45
sometimes I've seen different Revival events we've had even recently you can really see that that really we let
39:51
anyone come but you can't stay if you're going to um be trying to um stop the
39:57
move of God of course but we let you come it's up to you if you want to allow
40:03
yourself to stay and receive amen so there's going to be people with
40:08
different motives there's going to be people who
40:14
um the motive is hidden maybe they're even wrestling in
40:19
their heart different motives of why they're in the house of God so we got to be
40:25
aware of that because a voice could come from there if that open door of the
40:31
enemy is there that could be speaking the wrong gospel wrong Doctrine
40:41
amen so if if there's going to if you have
40:47
old wine and there's Pride mixed in there that's going to automatically be a Pharisee
40:54
situation so we'll always see that whenever we see the B will come alive and the the the the the ministry of
41:00
Jesus look like how it was in the times of Jesus and in the times of the Apostles we're always going to have that
41:06
Pharisee Spirit [Music] around so we got to be
41:15
aware now um I want to just share some things
41:21
that things to be aware of that can happen you know um when Jesus was
41:26
preaching about he there there's a time in the Bible where after he fed the thousands and so when he fed the
41:33
thousands that that meant that like pretty much most if not all became his
41:38
disciples started following him and so there's a story in the Bible that after
41:43
he feeds them the thousands he preaches a sermon and he preaches a controversial
41:52
message it was some new pure wine that allow a lot of people with the old wine
41:58
could not agree with and were actually offended the Bible says and that was
42:05
Jesus says these strong words like you must eat my flesh and drink my blood and
42:12
that's how you will be saved and have true life and of course we know now what he's
42:19
talking about we have Revelation understanding we understand communion is what he's speaking of but those people I
42:27
mean they had old wine in them still some a lot of them the close disciples they were pretty cleaned up in that area
42:34
and they were humble but the thousands the many more had old wine there and so
42:40
when they heard this the Bible says that they were like they were offended it said and it
42:47
the Bible says that many left Jesus because of those words he spoke that
42:53
sermon he spoke that doctrine that was pure new wine but to so many people many
43:00
disciples that were following him it was like blast it was like um it was not the
43:07
word of God it was going against the word of God and so many left
43:14
him and then Jesus turns to his disciples and we can interpret in the scripture that it was really just the 12
43:20
left and he says well will you leave me too and they say where where could we
43:26
go' your word your word has given us life um so you can see like they were
43:33
truly humble were not having other motives and were clean of the old wine
43:39
those other that left had a combination of those three and that's why they
43:46
left but they were there they were happy when they were
43:52
fed they were happy with the Miracles happening they were happy with the other world that Jesus was
43:58
speaking but then Jesus spoke a new Fresh Revelation new
44:04
wine and they left who could see that
44:09
coming the the close disciples to Jesus could they see that coming no these
44:15
people were Jesus we love you they they looked like they had
44:20
really great hearts and they had some of them probably had decent Hearts they were just deceived and they weren't cleaned yet
44:27
their old wine but they still left the Bible comes alive
44:34
today so like that kind of thing will happen today like people you could be caught
44:40
off guard like what why have they left this move of God this revival after the
44:47
testimonies that have happened in their life a situation like that can
44:52
happen but um that's why I say you have to be wise as a serpent because they couldn't see it coming they didn't know
44:59
that these 12 disciples didn't know that the others weren't as humble and pure and full of the new wine and void of the
45:06
old win skin as they were they didn't know that and I teach us to say simply don't
45:14
be listening to other voices when God's not calling you to listen to other
45:21
[Applause] voices I I I I don't say this to feel
45:26
skeptical and uneasy and no no no like I'm just saying just rest and focus on
45:33
what God's calling you to be focused on listen to The Shepherd's voice don't listen to other voices because they're
45:40
not called to be your Shepherd and they could have something funky there that
45:46
could Lead You astray
45:52
amen also um Judas Judas wasn't some
45:58
evil guy but we have free will Judas was truly chosen as a disciple he had a
46:04
great pure heart but he made wrong decisions along the
46:10
way he opened a door because we have free will Judas had Free Will opened a
46:17
door and allowed the and other voices to speak to him allow angel of Light to
46:22
speak to him and so he ended up betraying Jesus
46:28
but the disciples didn't see that coming right before he betrayed
46:33
Jesus um at the Last Supper Jesus says one of you will betray me and the Bible
46:39
says they have no clue that means that they saw Judas as a
46:46
just amazing pure heart that could be
46:52
trusted but not be trusted as a Shepherd in their life amen
46:57
um we also see this story in the Bible um John 12:14 sorry John 12:4 Judas the
47:07
disciple who would soon betray him said that perfume was worth a Year's wages it should it should have been sold and the
47:13
money given to the poor not that he cared for the poor for he was a thief and since he was in charge of the disciples money he often stole some for
47:21
himself so um J J uh you can see how you can see
47:30
how the other disciples they were watching Mary pour this expensive perfume and they were just disciples
47:35
they were Learners they were like whoa this is something we've never seen before but I'm watching and listening
47:41
and seeing how Jesus responds and learning from this right amen but Judas
47:48
wasn't that way he wasn't being a humble learner disciple in that moment and he was immediately judging and he was
47:54
immediately speaking a wrong Doctrine he was immed immediately getting a wrong Doctrine in his head and it who knows
48:00
where it could have gone from there it could have gone from like man maybe Jesus isn't who I thought he was like I
48:06
thought he really cared about the poor but this does not make sense why he wouldn't stop Mary in the middle of
48:12
pouring out that perem and say Mary you're precious that's so sweet but let's save some of this and G and and
48:19
sell it so we can give it to the poor you know like that kind of thing Judas could be thinking in his head probably
48:25
after we see what he says and so he can then pass this message around to the disciples he could become bring this
48:33
poison you see so this is why don't make other people be your Shepherd
48:40
hallelujah praise God and I want to share one other thing
48:46
to just to be aware of to to walk in wisdom to be wise as a serpent is that
48:55
um some you know as um as
49:01
Shepherds spiritual leaders on this Earth spiritual leaders of church God calls us
49:06
to fish into the ocean of all of the lost people in the world and just any
49:14
that could include people who are believers but stuck in religious bondage so we're called to
49:21
fish and then God wants us to catch them and then then so it's like we put
49:27
the fish that we've caught in our basket and that's whom God has entrusted us to and that's that's the church that's the
49:34
Sheep amen but there's this principle in the
49:39
spiritual realm like this is God's work and and those fish God wants them there
49:45
not other places there those specific fish not the other fish they go to other
49:51
uh fishermen Shepherds in their baskets right but
49:56
there can be some people who are going against the order of God who can try to
50:03
come and fish instead of fishing in the ocean fish in a shepherd's
50:11
basket that's wrong that's pulling people that God has
50:17
planted them there he wants them there it's pulling them from there that's
50:22
really bad you know but PE there's people out there who do that
50:27
there's people who can come who um they can just come to the church for that with that
50:33
motive and so they can start approaching people in like a you know like maybe
50:39
start prophesying maybe start saying God says this over your life maybe start becoming
50:45
close to a person like a mentorship type thing and sometimes people want that
50:52
close uh mentorship but that doesn't mean that that's what God's called you to we don't need the close mentorship to
50:59
really thrive in God's calling we need a shepherd and to hear the teachings and and be true disciples and
51:06
take them to heart and apply them amen but the devil can capitalize on that and
51:12
and people can come in that way there could also be people in the church that
51:18
maybe they start to get antsy like they're really really hungry to start
51:23
ministering maybe they believe God's called them to be a pastor and whether or a minister in some capacity and
51:29
whether that's their calling or not sometimes one may feel antsy and go outside the will of God and feel like
51:35
they want to start fishing but fishing in the shepherd's
51:42
basket like fishing in in the the church that they're at you know presenting themselves in a
51:48
in a pastoral or like Mentor type way when that's not what God called them to so I share that so you can be a
51:57
aware of that scheme of the enemy and how that can happen with different kinds of motives and and things an angel of
52:03
Light speaking to people as well so you know what's going on if that happens and so you don't listen to the wrong voice
52:13
amen you can do a good thing but in the wrong way and the wrong
52:20
timing let me repeat that you can do a good thing but in the wrong way in the
52:26
wrong timing outside of God's will outside of his timing so like to it it can be your
52:36
calling to be a leader in Ministry in some area you know whether it's leading
52:42
a church whether it's leading a worship night whether it's leading a Bible study
52:47
whether it's leading a prayer group whether it's leading a missions trip you
52:53
know that's all a Ministry lead leadership role that we shouldn't take
52:59
lightly and the Bible says in uh James 3:1 dear brothers and sisters not many
53:05
of you should become teachers in the church for we who teach will be judged more strictly and that's not just
53:11
talking about fful ministers that's really applies to any kind of leadership
53:16
role in Ministry be it a prayer group worship night bible study leading a
53:21
missions Group whatever that verse applies and so some are called to that some are not and when
53:28
you are called to that it has to be in God's timing it also has to be in God's
53:41
order by that I mean if you are called to be planted in a
53:47
church you can't just decide to start a worship night on your
53:54
own without you know going in the order the proper way is because because
54:02
we take this leadership role really really really seriously especially because of the the power of God moving
54:08
in this place you don't want to play with the devil when you are planning where the power of God is you got to do
54:14
things in order like when you step up into a leadership position in any area you are
54:21
putting a bigger Target on your back for the devil when it's God timing and
54:27
you're anointed you will have Victory the devil can try all he
54:32
wants Hallelujah but when it's not God's
54:37
timing you won't have Victory it's when you go outside of his will it's outside of his
54:43
grace and so it's very damaging for you spiritually and it's very damaging for
54:49
others that you are leading you see and so the proper order
54:54
so that you all know here at five-fold Church a proper order for that you know there will be times we are remember we
55:00
are in a season right now of building the foundation We are following the cloud we are getting the old wine out of
55:08
the people so people can really ra raise up to be pure and ready to lead
55:14
hallelujah it's God's timing not ours and it takes longer than we want many times and so in the future we here will
55:22
have all sorts of activities all sorts of ministry not just Sunday service and the live streams even though that's a
55:28
lot and more than enough and that's all that you need all that we need all you need for the spiritual equipping in this
55:33
season but there will be different season where there's many other ministers other five-fold ministry here
55:39
Ministry other things going on but it's not God's timing yet but when the time comes for another activity another
55:47
Ministry activity such as like a worship night or a Bible study or things like this the proper order is for God to
55:56
speak to the leader and say this person is ready and I've anointed them to be a
56:04
leader and then they can be trusted because they've been they've been uh
56:10
molded for a long enough time that they have the pure Doctrine in them that they
56:16
can teach and Lead well and that if things crop up enemy comes and attacks in some way they can solve the issue
56:24
they can have patience they can follow the the holy spirit's voice they will be loving to enemies things like this that
56:30
can happen they will have the fruits of the spirit and on top of that they will be humble to ask questions to the
56:38
leader that's very important you know because because we're we're all in a journey to learn you're
56:44
not going to be okay it's been two years three years and you're set for life you're a perfect leader that knows
56:50
everything God won't do it that way he will purposely purposefully sometimes
56:56
Maybe maybe you'll have questions and you won't be certain about something and that's God speaking to you humble yourself and go ask your leader and the
57:02
answer is there and this is how I can keep you accountable how God can keep you accountable and you can stay humble
57:09
and things and the shepherd can be sure that the people are safe because the shepherd knows what's
57:16
going on in the house the shepherd can can make sure the
57:21
pure Doctrine is being released only amen so that would be the proper order
57:27
is that God would speak to the leader it's time for this person to commission them to anoint them and to to bless them
57:34
to now go do this go do this go do this and then they come humbly and and ask
57:40
questions and the leader can say how is it going and what happened and keep what are you what are you teaching or what
57:46
keep me updated amen hallelujah so I share that for you
57:51
to know how the order works so that you don't accidentally listen to to wrong voices that might not be operating in
57:59
order amen
58:06
hallelujah praise God praise God thank you Jesus so today was a a
58:15
message that is leading to for you to be protected stay safe and keep what you
58:23
have and and grow into discern from today you have grown in discernment and
58:29
wisdom and I declare that nothing no scheme of the devil can take you out of
58:35
God's hand out of God's will out of where God's called you to be planted and I declare over all of you
58:42
right now that you would be safe that you would be protected and that you would hear the shepherd's voice and
58:50
follow it you would always hear the shepherd's voice and follow it
58:58
amen amen praise God
