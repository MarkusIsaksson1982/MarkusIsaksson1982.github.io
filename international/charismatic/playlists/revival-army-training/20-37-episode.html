hi I'm Apostle Catherine welcome to
0:33
another episode of Revival is now today
0:37
you will learn how a Christian can be
0:40
demonically oppressed and how to be
0:43
delivered from demonic oppression the
0:45
reality is so many Believers are bound
0:48
by demonic oppression and don't even
0:51
have any clue in this revival God is
0:54
opening up spiritual eyes there are
0:57
areas in the body of Christ where our
1:00
eyes have been just shut and meanwhile
1:02
the devil's eyes and the Demon's eyes
1:04
are spiritually open we are more
1:06
powerful than the devil but only if we
1:10
can actually see into the spiritual
1:12
realm otherwise we are carnal and
1:15
fighting in a spiritual war you can't
1:17
win that war the devil came to steal
1:19
kill and destroy John 10 10 but Jesus
1:21
says I have come that you would have
1:22
Abundant Life so the devil's still at
1:24
work today trying to steal kill and
1:28
destroy and he is successful when
1:32
believers do not know how to defeat his
1:36
schemes and how to receive the
1:39
inheritance of Abundant Life from Jesus
1:41
Christ the way that the Devil comes and
1:43
steals kills and destroys is by bringing
1:45
Yokes upon people's lives a yoke is
1:49
simply a work of the devil it says in
1:51
Isaiah 10 27 that the Yoke shall be
1:53
destroyed because of the anointing so
1:56
the anointing of Jesus is what destroys
1:59
these works of the devil so weapons are
2:02
formed against Believers all the time
2:04
and sometimes a Believer if their
2:05
spiritual eyes are not open they do not
2:07
know how to stop the weapon and they
2:09
allow it to come in and it becomes a
2:11
yoke an example of a yoke or demonic
2:14
Spirit a press question whatever you
2:16
want to call it the word doesn't matter
2:17
but basically what it is is it's a
2:20
spiritual demonic chain where you are
2:23
stuck where in your own strength you are
2:27
not able to break the chain so an
2:29
example of a yoke is anxiety depression
2:32
Suicidal Thoughts mental illness demonic
2:36
dreams a spirit of infirmity a demon
2:39
that can actually be behind a sickness
2:41
poverty division really anything where
2:45
you notice there is some sort of
2:47
spiritual chain where no matter how hard
2:50
you try no matter how hard you try to
2:52
crucify your flesh it will not break for
2:55
example addiction you can try and try
2:58
and try to stop smoking drinking but
3:01
that craving is still there many times
3:03
preachers have been preaching you just
3:05
need to crucify your flesh you just need
3:06
to stop doing what you're doing you need
3:08
to stop looking at porn for example and
3:11
then the person is trying so hard and
3:13
they're praying and they're fasting and
3:15
they have an accountability partner and
3:17
everything but nothing's changing that
3:21
addiction is still there that is a yoke
3:24
or demonic Spirit demonic oppression a
3:27
demon how can Christians have a demon
3:29
well when you give your life to Jesus
3:31
holy spirit makes your spirit come alive
3:34
the spirit is the real you and your
3:37
spirit becomes one with the Holy Spirit
3:41
and there nothing can touch the spirit
3:44
the spirit is pure it's why God calls
3:46
you the righteousness of God he's
3:48
looking at the real you which is your
3:50
spirit this is what goes to heaven and
3:52
lives eternally
3:54
but you also have a soul and a body your
3:58
soul is your mind your will and your
3:59
emotions so when you give your life to
4:02
Jesus
4:03
there is a lot of transformation that
4:05
needs to take place in the soul it
4:06
doesn't happen overnight for example you
4:09
can have lots of your own desires your
4:11
own will your own thoughts that aren't
4:14
gods and at first they might be stronger
4:17
than God's thoughts but as you seek God
4:19
you become transformed into His Image
4:22
where the parts of your flesh
4:25
your own desires your own Tendencies to
4:29
be jealous angry selfish those things
4:34
subside and the character of Christ
4:38
selflessness gentleness kindness love
4:41
peace patience Unity these things arise
4:46
far bigger until they completely wipe
4:50
out all of the fleshly ways that were
4:53
once there and so these things come as
4:55
you seek God as you put your eyes to
4:57
Jesus and surrender your life to him but
4:59
sometimes a Christian will be seeking
5:02
God doing all the things that the word
5:04
of God is saying like reading the Bible
5:06
daily praying to God daily
5:09
um closing doors to the devil not
5:11
sinning going to church regularly doing
5:15
all the like right Christian things
5:18
sometimes that a Christian may find that
5:21
there's still stuff in their soul that's
5:23
not changing nothing's happening and it
5:26
becomes many times a secret sin it
5:28
becomes many times something somebody's
5:30
ashamed of and they they feel so stuck
5:32
like they don't know what's wrong with
5:33
them why won't this go away why won't
5:34
this addiction why won't this rage go
5:36
away and the reason why is because it is
5:40
a demonic yoke
5:41
a demonic spirit and only the anointing
5:44
can destroy that yoke that's why
5:46
nothing's happening and so when you give
5:49
your life to Jesus it's a known thing
5:51
that the soul needs tons of work I mean
5:53
when somebody gets a life to Jesus
5:55
sometimes it needs a lot of work
5:58
sometimes somebody's like still super
6:01
angry still swearing a lot still really
6:04
wanting to drink but they have the Hope
6:06
in Christ and they they're a little more
6:08
peaceful for example it's a known thing
6:10
that sometimes there's a lot of work
6:13
that needs to be done on day one of
6:14
giving your life to Jesus well in the
6:16
same way we should also know that there
6:18
might be junk in the soul dirt in the
6:22
soul that's actually yolks there too not
6:24
just
6:25
the flesh is high and we need to push it
6:28
down and crucify the flesh but there are
6:30
actually Yokes that have come in through
6:31
open doors when you give your life to
6:33
Jesus it doesn't mean demons immediately
6:36
come out if that were the case every
6:39
single believer that gives a life to
6:41
Jesus they would have the same testimony
6:43
that every single stronghold chain
6:46
immediately left the day they gave their
6:49
lives to Jesus sometimes it happens
6:50
sometimes there's those stories of
6:52
addiction left completely depression
6:53
left completely but they're rare
6:55
honestly for the most part people have
6:57
yolks that they stay stuck with for so
7:00
long get rid of all moral filth and the
7:03
evil that is so prevalent and humbly
7:05
accept the word planted in you which can
7:08
save you
7:10
the word of God can save us the word of
7:13
God when we follow it it will deliver us
7:16
I think sometimes people have a hard
7:18
time believing that Christians can
7:19
actually have demons because maybe they
7:20
feel like well how God how could God
7:22
allow that but the truth is is that the
7:26
word of God is given to us to completely
7:29
Deliver us when we need Deliverance
7:31
number one and number two to help us
7:34
have every door kept shut so no demon
7:37
can ever enter
7:39
but we need to take the word of God
7:40
seriously number one and number two we
7:43
need to have true Revelation from the
7:45
Holy Spirit which also means we really
7:48
need the faithful Ministry to equip us
7:50
to give us true Revelation media
7:53
teaching not this lukewarm stuff you
7:56
find in the church most these days we
7:58
need real equipping like how to keep
8:00
doors shut to the devil that's not a
8:03
usual big teaching you hear around the
8:05
body of Christ by and large so you can
8:07
see why many Christians are in bondage
8:09
if we had completely in the whole body
8:12
of Christ today the fivefold ministry in
8:15
place if we had past Generations that
8:18
were serious about
8:20
serving God's surrendering and raising
8:23
their children up so they they start day
8:26
one from not opening up doors to the
8:28
devil being equipped knowing God's love
8:29
and power then we could come to a place
8:32
and say pretty much it's so rare to ever
8:34
find a Christian with demons and we're
8:37
going there
8:38
but Revival's Just Begun we've got a lot
8:41
of work to do and there's been a lot of
8:43
spiritual blindness for a very long time
8:45
that's the biggest reason why many
8:47
Christians have demons today so we need
8:49
to take the word of God seriously and we
8:51
need to actually have Revelation from
8:52
the word of God not just read through it
8:54
God is so good he's given us everything
8:56
we need in the word to be free and to
8:59
completely stay free we should never
9:01
blame God for having demonic Yokes he's
9:05
the one who saved us he's the one who's
9:07
come to destroy the works of the devil
9:08
and give us Abundant Life do not give
9:10
the devil a foothold here we go this is
9:15
a powerful word where it's showing us
9:16
God is speaking directly to us
9:19
don't give the devil a foothold
9:21
because then he'll be able to come in a
9:24
foothold means like if you open the door
9:26
a crack
9:27
you're allowing space for something to
9:30
someone to come in
9:31
easily that's giving a foothold and this
9:35
is written to a church of the Ephesians
9:38
it's written to a church so this is not
9:41
speaking to the world don't give up all
9:43
to the devil it's given to literal
9:45
Believers so these instructions are
9:47
showing us
9:48
if you choose to give a foothold to the
9:50
devil then he can come in then demons
9:52
can come in
9:54
here's a here's a way to really try to
9:56
understand how Christians can't have
9:58
demons is look at addiction okay
10:01
if you have a Christian
10:03
who if you take a Christian and a
10:06
non-believer and they both
10:09
drink the same amount of alcohol every
10:11
day is the Christian protected from
10:14
being addicted
10:15
no
10:17
this is common sense it doesn't matter
10:20
what your belief is if you have the Holy
10:22
Spirit or not if you're choosing to
10:24
drink and drink and drink take drugs
10:26
you're gonna get addicted
10:28
common sense right well addiction is
10:33
actually a demon
10:35
so when you can understand that so many
10:37
things so many so many problems that
10:41
people have that Christians have are
10:43
actually demons you can understand why
10:46
Christians can have demons if you don't
10:48
take drugs and alcohol you won't open a
10:50
door to a demon and you won't get a
10:51
demon in that area but if you do
10:54
you could get a demon it's simple like
10:57
that that's how it is in the spiritual
10:58
ROM if you open a door if you give a
11:00
foothold to the devil you could get a
11:01
demon it's just like when I'm in my
11:03
apartment I might get a priority to lock
11:05
my door but if I was lazy with it let's
11:08
say I left my door open even there's
11:11
a pretty good chance that someone could
11:13
come in someone could take something
11:14
it's up to me to take it seriously it's
11:16
totally up to me I can't blame God if
11:19
someone comes and steals something from
11:20
my house when I left the door wide open
11:22
the eye is the lamp of the body if your
11:24
eyes are healthy your whole body will be
11:26
will be full of light but if your eyes
11:28
are unhealthy your whole body will be
11:30
full of Darkness if then The Light
11:31
Within You is Darkness how great is that
11:34
Darkness once again this is written to
11:36
Believers so it's not saying like just
11:38
because you give your life to Jesus you
11:40
will be void of Darkness you have to
11:42
choose where you put your eyes you have
11:44
to choose where you put your focus if
11:46
you put your focus on things of light of
11:49
things that are good and pure worthy of
11:51
Praise admirable Godly things the things
11:54
of God then you will be filled with
11:56
light and you will keep doors shut to
11:58
the devil but if you decide to put your
12:03
eyes to Darkness meditate on Darkness
12:07
think and speak things of the enemy you
12:11
will literally be filling yourself with
12:13
Darkness opening up doors for demonic
12:16
spirits to come in in darkness to fill
12:18
you therefore get rid of all moral filth
12:20
and the evil that is so prevalent and
12:22
humbly accept the word planted in you
12:23
which can save you do not merely listen
12:25
to the word and so deceive yourselves do
12:28
what it says anyone who listens to the
12:30
word but does not do what it says is
12:32
like someone who looks at his face in a
12:34
mirror and after looking at himself goes
12:35
away and immediately forgets what he
12:37
looks like but whoever looks intently
12:39
into the perfect law that gives freedom
12:42
and continues in it not forgetting what
12:44
they have heard but doing it they will
12:47
be blessed in what they do if we take
12:51
the word of God seriously we will be
12:53
blessed we will be protected we will we
12:56
will be set free and walk in Abundant
12:58
Life here are some examples of the word
13:01
of God that's bringing Freedom that's
13:04
protecting you as you follow it all of
13:06
these that I'm about to share see many
13:08
people just read right by them not
13:09
knowing that this is the perfect law
13:13
that gives Freedom that can save us that
13:18
will make us be blessed in all we do so
13:21
now it's time to take this word of God
13:23
as the pathway to freedom and Abundant
13:27
Life like it really is so number one is
13:30
take every thought captive to Christ so
13:32
this is literally an instruction from
13:34
God of how to keep doors shut to the
13:36
devil one of the big ways is where the
13:39
devil's trying to come in your mind he's
13:40
trying to get you to accept his lies to
13:43
think that they're truth and speak them
13:45
and there's so much power when you speak
13:47
that this is an open door to the demon
13:50
meditating so much on on the devil's
13:52
lies is an open door to the devil where
13:54
demons can come in and number two is
13:56
speaking what you've been meditating on
13:59
from the enemy so take every thought
14:01
captive to Christ this is literally
14:05
instruction of how to lock that door
14:08
when the devil's trying to knock in that
14:11
area in your mind life and death is in
14:13
the power of your tongue and so wow if
14:16
we could take that word of God so
14:18
seriously we would be bolting that lock
14:21
on the door to the devil so strong as we
14:25
are so careful over our every word and
14:28
we are sure to never speak death this is
14:31
instruction from God of how to keep that
14:33
door shut to the devil of words of
14:35
speaking words of death don't give a
14:37
foothold to the devil is another one
14:38
that that should
14:40
we should have this kind of Revelation
14:42
when we read the scripture of
14:44
I better lock my door I gotta remember
14:47
to do that just as
14:48
in Physical Realm we get into a habit of
14:52
it we take it seriously we value our car
14:55
our apartment so when we make sure we
14:59
get in a habit of locking that car we
15:02
get in the habit of locking the door
15:04
when we leave when we come in the house
15:06
we take it seriously because we value it
15:08
well we should value our spiritual
15:10
health and protection even more so we
15:12
should be even more intentional daily
15:14
throughout your everyday to keep that
15:17
door shut we need to be serious in the
15:19
spiritual realm living every day my
15:21
mission is to serve God please him be in
15:24
his will and never open up a door to the
15:27
devil that should be our biggest mission
15:30
of every single day of Our Lives but yet
15:33
many sin just because they feel like it
15:35
and not even thinking about the
15:36
repercussions my eyes just opened up in
15:39
the spiritual realm about seven years
15:40
ago to all this truth you know I didn't
15:43
know that we could be I never knew that
15:45
if I would sin it was actually open in a
15:48
door where a demon could come in I had
15:50
no clue about that and I was thinking
15:53
that sins had no repercussions other
15:55
than it's not pleasing to God that's all
15:58
I thought it was and so when you see the
16:00
word of God without that Revelation you
16:03
you kind of just are like why what's
16:05
what's the beauty of the word why do we
16:07
have to follow it it can even feel like
16:09
God just has these pointless rules that
16:12
he wants us to follow that's how a lot
16:14
of people think and missing the
16:15
revelation of how precious the word of
16:17
God is keeps us from having revelation
16:20
of God's love and keeps us from keeping
16:22
the door shut to the devil when I was in
16:24
high school and college I opened up
16:26
plenty of doors I look back and I just
16:29
know
16:32
just know that if I had known this if I
16:35
had known how precious his word it was
16:37
that his word was literally a blueprint
16:40
a road map to keeping every door shut to
16:44
the enemy to have Abundant Life I would
16:48
have clung the Bible so Ty I would have
16:51
taken the word of God seriously and I
16:53
would have had no interest for the
16:54
things of the world if I knew it was
16:55
like so spiritually dangerous it's not
16:58
worth it you know and and I would have
17:01
fallen in love with God more many people
17:03
are not falling in love with God because
17:05
they don't they're missing Revelation
17:06
like how good it is of god to give us
17:10
his word to give us a road map to keep
17:13
us safe and have Abundant Life God
17:16
didn't just give us random rules to
17:19
follow but it's for our good and lastly
17:22
this passage we read earlier if your
17:24
eyes are unhealthy your whole body will
17:26
be full of darkness and then The Light
17:28
Within You is Darkness how great is that
17:30
Darkness so we need to be careful what
17:32
we're watching we need to every movie
17:35
everything we're listening to as well
17:37
every movie we watch everything we're
17:39
focusing on despair doubt mean words
17:43
that somebody spoke what we're scrolling
17:46
on what we're scrolling and watching on
17:48
our social media who are following we
17:51
should be so careful about this we
17:52
should be so wise to make sure that
17:56
we're not putting our eyes to Darkness
17:57
we're not watching scary movies we are
17:59
not watching things that bring fear that
18:02
pollute us but only put our eyes to the
18:05
light the things of God so now when you
18:07
read the word of God read it with new
18:09
eyes read it with Revelation this is my
18:14
blueprint from Heaven to Abundant Life
18:17
Freedom protection this is so precious
18:21
if I read it and actually live it out as
18:25
it says do not be someone who just
18:27
listens to the word but actually do what
18:30
it says this these are just some
18:32
examples of ways that the word of God
18:34
protects you and leads you to freedom
18:38
and Abundant Life but there are so many
18:40
more so when you read the word of God
18:42
now God will open up your eyes read it
18:45
slowly read it with intention read it
18:48
looking for instructions and directions
18:50
of how to lead you to Abundant Life now
18:54
if you have opened up doors to the enemy
18:57
if you know there is yokes demonic
19:00
oppression in your life Jesus has come
19:03
to deliver you this is part of your
19:06
inheritance as a child of God by his
19:08
stripes you are healed this includes
19:11
Freedom complete healing complete
19:14
freedom and so even if you have opened
19:17
up doors in the past even if it was
19:19
earlier today Jesus has forgiven you as
19:22
soon as you come to him and say Lord I
19:24
Surrender I Repent which means I turn
19:27
from my past ways of sin I want to
19:31
follow you and serve you and be in your
19:33
will as soon as you do that Jesus has
19:36
taken away all of the past completely
19:38
wiped it away all the sins and he
19:41
desires to free you immediately it's not
19:45
like you have to wait a minute be
19:48
punished and then he frees you no this
19:50
gift of freedom and healing is we it can
19:52
be earned but it's a free gift that
19:55
Jesus gives us by coming to him by
19:57
surrendering Our Lives to him so the
20:00
first step of receiving deliverance from
20:03
these areas where doors have been opened
20:05
is to surrender to Jesus is to really
20:08
surrender from the heart is to make the
20:11
decision I don't want this anymore you
20:14
know sometimes people are stuck in
20:16
bondage let's say addiction but there's
20:18
a part of it that they enjoy maybe they
20:20
enjoy the taste of the beer maybe they
20:22
enjoy the social aspect of their
20:25
Drinking Buddies you have to choose to
20:28
give that up you have to make that
20:31
choice before Jesus can free you Jesus
20:34
knows you can't do it on your own you
20:36
don't have to worry about getting rid of
20:38
the addiction and getting rid of the
20:39
yolk on your own but you need to make
20:41
the decision and tell God I'm ready I
20:45
want to leave this behind I don't want
20:47
this anymore I want to give this my sin
20:50
my Yokes I want to give them to you take
20:53
them and I won't turn back to them
20:55
anymore when you've freed me the second
20:57
step is to renounce and to renounce
21:00
means to abandon something you once
21:02
claimed as your own I shared in the
21:06
previous episode about renouncing and
21:09
specifically how to be free from word
21:12
curses renouncing was one of the steps
21:14
to be free of word curses but also word
21:17
curses are not the only area where
21:19
demonic oppression has come in but yet
21:21
renouncing is a key to be free from
21:24
every yoke so renouncing is abandoning
21:27
something you once claimed as your own
21:28
many of you have claimed the certain
21:30
bondage as your own whether it was you
21:32
claiming a sickness or the oppression
21:34
like I have anxiety I have a depression
21:36
I am suicidal I'm not pretty I'm not
21:38
good enough stuff like that so many of
21:40
you have claimed demonic oppression as
21:43
your own like saying I have anxiety
21:45
you're claiming the devil's portion
21:48
rather than saying I reject and resist
21:51
every spirit of fear I have a sound mind
21:54
I have perfect peace so all of these
21:56
areas where there's bondage usually
21:59
you've actually spoken you've claimed as
22:02
your own it's just become your portion
22:03
you need to now reverse that you need to
22:06
say I don't want this anymore I don't
22:08
claim this anymore I don't want the
22:10
devil's portion anymore I want God's
22:12
will God's portion that's what I want
22:14
and so renouncing is using your
22:15
Authority using the power of your words
22:17
to say I don't want you anymore I want
22:20
God's Will and when you renounce it's
22:21
also important to identify the open
22:24
doors the areas where that demonic
22:27
oppression came in it's like going into
22:28
the courtroom and doing things the legal
22:31
right way in the spiritual realm you go
22:33
to court prepared and you go to court
22:35
sharing on this day this person broke
22:39
into my apartment and stole this this
22:41
and this you say it specifically you're
22:44
not just like um this person did a crime
22:46
in the past like you need to be specific
22:49
and when there's evidence shown and it
22:52
can be proven there's Justice and you
22:56
win the case there are laws in the
22:58
spiritual realm so when you're coming to
22:59
Jesus to be free it's like you're going
23:01
into the courtroom of heaven but there's
23:03
laws in the spiritual realm and so
23:05
you're doing things the right way the
23:07
legal way in the spiritual realm you
23:09
need to use your Authority like you need
23:12
to show up just like you need to be a
23:13
person showing up to court you need to
23:15
testify you know you need to show up not
23:17
be like lazy and just let it try to come
23:19
to you you need to show up and use your
23:21
Authority so you're speaking now I
23:24
renounce anxiety I renounce addiction I
23:28
renounce taking those pills so you're
23:31
speaking the oppression that you don't
23:32
want that's what you're saying right now
23:34
it's I don't want this and also it's
23:36
already done but I'm like taking back
23:38
taking the drugs it's like you're saying
23:40
I renounce that I I don't want to be a
23:43
person who's taking drugs anymore
23:45
that's how it happened and I I don't
23:47
want to do it you made the conscious
23:48
decision to take drugs and it led to the
23:51
addiction so now you're basically saying
23:53
I don't want to take drugs in the future
23:55
I don't want addiction so as you
23:58
renounce where the power of God is
24:00
moving like here as you're watching this
24:02
program Jesus will set you free it's
24:05
time to be free right now you can begin
24:08
now to renounce to renounce all of the
24:12
areas where there are Yokes in your life
24:14
where there's demonic oppression all the
24:16
areas in your life where you know it's
24:18
not of God where you've been stuck These
24:20
Chains renounce them now and renounce
24:22
all of the open doors all of the areas
24:25
you I you can see this is where this
24:28
demonic Spirit might have come in speak
24:30
them aloud now
24:35
I detach you from everything you have
24:38
renounced and I Break Every curse and
24:40
every generational curse off you and
24:42
every word curse and every demonic Soul
24:44
tie I break it and I command on three
24:46
every Spirit attached to what you have
24:49
renounced must leave in Jesus name
24:54
one two three
24:57
out now in Jesus name
25:01
I declare complete freedom to you and I
25:05
speak healing over your body all
25:08
sickness gone I release this anointing
25:11
upon you that you would be filled with
25:14
the holy spirit filled with the fire of
25:17
his spirit filled with peace and joy and
25:19
Abundant Life and may you be filled with
25:22
wisdom as you read the word of God may
25:24
it come alive in new ways may you see
25:27
and hear God speaking to you saying go
25:31
this way close the door here May the
25:34
word come alive
25:35
in Jesus name here's an example of how
25:38
renouncing is a key that unlocks Freedom
25:43
parallel Hospital
25:46
ignored the side effects of it and it
25:48
just opened the door to a bunch it's how
25:51
on Earth it was hell on Earth all right
25:53
now it's the spirit that came in the
25:55
night
25:56
that pulled hair out of my head
25:58
[Music]
26:03
I renounce
26:06
Freemasonry in my generation line
26:10
autoimmune disease everything I came
26:13
through
26:18
Every curse
26:21
from all he's renounced
26:24
every last one of you must go on three
26:27
in Jesus name one two three
26:32
[Music]
26:34
oh yeah
26:38
[Music]
26:40
I'm a Christian and you'll see me
26:43
flailing around on the ground and there
26:45
are stuff there are demons leaving my
26:47
body there are demons leaving it's as
26:48
simple as that on the way here I was
26:50
repenting and I could feel things I
26:51
could feel it in my throat I was burping
26:53
or I was like it was just trying to come
26:54
out of my my mouth and I got powerfully
26:56
the first night by just repenting not
26:58
just in the heart but with my lips spoke
27:01
it and all of a sudden boom I was just
27:03
so willing to let it be on the surface
27:05
whatever it looks like giving it almost
27:07
permission so Jesus can drive it out so
27:09
it can be seen so it can't hide there
27:11
were new things that were revealed to me
27:12
the second night and tonight there were
27:15
new things that I could not see the
27:17
first night after Deliverance the first
27:19
night the second night new thoughts
27:21
third night new thoughts new layers of
27:23
the Holy Spirit revealing things and to
27:26
me to repent of again I'm a Christian
27:28
but there have been doors that I've I've
27:29
reopened and I came here and and God let
27:33
let your faith be built on power let it
27:35
be built on power not fancy words I'm
27:37
just so over that that's why I came here
27:41
oh like I feel this energy from from God
27:44
like it's it only comes from him it's
27:46
it's like this passion in me and I can't
27:48
be a Christian without without him being
27:50
that tangently real I feel lighter
27:52
clearer in the head let that speak for
27:54
itself thank you for watching I can't
27:56
wait for what God will do in the next
27:58
