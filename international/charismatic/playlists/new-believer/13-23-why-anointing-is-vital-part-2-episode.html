they're the ones
[Music]
this is part two of why the anointing is
vital on the previous episode I shared
how we need the anointing for people to
have encounters with Jesus the kingdom
of God is not a matter of talk but of
power and without the power of God in
the body of Christ many Christians are
just hearing about God but not actually
having encounters with him the next
reason why the anointing is vital in the
body of Christ is that the anointing is
needed to destroy the kingdom of
darkness the devil is still at work and
Jesus has called us to be vessels of him
to destroy the works of the devil in
people's lives the Bible says that the
yoke is destroyed because because of the
anointing to see demonic Yokes which are
demons sicknesses works of the devil
destroyed we need the anointing plain in
simple then some of the itinerant Jewish
exorcists took it upon themselves to
call the name of the Lord Jesus over
those who had evil spirits saying we
exercise you by the Jesus whom Paul
preaches also there were seven sons of
skiva a Jewish Chief priest who did so
Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are
you so the demons are saying that they
recognize Jesus they know him they
recognize Paul not just do they
recognize and know who they are but they
know that Jesus and Paul have authority
over them they know that they must obey
their commands no matter what demons
know they can see in the spiritual realm
where the authority of Christ is now
Jesus said to the disciples when they
came back from casting out demons for
the first time he says I've given you
all power over the enemy I've given you
authority over the Enemy by saying this
Jesus is explaining yes the demons
obeyed you because I gave you authority
over them Jesus then goes on to say
father I praise you for you've hidden
these things passion translation says
the great revelation of your Authority
from those who are proud and I've only
revealed it to those who are humble who
will become like children he reveals
that his authority his anointing is not
given to every single believer every
single person but it's only given to the
humble to the child like it is not given
to the proud the demons were recognizing
Paul in addition to Jesus because Jesus
had chosen to give Authority and
anointing to Paul
Paul could be trusted with this
anointing and Authority now when God
gives one anointing he is also giving
them Authority they are two in one
anointing is the power of God that
destroys Yokes that casts out demons
it's Authority that makes demons to go
so when God gives anointing there is
Authority in that anointing two in one
demons can see where true authority over
them is every single believer is given a
measure of authority the moment they
give their life to Jesus every single
believer is given authority over the
devil for their personal spiritual life
every believer can execute their
authority over the devil when the devil
is coming attacking their mind attacking
them as lies attacking their health
attacking their life attacking their
family you have authority over the devil
and when you use that Authority the
devil has to obey but there are higher
and higher degrees levels of an
authority than that it is God's will for
you to progress to be entrusted with a
higher level of authority so that you're
not only taking authority over the devil
in your own personal life but you're
able to help others you're able to do
the Great Commission and cast out demons
out of other people so these demons
there's a reason they say specifically
Paul there were other believers in that
time why did they specifically say Paul
it's because these demons were higher
level demons and they recognize a high
level authority of Christ in Paul where
they had to obey this higher level of
authority how demons are cast out is
simple when God entrusts a vessel with
authority and anointing when they go to
minister demons have to leave the higher
the level of authority the more demons
the more principalities the more higher
levels have to go the more sicknesses
have to go the more darkness is
destroyed we can see that Apostle Peter
was walking in the highest level of
authority that even principalities had
to obey because it says that they would
bring the sick and Demon possess under
where his shadow was going to pass by
and all he had to do was just pass by
with his shadow his authority was so
high level that he wasn't even having to
say words let alone scream things put
hands and struggle with physical effort
that's how high his authority level was
it was so high that the Bible says all
demons and all sicknesses left a big
reason why they were able to see a
hundred percent of the people who came
to church healed the big key was that
Peter
had the highest level authority of
Christ principalities couldn't get away
with anything they had to leave when the
anointing and Authority was present the
anointing is vital because it is the
anointing that makes demons sickness the
kingdom of darkness to leave people's
lives it is simply the anointing and
that Authority in that anointing so what
we have in the body of Christ today by
and large are many churches void of
anointing and this is the simple answer
why so many Christians have sicknesses
and oppressions like anxiety depression
Suicidal Thoughts
night terrors you name it
this is the simple answer the anointing
is not there at the church they're at at
the ministry they're receiving from this
is why Miracles have become rare today
because the anointing is rare oh it
becomes so easy and simple when simply
the anointing is there you don't need
anything else the anointing is Jesus
himself but Jesus in his fullness you
don't need anything else imagine in a
service of 1 000 people let's say 90 of
these people have sicknesses and
oppressions in one moment less than an
hour you can see 900 all of the people
be healed and delivered people who had
suicidal spirits who were planning to
commit suicide that night they were
saved they were delivered they were
filled with the joy of the Lord and they
went on to live a long life people who
were about to die from cancer that next
week the doctor had told them they had
one week to live they are healed right
there people who die too early can be
raised from the dead right there this is
the good news of Jesus Christ oh this is
great news it is not just about going to
heaven after we die that's not the only
part of the good news it is also that
Jesus has paid the price for you to be
healed and delivered completely now that
you do not have to suffer with sickness
and oppression anymore you can receive
freedom and healing and walk an abundant
life here and now oh that's amazing news
but so much of the body of Christ is
stuck in the church's staying with their
demons and sicknesses in most churches
around the world people are coming in
with demons listening to the sermon and
leaving with those demons those demons
are in every service laughing at us
sitting comfortably because it is the
anointing that makes them to go without
the anointing they sit comfortably and
they don't do not leave they do not
manifest even that's how comfortable
they are without the anointing people
are having these demons they're having
these demonic spiritual issues and no no
one's helping them spiritually in the
church the church leaders are just doing
what the world does saying go to the
counselor go to the doctor I'll keep you
in my prayers even the world says that
the world says prayers and well wishes
and it's just the same I'll keep you in
my prayers Jesus didn't say to say I'll
keep them in your prayers he says when
somebody has a demon cast it out when
someone is has sickness declare healing
lay hands on the sick do something about
it be a vessel of anointing and release
that anointing heal and deliver my
children don't say it'll keep you in my
prayers it does nothing don't send them
off to the world's ways and get them
even more locked into the world addicted
in to Medicine of anxiety when you're
supposed to just cast the demon of
anxiety out for so long in the body of
Christ people have not for the most part
people Christians have not seen Miracles
be common in the church for Generations
so it's understandable that there's
become this spiritual blindness and we
just think this is how you do it now and
miracles were in the past but it's not
an excuse anymore Revival is now God is
showing himself videos are going viral
of demons being cast out of people in
the masses of the sick being healed
there's no excuse now we cannot turn a
blind eye anymore the word of God should
be our standard not church as we see it
as we've known it as our parents and
grandparents have known it with no
Miracles the word of God should be our
standard and throughout the gospels
Jesus is constantly casting out demons
Healing The Sick in addition to
preaching you like never seen an example
of Jesus just preaching because there's
always
the sick that needs healing there's
always oppressed people who need to be
freed and Jesus loves his people so much
that he wants their freedom and heal
them immediately
that's our Jesus
and he commissioned the original
disciples to do the same things he did
and greater he said
heal the sick cast out demons he come he
commanded them to do that
he didn't say do it once in a while he
said this is what you should be doing as
you preach the kingdom of God as a hand
preach the kingdom of God is at hand and
then demonstrate that the kingdom of God
is at hand release the kingdom of God if
you want to see what church should look
like today look at the book of Acts it
is wild that that many Believers this
the moment they see healings and
deliverances instead of being excited
this is what I read about in the acts
Church
Hallelujah revivals now instead they
many times
feel uncomfortable feel I don't know
this is weird
I'm comfortable with church how it is
that's very sad and it's not okay we
should have the fear of God we have to
be accountable to God someday we don't
get to choose How We Do church we don't
get to choose to sit comfortably in our
church pew with an hour sir within our
service every week we don't get that
choice we are commanded by God to be
vessels of his anointing to respect and
honor his anointing and to Revere His
Holy Spirit
to love his spirit and how he moves all
the manifestations of the spirit the
beautiful baptism of the Holy Spirit and
the speaking in tongues the healing of
the sick the beauty of the anointing
making demons to tremble scream and
convulse oh that's beautiful because
it's Jesus coming and exposing the
darkness and removing it it's the most
beautiful thing in the world we are
called to cherish the work of the Holy
Spirit and allow him to do as he pleases
it is time to get very serious about
leaving a lukewarm Christian Life in
church and coming to God's real churches
where his anointing is where you can be
a part of the real work of God where you
can be equipped to be a vessel of the
anointing and be in a place to receive
impartation of the anointing so you can
be a vessel of God that cast out demons
and heal the sick and saves people
really saves them not just gives them a
powerless gospel but a vessel of God who
releases his power so people can really
encounter God fall in love with him be
healed and delivered and truly saved
it's time to get serious about being a
vessel God can entrust anointing with
and respecting his anointing his
anointed vessels and his precious work
of God even when you don't always
understand it even when it looks
different and new and strange to you but
that you respect and Revere the Holy
Spirit you become childlike so you can
come to a greater understanding so you
can accept the Holy Spirit and love him
and be a vessel of him at the services
that I minister at the anointing is so
present it is so present that even
before the sermon begins
the anointing will be flowing to people
who are there
and watching online the the annoying
team will literally come upon people and
all the demons all the darkness gets
exposed and just comes out before a
sermons preached so many times and we're
seeing demons shrieking out of people
before the sermon begins people are
getting delivered
immediately as soon as they come
position themselves where the anointing
is it is the most beautiful thing in the
world to see people be delivered from
the bondages of Satan to be healed from
their sicknesses and to have revelation
of God's love we need the anointing in
the church and for the kingdom of
darkness to be destroyed in their lives
and the next reason why we need the
anointing in the body of Christ today is
the anointing attracts people to Jesus
how do they get people to come to the
church in the times of Jesus and in the
acts Church well they did not have fancy
Graphics back then they did not have
fancy lights and fog machines and
entertaining epic videos and worship
band that was like a rock concert
experience they did not have air
conditioned huge fancy buildings but
what they did have was the anointing the
power of God
and it was truly the anointing alone
Jesus himself Jesus coming in power that
attracted masses to Jesus to his church
all throughout the gospels there's this
pattern Jesus ministers he preaches he
heals the sick casts out demons raises
the dead is performing Miracles and it
then goes on to say the word spread and
many more came the first harvest like
the first Revival after Jesus had
gathered his disciples and he was ready
to begin to minister to the masses he
encountered a Samaritan woman at the
well and she had this
prophetic Encounter With Jesus where she
encountered him in power she experienced
Miracles and her eyes opened up to his
love and that he was truly the Messiah
and she ran and told everybody she knew
and it says so many people came to Jesus
and they came to Jesus because of her
testimony meaning it wasn't her saying
there's going to be this amazing concert
oh look at these beautiful Graphics oh
look at the famous people here it was
I received miracles from Jesus you have
to meet Jesus this miracle worker who's
like no one you've ever met before
these people needed Miracles themselves
this is what attracted them to come to
Jesus and be saved healed and delivered
in the ACT church we see the same story
again and again this is Peter he took
her by the hand and helped her to her
feet then he called for the Believers
especially the widows and presented her
to them alive this became known all over
japa and many people believed in the
Lord so this woman was raised from the
dead by Peter
this amazing Miracle became known all
over the city and because people heard
about this miracle
they believed in the Lord it says it
wasn't from a preaching with no power
saying this is why you should believe in
God here's a repeat after me prayer
raise your hand
it wasn't that that made people truly
believe in the Lord back then it was
them hearing witnessing Miracles by the
power of God another miracle of Peter's
there he found a man named anias who was
paralyzed and had been bedridden for
eight years and nias Peter said to him
Jesus Christ heals you get up and roll
roll up your mat immediately anayas got
up all those who lived in Lita and
Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord so
it was the miracle the supernatural
miracle from the power of God
through Peter
healing and as that made people believe
in the Lord it was simple Jesus is the
Messiah he's the Savior and he does
Miracles look what he's done look at
anaeus we knew him he could not walk now
he's walking
this is what Jesus did and people
believed simple I believe now in the
body of Christ by and large today where
there is no anointing
it's like there's been this compensation
for no power of God that we're like
trying to find other marketing
techniques so you see this the the
worship bands being the main focus to
draw people people are coming
because they like the music and they
like to listen to worship music and
worship God to worship music maybe
graphics and videos and entertainment
and Charisma and comedy and fancy lights
fog machine nice building you name it
all of these things have been used to
try to bring people to Jesus but all of
these things are not going to actually
attract people to Jesus that's why it's
sometimes so hard for pastors to grow
churches pastors to see their churches
grow
the only thing that attracts is the real
Jesus who comes in power people talking
about him people testifying people
showing others look what God has done
look at this miracle that God has done
that's what literally attracts people
that's what attracts people for the
right reasons you know not just like oh
I like music I think I'm gonna go
because it's a cool worship band I like
the music that's not they're not coming
with the right reasons to even encounter
Jesus to even be saved but when they
come with this motive I've seen and
heard something I've never heard about I
have this belief that this God may be
real I want to come and check him out
and you they go to the church and there
is the real anointing there now the
anointing of God comes and touches them
and now their eyes have really opened
and they really can believe fully
receive Jesus as Lord receive Abundant
Life surrender to him it's it's real
it's real substance it's the real Jesus
attracting them Jesus and his power
attracting them and this is what makes
people to really be saved man it's time
to stop all the other techniques we've
got to try to attract people to come to
church attract people to come to Jesus
sometimes pastors put too much
entertainment comedy gimmicks and things
into preaching when none of that does
anything you just need the anointing we
need to yearn for the anointing we need
to hunger for the anointing
this moves us to a place of humility
when we see that we cannot do on our own
we cannot do it on our own strength we
cannot do it on our own power we cannot
do it on our own Charisma and and speak
you know we need the anointing which is
Jesus we need Jesus we need him in his
fullness here's an example that shows
why we need the anointing and how
powerful it is to have the anointing in
the body of Christ the people were
amazed at his teaching because he taught
them as one who had Authority just then
a man in their synagogue who is
possessed by an impure Spirit cried out
what are you
what do you want Jesus be quiet said
Jesus sternly come out of him the impure
Spirit shook the man violently and came
out of him with a shriek the people were
also amazed that they asked each other
what is this a new a new teaching and
with authority he even gives orders to
impure spirits and they obey him news
about him spread quickly over the whole
region of Galilee it was a woman and
another woman and another man who were
in The the Bedford corn Exchange in the
UK

shrieked and this man Jesus was there
