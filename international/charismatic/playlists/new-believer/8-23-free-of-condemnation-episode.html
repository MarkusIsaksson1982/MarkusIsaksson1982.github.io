Introduction
today you shall be free from the disgusting evil voice of condemnation the bible says you shall
know the truth and the truth shall set you free you will be free today because you know the truth and it says my people perish
because of lack of knowledge because of lack of understanding many of you have been perishing in this area because you just didn't know today you
will know the truth and you will be free it says in the bible in romans 8 verse 1
Romans 81
so now now there is no condemnation for those who belong to
christ jesus i like you joining along i think everybody should join along let's say that again let's get this in us right
now let's speak this truth so there is now no condemnation for
those who belong to christ jesus it doesn't say there's just not as much
it says there is no zero none for those who belong to christ
jesus so that means that if you believe that jesus is your savior
if you've accepted him as your lord and savior into your life by speaking with your lips jesus you are lord i give you
my life that's all you have to do some variation of saying it because what counts is your heart
not religious dictations amen but if you believe and speak with your heart jesus
i give you my life i believe you are my lord you belong to jesus
boom as simple as that you've become a child of god you belong to him if that's you
everybody here today then there is no condemnation for you so that means that
every kind of thought in your head every kind of voice in your head of
condemnation it means it's from the devil god can convict you god can god
can speak to you god can correct you but he will never condemn
you never so therefore you should never condemn yourself if you
are ever condemning yourself that means that you are agreeing with the devil
speaking condemnation to you one of the devil's biggest strategies to keep you
from knowing god's love and walking in god's power
is to speak the voice of condemnation to you hoping you'll believe it's god speaking
it to you and or hoping you'll believe it's your original thought and it's truth like
i'm bad i condemn myself god's probably mad at me god's
just probably disappointed in me i i'm so bad i'm such a bad person i'm
not a good enough christian i don't do enough i don't read the bible enough i don't pray enough that's all condemning
by the way the devil speaks this the war is in your mind and he's been at war with humanity with
this same voice of condemnation since the beginning with adam and eve in the beginning with adam eve when they disobeyed god the next thing he did was
drive condemnation in them they immediately saw they were naked the meaning that they saw they were naked
means that they had shame like i need to cover myself they didn't know what naked
was before then and that's why god says who told you you were naked
the meaning of that is you had no condemnation in you before you saw my love rightly for you and we
were so intimate you didn't see that you were naked you were bare before me you weren't afraid that i was going to judge
you or condemn you you were bare naked before me and didn't even know you were naked you were free you were living in
my love adam and eve thought it was god condemning them and they condemned themselves and so what happens is they
cover themselves and they hide now the bible says that the kindness of god is
what leads us to repentance in the passion translation it says romans 2 4
Romans 214
do you realize that all the wealth of his extravagance extravagant kindness is meant to melt your heart
and lead you into repentance the loving kindness that's void completely of
condemnation that leads you to repentance the only power you have the
only ability you have to be able to repent to desire to repent is when you
can accurately see god's loving kindness towards you
and say no to the voice of condemnation adam and eve could have been like god i need you and run towards him seeing him
rightly like how it speaks of the father of the prodigal son arm is wide open the prodigal son did so many bad things and
he was gone for so long and he spent his father's inheritance his fortune and he runs back as a prodigal son and the
father is like this arms wide open throws a party for him because he's coming back that's the heart of the
father and the father of the prodigal son it's so powerful when you read that story because he wasn't even like having
his arms crossed and welcoming him back he wasn't even like we need to have a talk first before i even let you back on
my property the father just knew that none of that was gonna help the son to repent he knew that the son needed to
see that he loves him regardless of what he's done and that is the only chance the son had to
be able to and desire to change his ways and this is my testimony i was a christian my whole life and i was
lukewarm and i put one foot in the world and i was doing the partying thing i was in college i still loved god and i went
to church twice a week every week and i love to talk about god and i would set
out with the intention to read the bible and spend time with god it never happened and i didn't know what was
wrong with me but i did hear a voice in my head all the time condemning me for not reading the bible for not setting
alone time one-on-one for god and what i've learned looking back is
that voice of condemnation never once helped me to repent
it didn't change me so then i encountered the power of god for the first time six years ago
and as i encountered his power that's like when i really met jesus because the kingdom of god is not a matter of talk
but a power the real jesus is not just hearing about him and being told you need to go read your
bible and being told that he's good but actually meeting him encountering him
tangibly in power so he's touching your heart tangibly and opening up your
spiritual eyes so that's what happened to me just one time in in the presence of god i'm seeing people healed
delivered i received a prophetic word that was so loving of god the one thing that he chose to speak through that
prophet was full of so much love and letting me know that he was near with me near to me it opened my eyes to who he
is like this love that i've never known before i immediately knew that my god was not a god of condemnation it wasn't
even a sermon or anything that led me to have this revelation it was meeting jesus
and i just knew all those voices in my head were never caught i just knew it because his love there's no way he could
condemn the kindness of god led me to repentance seeing his love and kindness
it's like i wanted to spend time with him i wanted to go in his word before you know that condemnation voice when
you even go to read the bible you're feeling condemned like you're not really hearing from him
it's just words he's not really speaking it's just quiet you know voices in your head like that
you can be condemning yourself as you're reading the bible or you spend time with god and you're condemning yourself the
whole time that you're talking to god you're not praying well enough you're not spending enough time in prayer i
used to hear this voice all the time you're not sitting alone in silence enough that's why you're not hearing anything i used to hear all those
condemning voices so no wonder me and many many of you maybe
and many other people in this world have a hard time reading the bible spending time with god because the devil's just condemning them
every moment that they even try to spend time with god because they don't know that it's the devil's voice they don't know to reject
that devil's voice so my eyes open and i've never been the same devil can't fool me anymore i know the truth and the
truth set me free hallelujah romans 8 31 this is nlt version if god is for us
Romans 831
who can ever be against us since he did not spare even his own son but gave up
for gave him up for us all won't he also give us everything else who dares accuse us whom god has chosen
for his own no one for god himself has given us right standing with himself
right standing that means he sees us as children his beloved children like the
father of the prodigal son no matter what he was doing you're still my child you're the righteousness of god i see
you as pure you're made in my image
who then will condemn us no one for christ jesus died for us and has
raised to life for us and was raised to life for us and he is sitting in the place of honor at god's right hand catch this
he is pleading for us god is for you pleading for you on your side god is
your biggest cheer leader if you are an olympic athlete training to win the
olympics and you hire the best trainer he is for you
and sometimes you might mess up but guess what he's for you even more get up
come on you're gonna win that's okay get up try again you're gonna do this i'm
cheering you on and and i mean if you're a olympic trainer that literally
helps you to win because you're hearing that voice cheering you on saying i'm
for you that leads you to repentance in a way if you're that olympic athlete and you mess up or you don't feel like
practice that day and you sleep in and you say i'm not practicing day or something the coach isn't going to be like well you're never going to win now
peace no he's for you he wants to see you one more than
anything he's like it's okay come on let's go let's go it's okay i don't condemn you let's go he's what he wants
to pep you up he wants to cheer you on he just wants to see you win he's not looking at your
faults every time that you mess up he's cheering you on even the more
even more god is well aware that you are in a spiritual war god is well aware that the devil's out
to get you so you better believe he's cheering you on
you better believe he has compassion and grace and understanding for you we tend
to forget that we beat ourselves up and we think god's condemning us when devil's the one making those
condemning voices and god is just saying i love you i love you i want you to win
i want you to fulfill the purpose that i that i've made for you no matter how much you've messed up look at his heart
for saul who became paul saul was making the biggest mess anyone could ever make of his life killing
christians but god was still for him he will accomplish what i created him to do on this earth
i'm fighting for him i'm cheering him on jesus is pleading for him god is full of mercy and grace and compassion for you
24 7 when you mess up when you miss the mark when you don't do good enough
his mercy and grace and compassion that's when it is there and most of the time the reason that christians sin and
just are not spending time with god like they should is literally because
they don't have this revelation that i i mean that was me that was me before i just needed the
revelation so don't you understand that god has compassion he's like i want my people
just need to see they need to know my love he's not condemning he knows your the
eyes aren't open he knows you need to know his love more so he's fighting for you more not
condemning you not pushing you away he's fighting for you more
and this is why the devil tries so hard with this condemnation way because this is what makes christians
stuck this is what makes christians not know god's love and this is what makes christians not actually fulfill their calling and be
powerful i am able to be full of peace and joy and be able to
confidently do what god's calling me to do because i know the truth that the
devil is the one sending those condemnation voices and god's never condemning me if i never knew that i
would not be here today the bible talks about the story of
this pharisee who was fasting and who was paying his tithes and he says oh lord i'm so glad that i fast all these
times i'm so glad that i tithe that i'm not like this tax collector but
then the tax collector is is coming with this pure heart and just turning to god with a pure heart so
it says luke 18 verse 13. so the tax collector says oh god be merciful to me for i am a
Luke 1818
sinner i tell you this i tell you this sinner not the pharisee returned home justified before god for
those who exalt themselves to be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted in the body of christ
this whole scenario happens a lot like a lot of people in the body of christ
think that to be spiritual think that the way to get anointing to be used powerfully by god is to be like that
pharisee it's not the way and that's why we see a powerless church by and large
it's not the way this religious way of when you fast a
certain amount when you pray this certain amount when you read this amount of the bible then you're spiritual
then you're to be looked up to then you'll walk it anointing it's not true god's looking at the heart
god's looking at your obedience the cost to carry anointing isn't that you spend five hours per day reading the
bible fasting and praying that's not the cost to carry anointing anybody can do that and you can be
rejected like the pharisee god will only choose you when you have a pure heart that you just want to please him and obey him whatever that looks like
that's how god chooses you then there's a cost the cost isn't being religious and spending five hours a day praying
fasting and reading the bible religiously that's not the cost to carry the anointing the cost is to obey god however he's
asking you to the cost is
allowing god to mold your heart to become more like his which happens through going through
trials where people are mean to you mistreat you speak bad things about you
publicly behind your back betray you but you you were with god in those moments you were in relationship in him in those
moments you're looking to him and you're saying lord how should i respond lord what should i do what should i say
what should i not say how do i respond loving here i want to please you i want to obey you
in this god that's relationship with god but many people live their lives throughout without this revelation and
they think only their time at home reading the bible and praying and praying and many times is doing it
religiously they're thinking that's the only time that they're spending with god that's a relationship with god is and
god's like yes you are holy now
when really it's about walking every moment with the holy spirit
and living to please him every single moment and being in communication with
every single moment not religious communication but aware that he's with you
and like when someone speaks to you you think how should i respond it's like you're having communication with god in
your mind you know like it's the spirit giving you power giving you ability you live in this revelation that the spirit
is guiding you and leading you that's relationship that's intimacy
you're in the car you're in the plane you're traveling around and you include god with you in that moment maybe you
don't even speak aloud but you bring him in that moment with you you start to thank him maybe you're not even speaking
but you're thanking him from the inside in your heart that's communication that's intimacy
that's relationship with god and then we need to bring that when you actually do spend time in the word when you do spend
time alone time praying to god that it's not religious like that pharisee but that it's real it's a real relationship
and you're not thinking to yourself oh god's judging me how i'm talking to him right now do i sound spiritual
that you're talking like you normally talk that you're not judging yourself
um am i doing this right am i spending enough time here listening i don't know but it's
natural and you're just spending time with god because you love him we've turned it to be weird as christians like
we say god is so loving but to spend time with him is hard it should be
something natural your husband your wife your best friend you want to spend time with them it's not a cost to spend time
with them but we're thinking so religiously that this is the this is how you get the anointing this
is the cost to spend time religiously with god it's wrong it's religion
and it's living in that voice of condemnation because you're never gonna match up you're not seeing god rightly full of
love wanting to spend time with you and wanting you to enjoy spending time with him
you're seeing it as okay i'm doing this so i can become more spiritual i'm doing this so i can be righteous i'm doing
this so i can get anointing but god's a person
god's your best friend god's the one who loves you the most spending time with him should be the
most fun thing to do in the world but when you're seeing it wrongly you're not you're not seeing it as fun you're
seeing it as something you don't want to do and that's what pushes people away from spending time with god at all hallelujah
Romans 812
romans 8 verse 2 it says and because you belong to jesus it belongs to him the power of the
life-giving spirit has freed you from the power of sin that leads to death god
has not made it hard to live a pure and blameless life he's not made it hard
to not sin to not live a sinful life he's made it easy
and simple if you live in this revelation that because you belong to him it says
it says because you belong to him the power of the life-giving spirit has freed you from the power of sin that
leads to death romans 8 9 says you are not controlled by your sinful nature you are controlled
Romans 829
by the spirit if you have the spirit of god living in you romans 8 15 you have not received a
Romans 815
spirit that makes you fearful slaves instead you received god's spirit when he adopted you as his own children now we call him abba father for his spirit
joins with our spirit to affirm that we are god's children
and so wow if we can live in this revelation i am god's child god loves me
god's for me he's cheering me on his spirit lives in me to help me to live to
please him i'm no longer a slave to sin jesus removed that that sinful nature no
longer controls me if you live in that revelation you will be amazed at how all of that
sin falls off your life and how god transforms you mightily that
now you're actually not even desiring the things of the flesh you're only desiring the things of the
spirit when you live in this revelation when you live in this revelation now the holy spirit can actually help you you're
actually inviting the holy spirit in to help you to not sin to help you to live to please god
but you see how this revelation is void of that condemnation holy spirit god is for me holy spirit's
in me helping me to live to please him and to never sin
holy spirit is more powerful than my flesh and he's living in me holy spirit's more powerful than the
devil trying to attack me and lie to me and try to tempt me with sin holy
spirit's more powerful and he's cheering me on he's not standing there judging me how are you gonna do today are you gonna
sin today but you're living with that revelation god is for me he knows there's a
spiritual war out there but he's cheering me on and he's gonna help me deny my flesh he's gonna help me say no
to all of that sin and live to please him abba father
that's the truth but how many of us don't live in that revelation and live thinking that god is watching
us are you gonna sin today are you gonna mess up today that's not god
when we live that way we're not inviting the holy spirit and to help us
you knowing this truth sets us free so now we can actually invite god in and live in this revelation i'm telling you
i've been amazed to see the transformation in my life from when i first received my calling when i was first baptized in the holy spirit and
that same year i received my calling i've been amazed to see just this ease of which i could live in
the spirit just this easy i wasn't having like come on deny my flesh
it wasn't like hard like that it was before i had this revelation before i had the baptism holy spirit before i
started to walk in the anointing the anointing is that oil that makes things come with ease
it was hard before but now that i'm where the anointing is i have the baptism holy spirit the fire to empower
me it's it's been easy
i do not desire the things of the world at all but it's not because i'm holier than thou it's not because oh yes i'm so good
i've denied my flesh it's because i walked in this revelation with the holy spirit helping me and
transforming me into his image so here number one we're going to go over areas of the condemnation where the
condemnation voice comes in there is no condemnation for you when you mess up
listen we are being transformed into the image of god it says in the bible we are being transformed
none of us are jesus yet right but i mean it's possible for us to look
a whole lot like him but we're not there yet we're all on different journeys
i was i did not look how i did six years ago i hope you wouldn't judge me though
six years ago right you know i'm just in a different journey i shouldn't judge myself six years ago
i'm in a different journey than maybe one of you was at six years ago for example we're all on different journeys
we're all being transformed by the spirit we sometimes we make mistakes the bible
says that god corrects those who he loves the bible doesn't say you mess up you're
done it says he corrects that means we'll mess up it'll happen as we're being transformed into his
image that's part of it we mess up god shows us this isn't the way i want you to go this
way instead i want you to notice this is not good what you did i have a better
way for you that leads to life now go this way that's the voice of
conviction remember that condemnation never leads
to repentance but conviction is when you're seeing god rightly the kindness of god leading you
to repentance so when you mess up you should see god rightly in that way saying this way is better my son my
daughter i'm correcting you right now this way is my way that way leads to death i want you to do this to please me
more that doesn't please me there but this pleases me but god's not saying it with
condemnation he's saying as a cheerleader wanting you to win cheering you on he's for you remember it says
that god is for us who can be against us god's for you you messed up that's okay we're gonna go this way i'm showing you
this way and so in that moment when we hear that conviction we also have to say no to the
condemnation voice because the devil will be on it when he sees you mess up i'm telling you as believers the devil's on it boom
condemnation voice he's on it so you have to be aware you need to reject those lies of the devil
you need to understand what's going on that's not god and god does not want you to condemn yourself because then you're agreeing with the devil you're being
like adam and eve and you're turning away from god that's not going to lead to repentance so if you really want to please god if
you really feel sorry about what you did reject those lies and see god rightly
and see him with his arms wide open and run to his arms so you can have the power to repent it's important to feel
sorry but not feel condemned that's how we repent correctly
i reject the voices of condemnation i remind myself this is how god is for me right now arms wide open not judging me
and then you just honestly be before god see him rightly with those eyes of full of love and compassion
those eyes of loving correction you know are and you say i'm sorry god
i really it makes me sad that i grieved your heart in any way if i grieved your heart in any way i just want to please
you lord help me to not do that again i only want to please you
be sorry but don't condemn yourself be sorry and run into his arms and
that's it and then we move on don't stay there don't stay there wallowing that you messed up but let it empower you
sometimes it's a good thing i've messed up before and i see it as it was a good thing because it made me more
intentional like oh this area i don't want to do that again so i'm going to make more intention
be serious about this so that i don't make that mistake again that's a good thing i can see the good how god turned
that into good amen so there's no condemnation when you mess up
if you ever mess up remind yourself there's no condemnation for me right now god doesn't even want me to have a bad
day god doesn't want me to feel sad god wants me to be full of peace and joy it's done god's helping me
he's cheering me on we're going forward not backward hallelujah number two there's no
No Condemnation
condemnation in your relationship with god never see
yourself as being judged by god with how you pray with how you read the bible
god wants him to be your closest friend so you need to look at him in that way that he is your very best friend he's
with you always and just like your very best friend is never judging you and your relationship together
god is never judging you and your relationship together and this is how we can be powerful vessels of god
we're powerful vessels of god because we know god's love and we live in god's
love and we want the world to know this amazing love because our eyes were once
blind we once condemned ourselves but now we know we know this amazing
love of god and so this is what fuels us this is what gives us strength and
passion to minister to people this is how we can see people with god's eyes god wants to heal you god wants to
deliver you this is how we can stand strong against all persecution because we know god's love we're living in god's
love and we want people to know god's love
that's all that it is so you can't be a powerful vessel of god if you're living in condemnation you don't actually know
god's love and you're not living in god's love so that a way to be an anointed vessel
of god is not to condemn yourself and say i need to pray and read the bible more i'm not being a good enough
christian i feel so desperate in this for you to know this because i used to be that way
and when i when i received the calling to be an apostle i was like what on earth
i'm not a real spiritual person i i believed those condemnation voices
so much those condemnation voices about my relationship with god that i thought god would never choose me for a big calling
like that so now i knew i was living in lies when i received that prophetic word it opened
my eyes i was living in lies a condemnation and so i'm here to tell you god wants to
use you mightily want to be an inspiration for you
i don't because i never heard this before the other preachings i heard there's
condemnation that comes through it many times because they don't have that revelation that i'm sharing with you today
so it's like you need to read the bible more you need to pray more you need to live right you need to stop sinning like
that was the the messages that i was hearing and so therefore i disqualified myself
completely to being used powerfully by god i did
so i'm telling you today if god can call me god can call you i don't want you to ever see me as some
unattainable super spiritual person god could use you too but you have to say no to those condemnation voices and live in
god's love receive his love for you amen i want to go into this
Be Aware
there is no condemnation in your mind the devil's speaking in your mind a lot
you need to be aware the bible says to be aware that because the devil's roaring around like a lion prowling
around like a lion seeking whom he can power he's in your mind seeking to devour you you have to be aware you have
to be on guard listen to this many thoughts that you have are not your
own original thoughts they come from the devil this is how many people have identity issues
because the devil comes with a strategic attack speaking you are this you are this you are this you are this you are
this this is what you like this is what you like this is what you like it's the devil planning those lies so many times trying
to make you think that just because you're hearing again and again in your mind that it is you this guy shared this
testimony joseph and this testimony he's sharing that he
heard a message of me it's just like a one message that one minute message that i spoke which is what i'm about to share with you right now
but listen to this testimony he says i watched this video this one minute video last year about 2021 december
ever since i watched this video i am set free from demons planting lies lustful
thoughts in my mind i thought i had a desire to speak bad words to someone and i thought i have a
desire to lust but i don't want to the demon was planning homosexual
thoughts in my mind since i was a child the demon since i was a child was like you are gay that's your identity
so i follow what came through my mind for long years believing that's who i am
but ever since i saw this video the truth set me free
hallelujah now i know already my real identity and while i'm continuing watching your
videos i started to know god's real voice he says you are my son
all the voice words that you hear inside your mind against yourself against others is not your voice
you have a beautiful heart like mine i cried a lot when i heard this prompting of the holy spirit
jesus is really talking to me a lot through you i'm even crying right now while typing praise god
hallelujah hallelujah so that's a sermon right there
that's a sermon right there he revealed what i was just sharing with you how the devil comes and the devil can come and
speak to you and say i don't like that person the devil can come and speak to you and
The Devil
say you should say this out loud about that person the devil can come to you and say you'll
never make it the devil can come to you and say you're not good enough you don't speak well enough
the devil can come to you and say you're not a good enough christian the devil can come
you to say limitless lies so many lies
but so many of you think it's your own original thoughts because we live in the world and that's what the world says
that whatever you're thinking whatever you're feeling that's you but the devil is the father of lies
and he comes in your mind making you think it is your original thought that
guy in that testimony shared how he was having these lustful thoughts he was having these thoughts of speaking bad
about people but he didn't want to do those things the devil will do that like you could have no desire to sleep with
someone to to hit on someone you know to do but the moment you see someone you
could hear lies that you should do that but you your heart is i want to please god and i don't i know that's not god's
will i don't want that so you have to be very aware that those thoughts coming through are not you
when you truly with your heart desire i want to please god this is what i want i want to be in his will that's the real
you that's the real you and so those other thoughts that come in
and those other feelings that come in you can have jealous feelings but you already vowed to god lord i want
to love everybody i want to support everybody like you i don't want to be jealous that's
you but the devil will come and speak those things he'll give you those feelings
you need to understand that's not you if you think it's you oh boy you will be so condemning yourself that's what comes
next that's why the devil puts those thoughts in there that's why because he doesn't want you to know god's love and
know that you have control over yourself he wants to control you
and fill you with condemnation and make you think that god's so disappointed of you and you're not a good christian when your heart that's
why it's god's all about the heart god's all about the heart
hallelujah so you have to be aware like every feeling you get every thought that you
get that doesn't align with god's will you need to understand that's not you
you are that's why god says you are the righteousness of god you are pure
that's who you are that's your identity you are a child of god you are made in
my image and the devil is trying to form you into something that you are not do
not believe his lies and how do you do this the bible says ii corinthians 10 5 we demolish arguments
we demolish arguments of the devil coming as feelings and thoughts we demolish them
and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of god
did you hear that we demolish arguments of the devil and every
pretension from the devil that sets itself up against the knowledge of god who god says i am
god's will for my life we demolish them and we take captive
every thought to make it obedient to christ this scripture reveals to us that many
of your thoughts are from the devil it says we take every we take captive
every thought so this is how you
get rid of those stupid voices in your head those voices going against who you
are in christ and those voices of condemnation you demolish them you take them captive
so we have to see the devils lies in our mind like they are criminals
and we need to be policemen and women we need to take it so seriously this is serious business
and we need to take them and make them prisoners that's how we do it when you do that can speak it aloud i reject that
thought i do not have those desires to go after that person i am a child of god
i am pure i do not have dirty thoughts i have pure thoughts i have the mind of
christ i love that person i do not want bad for that person i love that person i
take captive that thought right now that says i want that person to not succeed
that i'm jealous of that person these desires i have to sin specific
desires they are not my desires these thoughts i take those thoughts captive
i have the desire only to please god to live holy to live in his will speak it aloud
take captive the thoughts from the devil and speak aloud god's truth that's how you win the spiritual war
and eventually those lies are going to get out of you like completely i don't live with voices of condemnation
i'll see the devil strategically come once in a while but he never wins
but i've seen such amazing transformation where you know it says resist the devil and i'll flee from you
so i've seen that when i've done this spiritual work i've seen the results of it i've seen
hallelujah i live so free in my mind where i don't have to deal with these constant lies in my head anymore
because the devil had to flee i wasn't letting him stay i resisted him and i took them all captive and made him
prisoners to christ amen so there is no condemnation when you
Dreams
mess up when you make a mistake there is no condemnation in your relationship with god your life as a believer
there is no condemnation in your mind the thoughts and feelings you're having there's no condemnation
and number four there is no condemnation from the dreams you've had the world
will say that all your dreams come from your imagination but the devil likes to send dreams too god sends dreams some
dreams might be your imagination and some dreams are sent from the devil
there are some people that have literal bondage in their dreams where they need freedom they need the anointing to
destroy the yoke and send a spiritual spouse out that's sleeping with them for example again and again and again
there's some people that have recurring nightmares horrifying nightmares they need deliverance
and then there's all of us believers who will face these attacks from the devil
where once in a while the devil will come in your dreams and the biggest scheme i've seen of the
devil it'll be different for other all people some the devil might uh try to bring fear in your dreams for me i've
seen the strategy of condemnation in my dreams where and and this never happened until
i started walking in my anointing and so this is why i know this scheme of condemnation
god wants us to be free from condemnation we have to be free from condemnation because if we are not free from condemnation we cannot love fully
we are not living in the revelation of god's love so we cannot love people well
but when we are knowing god loves me that's when we can love people the best
and so i saw that i never had these types of dreams these condemnation dreams until i stepped into the anointing
and ever since then it's it's been once in a while the devil will come with
this dream with this scheme and he'll come in my dreams and he will send me dreams of me doing bad things in
my dream that i have no desire doing it all he can send sexual dreams i have no desire doing that at all and in the
dream i will feel trapped i will feel like my flesh is controlling me and that is never me in real life
and in my dream i will feel condemnation the dream can feel real and i will feel
i will be condemning myself and you wake up feeling condemning wake up condemning yourself the devil's
scheme is to make me think that that dream is my dream was really me and my dream that's the devil's scheme that's a
sneaky way of trying to bring condemnation trying to make me think to condemn myself that it was really me and
then walk in that condemnation your dreams are not you you need to understand the scheme of the devil that
he will have you doing bad things sinful things in your dreams for the specific purpose of hoping
you'll condemn yourself not even to try to get you to desire to do that or something it's literally to get you to
condemn yourself because you think it's really you so you need to wake up and reject that dream you need
to wake up every time this is what i do i wake up i'm groggy i say i reject that dream and that's it and i don't allow it
to come back in my mind i know that i resist the devil and he'll flee from me so i say i reject the dream and i have
peace i know oh the devil's mad he's trying again he lost because i rejected that dream
and now i'm living about my life with jesus with that in the past don't allow that dream to come in your memory
throughout the day you rejected it it's gone and now move on with jesus the devil's defeated immediately
hallelujah i feel the freedom this is what god wants us to be just bursting with his peace and joy and his love
we can't have the heaviness of condemnation anymore we can't have the heaviness of shame and
guilt we can't carry that it's time it ends now and this is rare y'all this is rare and
the body of christ a lot of people are bound with this condemnation
and god's counting on us all to speak the truth
and to be overflowing with love like no one's ever seen because they're still bound with condemnation
so that they can be free too as god moves through you powerfully with the love that's flowing through you when you
have the this revelation you will love people so well because you know god doesn't condem
so you don't even have like judgmental thoughts about anybody you don't you're seen with the mind of
god now god doesn't condem there's no condemnation and so even when someone wrongs you you
don't condem you don't judge there's no kind of nation in christ jesus
we're not called to condemn anybody so now it's just flowing out of us because we're living in the truth of
christ amen hallelujah hallelujah praise god
