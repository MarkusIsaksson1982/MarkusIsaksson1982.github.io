how to pray the Jesus way a couple of
Sundays ago I shared a message how to
have intimacy with God how to be a
friend of God and I'm going to be going
deeper into really how to pray how to
pray the right way a way that is
pleasing to God a way that is not
religious the Jesus way
amen it says in Matthew 9:14 one day the
Disciples of John the Baptist came to
Jesus and asked him why don't your
disciples fast like we do and the
Pharisees do Jesus replied do wedding
guests mourn while celebrating with the
groom of course not I'm going to fast
forward to the um I'm going to fast
forward uh to verse
17 who would patch old clothing with new
cloth for the new patch would shrink and
rip away from the old cloth leaving an
even bigger tear than before and no one
puts new wine into old wine skins for
the old skins would burst from the
pressure spilling the wine and ruining
the Skins new wine is stored in new wine
skins so that both are
preserved now the reason that Jesus
talks about um old wine versus new wine
right
after I mean I mean as a response to to
uh to the Disciples of John the Baptist
asking this question why don't your
disciples fast like we do and the
Pharisees do the reason being was
because Jesus was answering them you are
fasting and
praying you were because they go
together you are fasting and praying in
the old wine
way in a religious
ritualistic
traditional
way and I Jesus is saying I'm coming I
have come to bring new wine I have come
to destroy
religion and to show you my
way the way that leads to true
life so he's saying now I am teaching my
disciples how to pray and fast in the
new wine way non-religious non
ritualistic new wine wine way this new
wine way has
power it is not dead like religion it
has power and the new wine way is the
holy spirit Le
way because when we when I talk about
religion I'm talking about when you see
the Pharisees the Pharisees were
interpreting the word of God one way and
so they were if it was the same word of
God that they were reading that Jesus
was teaching
from teaching his disciples it's the
same word of God right but the Pharisees
had and and John the Baptist didn't have
the right
Revelation they didn't have the Jesus
Revelation Jesus hadn't come yet they
had old wine
Revelation religious
Revelation so
them them following the word of God was
done in this way of
rituals as a way to earn acceptance from
God like I'm doing this to to check the
boxes off of on this list here so that I
can perform a certain way that reaches
the bar
so now I'm righteous so now I'm
acceptable by
God that's what religion
is it's not
personal it's about rituals it's about
performance it's about checking things
off of the
list this is what Jesus was bringing
them out
of Jesus was bringing them into the new
wine which is led by the Holy Spirit
not based on tradition and
rituals but in relationship with God
Amen
so
religion has become so prevalent again
in the body of
Christ Jesus helped the people of God
get away from
religion those that would accept him the
IES wouldn't accept him and they stayed
in religion but those who accepted him
he helped them get out of religion But
as time has gone on the enemy has tried
to really bring back religion in the
church blinding people with
religion you know some of these
testimonies that we heard today we heard
many people be delivered of religion
they were describing it as like they
they were doing things in their own
effort they were just trying to do the
right things and not not ever measuring
up you know not ever feeling like they
were a good enough
Christian that's the heaviness of
religion um the reality is that God is
full of
love he is full of understanding he is
full of compassion he is full of
mercy and he's a real
person he is not a
statue and he's not like an
alien We Like We Are Made In His
Image he's relatable if that makes
sense so um like if you are a parent and
you have a child a young child you're
not lording over them this list of
things they must do and if they do this
and this and this and this then you say
you're okay I'll give you a smile now a
on the
back
right no you are that that's how
religion is but rather the parent is
after the heart the parent the parent
knows the CH the child won't be perfect
they're not expecting them to be
perfect but they want the they want
there to be character built in this
child they want the child to do their
best they they want the child just to
have a good
heart right but if they mess up they're
like of course you mess up you're a kid
there's no kid in the history of the
earth that's been like perfect that's
like acted like an adult when they're a
child you know what I mean so there's
the the full of grace a parent has for
their child and this parent wants the
best for their child the parent sees the
best in their child and the parent loves
their child more than they love
themselves they love them more than
anything in the world
right so that's how God is towards you
but a jillion times
more there's not even a number because
we can't comprehend Millions times
trillions times billions times
more so you see the
difference God is Not judging you
judging how you have a relationship with
him judging how you pray judging if
you've checked every box on the list
off he's after your heart looking at
your
heart and he's cheering you on and he's
wanting the best for
you before you learn how to pray the
right way you need to be seen God
rightly
seeing how God sees
you so whenever you think of God you
need to be thinking of him of his
amazing love and compassion for
you of of how he wants the best for you
of how he sees the best in you you
that's that's the the the core of being
able to pray in a way that's pleasing to
God is to see him
rightly he's a person not a
statue he's a
person
amen and so so many people they they um
they think that if they
pray religious sounding prayers Rel
spiritual sounding prayers lofty using
lofty words they wouldn't normally use
and pray for several
hours um they think that that is what is
touching God's heart
but that that is actually so much
performance do you
see in the relationship you have with
people on this Earth that you love the
most you are not out to impress them
with the
with with an with an impressive
vocabulary are you are you you know your
best friend or your spouse are you are
you spending hours studying a glossery
to impress them with how you speak to
them the words you use the
vocabulary are you setting a timer I
must speak two hours to them and then
they'll love
me but you know God is a real
person and the less we treat him as a
real person the less the more we treat
him as a robot or
something not a person
sin the more we're not going to love him
the more we're not going to want to
spend time with him the more difficult
it will be to spend time with him the
more you'll be listening to the enemy's
lies of
condemnation lies that God is upset with
you disappointed with you you'll never
be a good enough
Christian right so this is so important
that we are seeing God rightly we're
seeing him as a real person
Matthew 18:3 says and he said truly I
tell you unless you change and become
like little children you will never
enter the kingdom of
heaven now becoming like little children
Jesus is saying Jesus is Jesus is saying
this to you unless you become like
little children you will not enter the
Kingdom of
Heaven you will not receive
the the the Abundant Life that
comes with entering in the Kingdom of
Heaven you will not receive the healing
the Deliverance the Miracles The Joy the
peace the experiencing the intimacy that
comes with entering in the Kingdom of
Heaven unless you become like little
children now this means being
teachable being humble
this is the big meaning of becoming like
little
children but that's not all he's also
speaking about your relationship with
him some of you are struggling so you
you you're struggling so much to have a
relationship with God you're struggling
in prayer you're struggling feeling like
I don't know how to have a relationship
with God I don't know how to pray I feel
like I'm doing it wrong I I feel like
I'm not saying enough words I feel like
I'm not praying long
enough but God says that children are
the ones that enter the kingdom of
heaven so that shows us that to
pray even a child can
do to
pray and to have relationship with God
is so
simple that a child can do
it and this scripture actually teaches
us so much about
prayer that it's not supposed to be so
complicated that we're not supposed to
go in prayer to God seeing him as this
um
professor at Harvard of English or
something or the president of the United
States or something like we we don't
have to feel so out of
place and so
inadequate a child can be friends with
God a child can pray it's a God and when
a child prays god loves the prayer
amen
hallelujah you need to stop judging your
prayers to God you need to stop judging
your relationship with God you need to
stop listening to those lies of the
devil because I'm telling you prayer is
really so simple you can do it in a way
that pleases
God hallelujah
praise
God 1 Corinthians 14:15 says so what
shall I do I will pray with my spirit
but I will also pray with my
understanding I will also pray with
my
understanding I will pray with
my
understanding the prayer that God is
looking for is praying with
understanding if you're praying
religiously like the Pharisees did
you're not praying with the
understanding of who Jesus
is you're not praying with the
understanding that it's not rituals and
fancy prayers and really long prayer
sessions that are just full of empty
words that pleases
God praying with understanding means
that God is looking for Faith like a
child a relationship with him that a
child can
have praying with understanding means
understanding of who God
is so that when you pray with him you
know who you're talking to the most
loving person in the whole
world who loves you more than anybody in
this world who wants the best for you
who loves spending time with you who is
never judging you or condemning
you praying with that
understanding the understanding of of of
of God's
heart the understanding as I shared a
couple weeks ago the understanding that
God's whole heart is his
people is for his kingdom to advance
is for his people to know him is for his
people to be healed to be delivered for
the works of the devil to be destroyed
in people's lives that's God's biggest
passion so to know who you're talking
to to know what his heart is and to
speak to him
accordingly and to walk with him
accordingly in your daily life which
means in your obedience serving him
you're partnering with him that's
intimacy that's relationship
sh so so many times people think
relationship with God is about these
like long prayer sessions lofty
prayers that are empty words that are
just based on ritual and
performance when meanwhile God isn't
there God's not in the
religion God's in his kingdom
business and God's asking you to obey
him God's asking you to serve him God's
asking you to work with him partner with
him God's asking you to be a vessel of
him God's asking you to align with his
heart his heart of passion Fierce
passion for his
people pray with
understanding so when you're praying in
the religious way you're not praying
with
understanding that's not intimacy you're
missing
God it's not touching God's heart
you prayed for several hours these empty
words but meanwhile what have you done
to touch his heart what have you done
for his
kingdom what have you done in
partnership with
him
amen Hebrews 11:6 says and without faith
it is impossible to please God because
anyone who comes to him must believe
that he exists and that he rewards those
who earnestly seek him without faith it
is impossible to please
God so that also means that the way to
please
God is to have faith if you want to
please God you have to have
faith so praying with understanding a
big meaning of that is is to pray with
faith
and so many times people think that the
more you pray the more you repeat the
same thing over and over
again the more God will hear your prayer
the more likely he'll
move but it's really the opposite of
that because God's not dumb hilarious
obviously
not he's the smartest person in the
world
it sounds ridiculous to say
it but but
really do you repeat something a million
times to your friends to your
spouse if you did they would say do you
think I'm dumb I heard you do you think
I'm not listening so that's why I say
God's not
dumb God's not
deatha God hears you
and so it's it's really not spiritual
it's really not praying with
understanding of of of how powerful God
is to repeat things over and over
again to to think okay I'm not seeing
this thing happen in my life yet that
must mean I need to spend more hours in
prayer repeating the same thing over and
over again or that must mean I need to
pray or I need to fast for days
now that's not spiritual
because it's not
rituals that move the hand of God the
heart of God it's
Faith it's faith
and and going according to God's
ways like it's the anointing that
destroys the
Yoke so so many people are you know
they're seeing this revival they're seen
God move in power but they don't want to
let go of religion I've heard people
many times say you don't need to go to
that Revival
event you don't need a person to pray
for you you can just receive the miracle
right where you're
at that's
religion that's living without
understanding of God and his
ways because the it's the anointing that
destroys the Yoke the Bible says and
God's ways of releasing his anointing is
through vessels through his
servants and so to pray with
understanding when it comes to praying
for miracles to happen and seeing the
miracles happen in your life it means to
to request give God your
request and then locate where he is
moving in power where you
access what you have requested
for and then you actually move you go
you position yourself where the power of
God's moving and that's how you receive
the
miracle so there's people that want to
hang on to
religion and they're missing out on
their miracles
they're they're praying and praying and
praying and praying and fasting and
fasting and fasting and fasting and
trying to do many things in effort and
performance and they're not seeing any
Miracles take place in their
life they're not praying with
understanding they are praying and
fasting in the old wine way like the
Pharisees and like the Pharisees they
are missing out on touching God's heart
on entering the kingdom of heaven on
receiving miracles from
Jesus so the proper way to pray with
understanding is to make your request to
God and believe that he is heard
you and
believe that he has the power to release
this miracle to you and believe that he
is so good and so loving that he for
sure wants to to bless you with this
it's just about his
timing to believe his word that speaks
about how you have an inheritance from
God a co-inheritance with
Jesus a belief in the word of God that
by his stripes you are
healed Bel in the word of God that the
devil has come to steal kill and destroy
John 1010 but I have come that you would
have Abundant
Life so you
rest you rest and you you go find where
to access what you have requested for
requested
for f go where his anointing is go where
his power is and receive what you have
prayed
for that's how you pray with
understanding and receive what you've
prayed
for
Hallelujah those are the kinds of
prayers that touch God's
heart you know you're you you're you're
you're you're resting in
him you're believing in him you're
believing in his love for you and his
power and his ways you believe in his
anointing you believe even his
word that's how your prayer life should
be it's very simple isn't
it it's very
simple even a child can do
that
hallelujah praise
God James 4:2
says you want what you have don't have
so you scheme and kill to get it you are
jealous of what others have but you
can't get it so you fight and wage war
to take it away from them yet you don't
have what you want because you don't ask
God for it I'm going to read this part
again yet you don't
have what you want because you don't ask
God for it and even when you ask you
don't get it because your motives are
all wrong you want only what will give
you
pleasure now the scripture says yet you
don't have what you want because you
don't ask God for
it and so the
religious Revelation the wrong
revelation of this is God can never do
anything until I ask for it or I need to
keep asking and keep asking and keep
asking but the real newwind revelation
of this is you have not because you have
not asked with
understanding the current of Heaven is
Faith the currency to receive from God
is
Faith you know like the Pharisees are
doing they're doing so many commands
that are in the Bible but they're not
receiving they're not receiving the the
Miracles the healing the freedom the
things from
God because they're not praying with
understand understanding because they're
not praying with the right kind of
Faith but in
religion so
you know you can you can it's it's like
the example I just gave there are people
who are praying day and night for many
hours they're praying for certain
Miracles they're praying for miracles
for their family they're praying for
things to happen and they're fasting for
weeks and they're going to all night
prayer rooms and everything but they're
not getting
anything because they are not asking
with
understanding they are not praying the
right way they are not praying with
faith they are not praying the Jesus
way they are not doing what is necessary
to receive your prayer requests that
you've
asked
amen God is not impressed with your
rituals
he's impressed by your obedience and
your
faith I repeat God is not impressed with
your
rituals he's impressed by your obedience
and your
faith
Hallelujah so keep that in your
heart and that will be your compass of
how to
pray the Jesus
way this is just a taste of this
teaching that the Lord is leading me
leading me to share with you about how
to
pray I'm going to continue with this
next
Sunday I'm going to be teaching you why
prayers aren't effective and how to have
effective prayers that touch God's heart
even
more
amen
hallelujah so
get ready for next Sunday do not miss
this word hallelujah the rest of this
word praise God praise God
hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you
Jesus
