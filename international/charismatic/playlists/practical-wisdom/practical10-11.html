0:00
a lot of Christians are literally know
0:02
it alls on hearing God's voice when God
0:06
called me when I received the prophecy
0:08
that I was called to be an apostle I was
0:10
shocked because I didn't see myself as
0:14
that spiritual I thought something was
0:17
wrong with me because I felt like I
0:19
wasn't hearing God how other people were
0:21
hearing God I knew I had a relationship
0:24
I knew I heard from God but in
0:26
comparison to many people around me God
0:30
told me this God told me this God told
0:31
me this God told me this constantly and
0:33
for me it was much more that still Small
0:36
Voice many days it wasn't God saying
0:39
anything wild or crazy he's always
0:41
speaking over us we just have to open
0:43
our ears but the big thing he's speaking
0:45
over us all the time is I love you I'm
0:47
proud of you my promises are yes and
0:49
amen keep going I'm with you and the
0:53
simple Direction he spoke to you that's
0:55
the direction a lot of people are
0:57
thinking he's speaking turn right turn
0:58
left turn right turn left turn right
1:00
turn right turn right turn left turn
1:01
right turn left turn right when God's
1:03
saying do this and he's saying this word
1:06
for like months or
1:09
years sometimes like a significant
1:11
direction and each day it hasn't changed
1:14
it's straight go straight go straight A
1:17
lot of people they kind of want God to
1:19
be more like entertaining or more
1:21
exciting and so they think directions
1:23
are going to happen like this and they
1:24
want God to speak go go do this go do
1:27
that go do this sometimes they overp
1:28
spiritualize things like
1:30
God's telling me to go turn on the news
1:32
now God's telling me to go make
1:35
breakfast now um God's telling me to go
1:38
to bed at
1:40
10:14 overs spiritualizing things
1:42
because they want to feel like God is
1:45
this talkative giving all these
1:47
different directions all the time we got
1:48
to be careful about that number one that
1:51
we're not trying to like manipulate God
1:53
to be a different way than he is then
1:55
we're opening up doors for the angel of
1:58
Light to come s sing like God and
2:00
speaking a direction that is the
2:02
opposite of what God wants but not not
2:04
just that but even our own imagination
2:06
it can sometimes not even be the devil
2:08
but your own imagination is creating
2:11
things that you think God is is saying
2:14
that can be distracting us from staying
2:16
that course instead of like going like
2:18
this and being one step closer every day
2:20
to the promised land and going glory to
2:22
glory and just being perfectly in God's
2:24
Will and passing every test so that God
2:28
can pour out the powerful anointing in
2:29
your life and instead of this we
2:32
are like
2:34
this and we're having fun life's
2:38
exciting with our spiritual
2:41
encounters but we're going nowhere we're
2:43
missing the Glorious Abundant Life God
2:46
has for us walking in his purpose and
2:47
touching his heart and pleasing him it's
2:49
this balance of being very confident in
2:52
certain things that God has spoken to
2:54
you but then a big part of you is a baby
2:57
there's so much for me to learn and I
2:59
think God might be speaking this but I'm
3:01
not sure that's good that's a good place
3:03
to be that's not a bad place to be when
3:05
certain areas you're not sure about some
3:08
things that means that you are still
3:10
growing you are disciple you are student
3:12
you shouldn't know everything you should
3:14
not be a know it all
