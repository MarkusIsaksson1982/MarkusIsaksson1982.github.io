In Jesus's hometown, his hometown is the
0:03
only time recorded in the Bible where he
0:05
couldn't do many hardly any miracles.
0:09
And the reason was was because of lack
0:11
of faith. Not just that God could do
0:13
miracles, but so much having to do with
0:15
lack of faith that God was actually
0:18
using Jesus, this
0:21
man, young man, 30 years old, that they
0:25
grew up with. They didn't see angel
0:29
wings coming from him ever,
0:32
you know. They they they just saw him as
0:34
a normal person his whole life. They did
0:38
life with him. They went to school with
0:40
him. They worked with him. They saw him
0:41
around. Hi, Jesus. You know, like any
0:44
other person.
0:46
Now, Jesus is so is is is is so
0:49
transformed. He's walking in miracles.
0:51
And to them, it's really difficult for
0:55
them to see him differently, for them to
0:57
see him in the spiritual realm. God had
1:00
to bring Abram to a different land and
1:03
change his name to be Abraham to fulfill
1:05
the purpose of his life. A big reason
1:08
was because the people surrounding him
1:10
wouldn't be able to see who God called
1:13
him to be because they were so they had
1:15
ingrained in their mind his old self.
1:18
You have to be spiritual to see
1:20
spiritual spiritually. I mean, you have
1:23
to be and and the humble, pure in heart,
1:26
they're the ones whose eyes open up.
1:28
Humility and purity is rare today. This
1:31
principle is the same today. You're
1:33
going to find this principle to be the
1:35
same in every servant of God. probably
1:38
every servant of God, it's most of a lot
1:41
of their family members
1:43
and friends they grew up with, they they
1:46
really struggle to see them spiritually
1:48
and can't even receive through from
1:50
them. Maybe at least at first, maybe as
1:53
time goes by, they change, but they're
1:55
usually going to be way slower to
1:57
change. That's how it is with every
1:59
servant of God and every believer that
2:01
same principle. So it's very out there,
2:03
out of the box and more difficult to
2:06
accept just like in the times of Jesus.
2:08
Um and so but a big reason why that is
2:11
so I'm I'm reaching I mean God's using
2:14
me to reach people who didn't know me
2:16
before.
2:17
But a big reason is people they they see
2:20
you as Abram.
2:22
It's very hard for them to see as
2:23
Abraham unless they are spiritual,
2:26
humble in heart, pure in heart. A big
2:28
part of it is pride. Why are you so
2:30
special? They might think, "Why do you
2:32
receive all these miracles? I've been to
2:34
church. I know church. I've been to
2:35
church all my life." And it's so rare
2:37
what God's doing now. So they have in
2:39
their minds like, "Well, most of
2:41
Christianity, this is how it's done. And
2:44
you're coming with something new you're
2:46
sharing about. What is this? Who are
2:48
you? I grew up with you.
2:50
You're not anybody special. You're just
2:53
like me." That's how people are.
2:55
Especially when there's pride in their
2:56
hearts. And if there's jealousy, they
2:58
can see your light shining. they can see
3:00
you're blessed.
3:02
Jealousy can come and it distorts their
3:04
view even more. You know the jealousy
3:06
like gives them reason to reject you.
3:09
When jealousy is there, hate then
3:11
follows. So that's why you find people
3:13
being hateful towards you for no reason.
3:15
Doesn't make sense. Like what did I do
3:16
to them? Right? It's spiritual. It's
3:19
what a person has allowed in their
3:20
heart. The jealousy then leads to
3:22
hatred. So all that to say, don't take
3:25
it personal. It's okay. We all go
3:28
through that. I'm pretty sure most of
3:30
you here have a very similar testimony
3:34
and don't get bent out of shape about it
3:37
because then your light will dwindle.
3:40
Don't get down about it. Um for the
3:42
family members that it grieves you, the
3:44
friends that it grieves you because you
3:45
want them to experience what you've
3:47
experienced. Just rest. Rest. Rest in
3:51
God. Don't take that burden on yourself.
3:54
Trust him. Do your part of shining your
3:57
light and planting seeds and meeting
3:59
them where they are. Love them where
4:01
they are at. Be attractive in terms of
4:04
how you love with gentleness, with
4:05
kindness. And you are planting seeds
4:08
that will for sure come to harvest. They
4:11
will for sure come to harvest.
4:13
Hallelujah.
4:15
And so, you know, we we pray, we we say
4:18
this anointing that's coming upon my
4:20
life, may it go to my family members.
4:23
May it touch them. And honestly, when
4:26
you have that heart and you pray in that
4:28
prayer of understanding, spiritual way,
4:30
God moves upon that. That that anointing
4:33
is definitely coming and touching your
4:34
family and friends. And the harvest,
4:36
maybe it'll be several years from now,
4:38
but it's working. God is working. God is
4:41
working. And God can touch them in ways
4:44
that surprise you. Maybe you so badly
4:45
want them to come to your church where
4:47
you're at, where you've received, but
4:49
maybe they're so resistant to it. But
4:51
God can use some other random believer
4:54
and and and they're able to receive
4:56
through them and that becomes a seed.
4:59
Many of you became saved without
5:01
experiencing the power of God, right?
5:03
God still can use other other believers
5:07
who aren't carrying the power of God yet
5:09
and don't have all the revelation. God
5:12
can still be planting seeds. So God has
5:14
all these ways he can move. Um we we
5:17
tend to be like single minded like they
5:20
must come to my church and receive this
5:22
anointing. But just rest
5:26
you know they have free will. Believe
5:28
God's working. rest and allow God to to
5:33
do his
