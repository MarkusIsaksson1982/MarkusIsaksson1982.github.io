0:00
This good news has to get out. It has to get out. All of these
0:07
testimonies, which are just a fraction of what God is doing in his true revival that is now, this word has to get out.
0:18
We can't keep quiet about our Jesus and what he's doing.
0:25
It says in Romans 10:13, "For everyone who calls
0:30
on the name of the Lord will be saved and they will be healed and they will be delivered and they will be set on fire
0:36
and they will receive abundant life." But how can they call on him to save
0:41
them unless they believe in him? And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him?
0:49
This is this is the Bible saying this. This is the Bible. How can they believe
0:55
in him if they have never heard about him? How can they receive deliverance
1:02
if they have never heard about Jesus delivering people? How?
1:09
They can't. That's the point of you have to hear to believe.
1:15
It's when people hear the good news that they believe and they receive Jesus.
1:23
How will people hear if you're afraid of persecution to spread the good news? If
1:28
you're afraid of what people will think about you, how will they hear? How will they be free?
1:34
Oh, it is worth it. It is worth any kind of persecution.
1:40
It is worth losing your ego. It is worth having enemies and haters
1:47
to speak the good news that will set people free and lead them to Jesus, lead them to salvation.
1:54
It is worth it. We have to get this good news out.
2:00
People of God, how many people are in LA? Several
2:07
million. I think it's is it four million almost? What? 11 million.
2:14
11 million people are in LA 11 million.
2:22
How many of those people know Jesus? How many of those people are bound? How many of those people have heard of Jesus? Are
2:28
Christians going to churches with no power and are bound by demons in this city alone?
2:36
Many of them. Many.
2:42
Oh, it's time to have urgency in your heart, people of God.
2:48
Revival army, [Applause]
2:55
do you hear what God is doing just this week? We have to have a long
3:02
service here because to give God glory, we need all this time, adequate glory. We have
3:09
there's so many testimonies. We short service. [Applause]
3:15
Hallelujah. This is just a fraction. This is just a fraction. There's people
3:21
part of this revival all around the world. More than 160 nations, they're a part of it. And so, look at us around
3:28
here. Look at look around. This is small. The pe the testimony shared today. This is small even.
3:34
But even if it was just this is mindblowing. Even if it was just five testimonies,
3:41
this this doesn't happen often. Many people are bound by these things for their life, their whole life, and they
3:48
don't know how they can be free. They don't know how to be free. We have to get the word out, people of God. We have
3:54
to get the word out. Hallelujah.
4:01
I feel the Holy Spirit impressing this urgency.
4:07
How can they believe in him if they have never heard about him? And how can they hear about him unless
4:15
someone tells them? Who will tell them? You.
4:24
God is counting on you to tell them.
4:29
And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them? And how will anyone go and tell them without being sent?
4:35
That is why the scriptures say, "How beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news?"
4:41
God is sending you out. I commission you as your spiritual leader, spiritual mother. I commission you to go out
4:50
and spread this good news. I commission you to go out and pray for
4:56
the sick and those oppressed like we've heard has been happening in
5:02
Colorado. I commission you. I give you permission. I send you out.
5:10
[Music] Share this good news. We have to get the word out.
5:18
This is too small. We are too small. right now
5:25
compared to the city of LA there's so millions of people oppressed
5:32
come on we have we have to take it up a notch the fire we have to have more
5:37
urgency hallelujah and in this new phase of revival this is
5:43
what God is speaking it's time to go out with passion with fire with boldness
5:49
with urgency see with sacrifice and full surrender to God. It's time to have
5:57
compassion for the people out there who have not yet received what you have
6:02
received. And it's time to have passion for them to receive our Jesus, this
6:08
anointing, and step into revival.
6:13
I'm fired up because I I we heard the testimony of what just sharing the good
6:19
news, just getting out there and spreading flyers. We heard the testimony today. It works. Every seed you sew, God
6:27
moves upon it. He moves upon every seed you sew.
6:33
God's saying, "It's up to you. I've released this revival to you here
6:39
in LA. I've released it to you. Now it's up to you to steward it. Now it's up to you to
6:45
share this good news and bring people in. Sheep produce sheep.
6:52
Sheep produce. You as sheep are to produce more sheep. That's your job.
6:59
This is what the scriptur is saying. How will they hear if they're not told? That means that God isn't going to just speak
7:05
in an audible voice, "Revival is now from the heavens.
7:11
go to 5F Church to encounter God's power. No, this scripture shows us that he
7:17
commisss us to go and spread the good news and they won't hear unless we tell
7:24
them. Hallelujah.
7:30
It's time to go and evangelize, to go and share this good news with all
7:37
of your heart. PE people aren't here because they haven't
7:44
heard, not because they don't want Jesus. Do you know how many people want freedom? They just don't know that it's
7:50
here for them. The harvest is ripe. Come on, laborers. It's time to go out.
7:58
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
8:03
So, I'm I I'm I'm going to I want to teach today now that God is really speaking this with urgency to go out and
8:10
spread this good news with all of your heart. I want to teach you today how to represent Jesus rightly as you go out.
8:18
How to shine your light accurately with excellence. Not just any old way, but
8:24
how to be the most effective to share this good news so that people will be
8:29
attracted and want to come and receive Jesus. Amen.
8:34
Hallelujah.
8:40
So in the kingdom of God, there must be balance.
8:46
There must be balance. It's this is a kingdom principle that there must be balance. By this I mean here's one
8:53
example. I'm going to give you some examples of how you must have balance. So we must ask God for the desires of
9:00
our heart. The Bible says you have not because you have not asked. You need to knock on the door. You need
9:07
to seek and then the door will be opened upon opened for you. Then you will find.
9:13
So we need to pray. We need to ask God. We need to boldly ask him for the
9:18
desires of our heart, the godly desires of our heart. But when we ask God for things for our
9:28
our our prayer requests at the same time we need to have the balance of allowing God's will to be
9:35
done. We need to have humility to know that every desire of our heart may not
9:40
be God's will even if it's a good godly desire. And we also need to know about God's
9:46
timing. We can really want something soon and that can be what we're asking for. But God actually has planned to
9:53
give it to you later. So when you boldly with faith ask for things from God, you need to also have
10:00
balance to allow God's will to be done. So you boldly ask with faith. I believe
10:06
that God will answer my request. Ask and you shall receive.
10:12
But at the same time, I humble myself. Let let your will be done, not mine.
10:18
God, if this is not your will, then I don't want it. You see that balance.
10:26
This is what I mean by the the kingdom of God. The principle of balance also
10:32
um for the promises of God to come to pass. For the promises of God, we are called to be expectant. We are called to
10:39
be like the virgins who kept their oil. They they kept oil in their lamps to keep to keep their their fire burning.
10:46
We are called to be like that to be expectant that the promises will be fulfilled any moment now.
10:53
God wants us to have that expectation and to be ready instead of, oh, it's been a long time. I guess I'll just stop
11:00
expecting now. No, we must have expectancy. That's faith. We must be
11:05
ready for when the promise comes because that's part of us being prepared to walk in the promise.
11:12
But there needs to be balance. There needs to be a balance of being content
11:17
in the waiting. So it's this balance of being so
11:24
expectant, but it not coming yet, but you're not getting weary. You're not
11:30
giving up with being expectant. You're not blaming God because he got you think
11:36
he got your hopes up or something. You feel disappointed. No, you you are content in the waiting because you know
11:43
that you don't know what God's timing is, but it's perfect. And you know that you have surrendered and submitted to
11:49
God's timing. So that means you should not complain. You should not give up. You know it will come but in his timing.
11:57
So there must be balance there as well. Also
12:03
when it comes to uh spending time with God, spending time
12:08
in the word, in prayer, worship,
12:14
it's important to be expectant that God is going to speak. He's going to speak through the word, for example.
12:22
But at the same time, you need to give God control of your relationship with
12:27
him. You need to be okay with however he wants to speak to you, with however he
12:35
wants the intimacy with you to look like. Because sometimes people are always
12:40
wanting a feeling. Or sometimes people may always want a powerful revelation when they read the Bible. But sometimes
12:48
maybe you'll read something in the Bible and you don't have this wild profound revelation,
12:54
but you ate the word of God nonetheless and you were spiritually equipped even though you didn't feel it. And sometimes
13:01
even you'll get revelation later on after what you read. A revelation will
13:06
come. God will speak to you later bringing to remembrance what you read
13:12
and speaking to you. Amen. So you have to have that balance of being expectant in your time that you
13:19
spend with God for him to speak, for him to move, for him to touch you. But have that balance be okay if it's not some uh
13:28
physical feeling you have, but he comes in a in a still small voice type way.
13:35
Amen. Just like when you're with friends, like sometimes you some of you may have gone
13:42
through this before in your life. Sometime I know I used to go through this when I was a teen if it was quiet I
13:48
felt like it wasn't exciting or I wasn't being exciting enough. So I would feel like I had to fill the space and always
13:54
talk and I felt like that was what real intimacy was and excitement and where
14:00
you're really connecting is when you're talking like every single second. But if you're with someone for a long period of
14:06
time, it's okay for there to be silence sometimes. Sometimes that's what's best. Sometimes it's just noise if you're just
14:12
trying to fill the gap, the noise, fill the space, you know. So that's like how it is with God. Sometimes we can be so
14:18
force, you can be so forceful trying to make your relationship with God so exciting
14:24
when it's inauthentic and it's it's controlling the relationship instead of
14:30
allowing God to control the relationship, you know. So there needs to be that balance
14:37
of expectancy but allowing God to be in control of the relationship. Amen.
14:43
And um another example of of having balance is
14:49
when you come to church. When you come to church where God's power is, God's power moves. And God's power makes
14:56
people to fall back with his power. Sometimes sometimes demons are cast out of people and demons shriek as they
15:03
leave. Sometimes the Holy Spirit comes upon people and they are weeping. Sometimes the Holy Spirit comes upon
15:09
people and they feel warm. They feel the fire of the Holy Spirit. Sometimes people are baptized in the Holy Spirit
15:14
and start speaking in tongues. There's a lot of different beautiful manifestations of the Holy Spirit that
15:20
happens in the church where God's power is. And you maybe some of you maybe you
15:26
got delivered and when you first encountered God's power you were delivered and it was a radical
15:34
encounter with God. It was extremely tangible. You really physically felt
15:41
God. I mean maybe you fell back, maybe you felt the anointing come upon you, heat,
15:49
etc. But it was such a physical tangible encounter with God.
15:55
But it's not supposed to be that way every single time. You were set free
16:00
now. You're not going to need to be set free again and again. So therefore, you're not going to have the same physical
16:07
experience every time. But you have to be careful that you don't associate
16:13
encounters with God with the first experience you had where it was full of
16:19
a physical uh tangible touch.
16:24
Amen. And I shared this in a message maybe a few months ago or so, but I want to
16:31
speak this again. I know maybe you didn't some of you didn't hear it, but I shared how when you come to church, you
16:36
shouldn't be coming with the purpose with the motive of having an experience.
16:43
You shouldn't come with the motive of having an experience so you can feel
16:49
like God loves you more. because maybe you feel insecurity. So, you need to feel something. You're
16:55
coming so that you can feel something so you can have more confidence about God's
17:00
love for you and that he's near you. You shouldn't come with that motive. You
17:05
should come with a motive simply to come and encounter Jesus and allow him to
17:10
have his way with you. And what that will look like most of the time is being discipled and transformed
17:20
because this anointing is so powerful. Once you're free, you don't need to keep being free. Once you're healed, you
17:25
don't need to keep being healed. Maybe the enemy will try to attack sometimes and you'll need a healing maybe months later, a year later, but I mean, when
17:32
you're swimming in the anointing, covered in the anointing, you're not going to be needing constant healing.
17:39
There's a protection over you in the spiritual realm. So once you're healed and freed, you're
17:45
good. Like you're you're ready now to be a disciple to to to be made a disciple.
17:52
You're ready to be equipped. You're ready to transform spiritually, and
17:57
you're ready eventually to start receiving impartation, but to be so like your purpose on this
18:03
earth is to lead others to Jesus. Your purpose on this earth is not to constantly have physical experiences
18:10
that make you feel better about yourself and your relationship with God. You know, so you need to come to church
18:16
knowing I'm here to be discipled. I'm here to be transformed, to be equipped for my
18:22
spiritual eyes to open up more about the spiritual realm and the schemes of the devil so that I can have victory over
18:28
the devil so I can be strong in my own personal life. So then I can fulfill my purpose of being a powerful vessel of
18:34
God for others, to help others, to lead others to Jesus, to cast demons out of others, to heal the sick, so I can be
18:41
totally focused on helping other people, not my own spiritual life.
18:46
Amen. So um to be equipped, you don't need to
18:51
have a physical touch, a physical tangible experience to be equipped. It's a spiritual thing to be equipped.
18:58
Amen. And God will come when he wants, maybe with a fresh fire of his spirit. He will
19:04
come, his Holy Spirit will come and touch you and surprise you, and you'll physically feel him sometimes.
19:10
But it's important for you to not be seeking that as if feeling him physically means he's closer.
19:18
It's important you're not feeling down on yourself like you're missing something if you're not feeling him
19:23
physically. God is a spirit.
19:29
He's a spirit. You can't see him, but he's there.
19:36
And it says in uh uh John 20 24.
19:43
One of the 12 disciples, Thomas, nicknamed the twin, was not with the others when Jesus came. They told him,
19:50
"We have seen the Lord." But he replied, "I won't believe it unless I see the nail wounds in his hands, put my fingers
19:57
into them, and placed my hand into the wound in his side." Eight days later, the disciples were together again, and
20:03
this time, Thomas was with them. The doors were locked, but suddenly, as before, Jesus was standing among them.
20:08
"Peace be with you," he said. Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here and look at my hands. Put your hand into
20:13
the wound in my side. Don't be faithless any longer. Believe." "My Lord and my
20:19
God," Thomas exclaimed. Then Jesus told him, "You believe because you have seen
20:24
me. Blessed are those who believe without seeing me.
20:31
You believe because you have seen me because you have felt me. Blessed are are those who believe without seeing me
20:38
or feeling me." Now it is important you know most for for
20:44
for probably most if not every believer God wants them to have an encounter with
20:50
God's power where they feel him especially like the baptism of the Holy
20:56
Spirit like I know for me that was when I was baptized in the Holy Spirit like my tongue was overtaken like that's the
21:03
first time I like felt Jesus that was supernatural I mean speaking in tongues
21:08
that's God on the tongue. Whoa. Hallelujah. And it changed me
21:14
forever. It opened up my eyes. But it was like a burning bush experience.
21:19
God God gave the burning bush as a to get Moses's attention to to to to lift
21:25
his faith so much to open his spiritual eyes so he could then walk by faith and do what God had called him to do. That
21:33
was the purpose of the burning bush. Notice that there's not a burning bush every day.
21:39
with Moses. Once your eyes are open, you see
21:45
you once your eyes are opened, you can see in the spiritual realm.
21:51
You don't need your eyes to be reopened again and again and again. Once God has
21:56
opened up your spiritual eyes when he comes in power in this tangible way many times like deliverance or the baptism of
22:02
the Holy Spirit or a prophetic word um your spirit a big purpose of God doing
22:08
that is opening your spiritual eyes so you can see how good he is how much he loves you how faithful he how faithful
22:15
he is and now that you see his goodness his love his faithfulness that then moves you to surrender to him
22:24
but then your surrender surrendered to him and now your eyes have seen and you're just ready to follow him. Your
22:29
eyes have se you're ready. You don't need to keep having those same experiences.
22:35
In fact, God doesn't want you to have those same exact experiences because that means you're not walking by faith.
22:41
That's why God says, "Blessed are you who believe without seeing
22:47
or feeling." Because the Bible says you can't please God without faith.
22:55
Everything in the kingdom comes by faith and even like for leaders it's important
23:02
that the faith is built so strong so you so you so you were there as an example
23:08
for others so you can say I didn't feel anything I didn't see anything but I
23:13
kept believing and I kept going and God was faithful
23:21
so God wants that he wants that lack of seeing and feeling the physical senses
23:27
involved so that your faith can grow. That's the only way the faith can grow.
23:32
And that's the most important thing to him. That's how he accomplishes everything.
23:37
That's how he does miracles is by people believing in him without seeing. Having
23:43
faith. Hallelujah.
23:48
Hebrews 11:1 says, "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for and the
23:54
evidence of things not seen." This is the amplified version. "The conviction of their reality. Faith comprehends as
24:01
fact what cannot be experienced by the physical senses."
24:06
Faith comprehends as fact what cannot be experienced by the physical senses.
24:20
Hallelujah. So there needs to be that balance when you
24:26
come to church that you are expectant for God to touch you but that you give
24:32
him you surrender to him. You're not like I really just want to feel him
24:37
because then I'll I'll feel better about myself. I'll feel better about my
24:43
relationship with him. I really just need to feel him.
24:49
You shouldn't have that kind of expectancy. You should have the expectancy. Lord, I know you will touch
24:55
me today. Whether I feel anything or not, I know you will touch me in the
25:00
spiritual realm. Whether there's a physical manifestation of what happened in the spiritual realm or not,
25:07
I'm expectant for you to touch me today. for you to speak to me today, for my life to be changed by you, by your power
25:15
today. And I surrender to you with however you want to do it.
25:21
Balance rather than be forceful with your expectation that it must be this
25:26
way, that it must be some physical experience.
25:31
This is very important that we have this balance because in all of these areas that I just mentioned, if you don't have
25:37
this balance, you can open up the door to the angel of light. The devil masquerading himself as an angel of
25:43
light. That's why you have to have this balance
25:48
instead of being strictly I must experience God this way because God will
25:53
be over here not in this way. But you're like no, he must come this way. And so
25:58
then the angel of light can easily deceive because you're not even being open to
26:05
God coming any other way. So you take whatever is coming this way because it's fulfilling the desire you want. So you
26:13
refuse wisdom. You refuse discernment
26:18
because you are not surrendered and you are just wanting it to be this way.
26:25
It says in uh first Kings 19:11,
26:31
"The Lord said to Elijah, "Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord, for the Lord is about to pass
26:37
by." Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the Lord. But the Lord was
26:43
not in the wind. After the wind, there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake
26:50
came a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper. When Elijah heard it, he pulled
26:57
his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Then a voice said to him, "What are you doing
27:03
here, Elijah?" So there was wind, earthquake, and fire,
27:11
and God wasn't in all of those.
27:16
But in the past, God has come through earthquake, wind, and fire. And that's quite exciting. the
27:22
earthquake, wind, and fire. You know, it it says in Matthew 27:50, you know, when
27:28
Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice when he was on the cross, he gave up his spirit. At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two
27:33
from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split, and the tombs broke open. So, this speaks that there was an
27:40
earthquake when Jesus died when he was crucified. And then Matthew 28:1, after the Sabbath
27:47
at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. There was a violent earthquake for an angel of the Lord came
27:53
down from heaven and going to the tomb rolled back the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning and his clothes were white as snow. So at the
28:01
resurrection there's also an earthquake a earthquake. So God was in those
28:06
earthquakes there. Also God God has been in the wind
28:11
before. Acts 2:1 when the day of Pentecost came they were all together in one place. Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from
28:18
heaven and filled the whole house they were sitting. So God has come in the wind too before. Exodus 3:2 there. God
28:25
has also come in the fire. There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from the within a bush.
28:30
Moses saw that through the bush was on fire. It did not burn up. So God does sometimes move through the
28:38
earthquake, wind, and fire. But in this instance, he was coming in a still a small voice. It was so important
28:45
for Elijah to be surrendered, to not be like, "Oh, God's about to pass by. I'm
28:51
so excited to have a burning bush moment like Moses did. To see him come in fire.
28:58
To see him come like the day of Pentecost in the wind. To see him come like earthquake like he has before.
29:05
It's so important for him to surrender and and where surrender to God where you keep your wisdom and discernment and
29:11
balance and know that there's balance too and be able to discern where God is
29:18
speaking this time in the still small voice.
29:24
Amen. Hallelujah.
29:34
Praise God. So in the new wine,
29:41
in the new wine, there was order. God has order. And when I say new wine, I
29:47
mean the Jesus way, the the the the doctrine that Jesus preached, the
29:53
revelation he carried from the Holy Spirit of the word of God, of God's ways
29:59
when he came in the Gospels. You know, the way that he was preaching
30:05
was different from the ways of the Pharisees preaching. Even though they're worshiping the same
30:11
God and they're reading the same word of God, old wine is different from new wine.
30:20
And in the church today, by and large, there is so much old wine.
30:27
So many different doctrines that are actually coming from the old wine and
30:32
not from truly the revelation of the Holy Spirit, the new wine. So
30:39
in the new wine which was what God is restoring in this revival
30:45
there must be order. God is a God of order not chaos or confusion.
30:50
He is a God of order. And so we have to keep that in mind.
30:56
We have to keep that in mind so that we don't just go halfhazardly however we
31:03
want. Behave however we want.
31:08
What you see today by and large is lack of balance. You find churches that are
31:14
opposed to the holy the movement of the Holy Spirit, the manifestations of the Holy Spirit. They're on one extreme.
31:22
But then there tends to be another extreme where the people are so open to the manifestations of the Holy Spirit,
31:29
they love the manifestations of the Holy Spirit that they go wild. Not in a good way but in a bad way.
31:38
No order, no balance, no self-control.
31:46
It says in Galatians 5:22, "But the Holy Spirit
31:52
produces this kind of fruit in our lives. Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
31:57
gentleness, and self-control."
32:04
So, what happens so much of the time in churches that embrace the movement of
32:09
the Holy Spirit, they get they get so excited about the gifts so zealous,
32:18
but they don't want to have self-control. They prophesy out of order. They
32:25
prophesy things that God's not even speaking. That is the angel of light speaking. They prophesy things that, you know, God
32:32
just wasn't calling them to prophesy yet because they need to be matured first to really have wisdom to know this is
32:40
prophes. This is a prophetic word from God. This is not. This is yourself. This is the angel of light. And also the
32:46
wisdom to know when to speak something and when to not to have the wisdom to know this is just something God's
32:51
revealing or maybe this is just your imagination or this is something God's revealing but
32:57
it's not for you to speak to somebody. It's just something you're seeing in the spiritual realm because your spiritual eyes are opened,
33:03
you know. Um so this is what I'm this is what I mean by the importance of
33:08
balance. When I say balance, I'm meaning self-control. self-control of the Holy Spirit to be sensitive to God's order,
33:15
God's timing instead of just doing however you feel.
33:21
We get so excited about Jesus, but we have to know he is a God of order. We get so excited about the spiritual gifts and manifestations, but we have to know
33:27
he's a God of order. And the Holy Spirit has self-control. We have to have self-control
33:33
and walk in wisdom. Amen. Hallelujah.
33:40
So now I after sharing all this, I want to
33:45
share I I want to share all this with you as a foundation to have this foundation to now know how to evangelize
33:54
and represent Jesus rightly as you evangelize.
34:01
The best way to evangelize and share Jesus with others and share revival and
34:06
share about what God is doing is to
34:12
put in your heart, put in your mind that you must have compassion for people
34:22
rather than just do however you feel. You must give them what they need.
34:31
the good news. You must attract them to Jesus.
34:36
You You must be sensitive. What will make them be drawn to Jesus?
34:43
That's having compassion for them. And sometimes that means restrain. Sometimes that means self-control.
34:51
Amen.
34:57
Matthew 9:35 it says, "Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues,
35:02
proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. When he saw the crowds, he had
35:09
compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless
35:15
like sheep without a shepherd." So
35:20
to represent Jesus rightly, God wants you to have this kind of compassion where you're really seeing people,
35:28
you know, and so when you go out, when you're going out to share this good news, the good news with people, really
35:34
have compassion for them and have that heart for them. I really want them to be
35:40
one into the kingdom. I don't want to do anything that would make them confused,
35:47
that would make them not want to come and receive. I want to
35:53
be attractive. I want to demonstrate God with excellence.
35:58
And how you do this is keeping in keeping in your heart this verse that speaks of the fruits of the Holy Spirit.
36:08
Show the fruits to people. Love joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
36:17
faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
36:24
Amen. So sometimes the self-control just and the self-control imbalance we must have
36:30
is to know the time to be to be wild like be wild among your fellow believers
36:39
and be full of joy and full of love but really after others like having a heart
36:46
for other people as you speak to them.
36:52
What I mean by this is like on the day of Pentecost, the fire of the Holy Spirit came and people are so filled
36:58
with the Holy Spirit, they're drunk acting and but there was something God was
37:03
doing through this per through a purpose through this because they were speaking in different tongues and it was making people hear praises of God through their
37:09
tongues. So there was a purpose to that specific um wildness that was going on.
37:17
But shortly after that, Peter, you know, Peter would have been baptized in the Holy Spirit. Imagine Peter is receiving
37:24
the Holy Spirit for the first time. And he's just witnessed so many of the other
37:30
disciples experience the Holy Spirit for the first time. And this is the first time like we all have already heard about this when we before we've heard
37:35
the Holy Spirit. Like this is the first time. And like Jesus was dead, like
37:40
gone. They thought, you know, now they now they're realizing he's actually here with us. like he's here alive in us.
37:48
Like imagine for the first time. Just put yourself in their in Peter's
37:53
shoes, right? What would you want to do that day on the day of Pentecost?
38:03
You know, it was it would honestly take discipline, self-control
38:09
to get off the floor. get up off the floor where you're laughing
38:15
and just want to just have a 20our praise party
38:21
and go and speak with composure to people about Jesus.
38:28
But how scripture goes is they're baptized in the Holy Spirit. They're speaking in tongues. They're full of the
38:34
joy of the Lord. They're looking like they're drunk. And like right after that, Peter goes and he just speaks with
38:41
composure, you know, the gospel. And the Bible says 3,000 were led to Jesus that day.
38:51
So many people in their in their carnal thinking when they think that it's all about a physical experience, they could
38:57
think that if I just, you know, I just hit get hit by the Holy
39:03
Spirit in the middle of the preaching. Some people could think, "Wow, that was the most powerful service
39:10
we had." The way God came and touched Apostle Katherine, you know, that's not
39:15
spiritual. Glory to God. God is in me.
39:21
He's in me. You know, we don't need to have a physical experience to have that like
39:27
evidence that he's really moving right now through the word, that he's really moving right now through the service.
39:34
What God needs for the people right now, for you right now, is for you to be
39:41
equipped, for you to hear the word. That's what's really important right now. Not for God to strike me down so I
39:48
can start laughing, being full of the joy of the Lord right now. He needs the message to go forth. That can happen
39:53
later. Not right now in my own time with God. But right now, I need to be of
39:59
composure and speak clearly the message to you because this is what God needs to
40:05
be done. This is having compassion for the people,
40:12
you know? I mean, man, after hearing these testimonies, I have to be like, "Okay,
40:18
preach." Like, it takes self-control. Sometimes you can probably tell I'm like, "Well, I don't know."
40:27
You know, it takes self-control to to
40:33
just have be be obedient to the Holy Spirit. Okay, I want you to preach the word now
40:40
with clarity, with focus, with a heart for the people.
40:49
Amen. Amen. So you see that balance among each other in the upper room.
40:54
They're filled with the Holy Spirit. They're drunk with the Holy Spirit, but the Holy Spirit's like, "Quick, go. I
41:00
know you want to stay there, but I want you to compose yourselves and preach. Be the light of the world.
41:06
And I need you to speak clearly because otherwise they won't hear you. They won't know what's going on. They'll think you're weird. They'll something's
41:13
wrong with you mentally or something and they'll leave. They need to hear the word of God right now. these people,
41:19
they won't understand. They won't understand. Oh, wow. They're touched by the Holy Spirit right now.
41:27
You know, we have to have that wisdom and self-control to be thinking, what is the best way I
41:34
can have compassion for people? What is the best way I can shine my light and be
41:40
attractive to them so that they will want to hear what I'm saying about Jesus? so that they will want to come to
41:46
to the church to come into this revival. And when you have that as your motive,
41:52
as your intention in your heart, the Holy Spirit will lead you.
41:59
When you carry that in your heart, the fruits of the Holy Spirit that I must have, which includes self-control, the Holy Spirit will lead you.
42:08
Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
42:17
Thank you, Jesus. So, um,
42:26
in this new phase of revival where God is calling you to get out there more than ever, God wants you to have this
42:32
equipping to shine your light in the most effective way because the harvest
42:38
is so ripe and he wants to win all of those souls from all these different backgrounds. Some people don't have
42:44
never heard of Jesus. Some people have heard of Jesus their whole lives and are turned off by religion. Some people are
42:51
in church currently but don't know of God's power. Have never encountered God's power. They're oppressed with
42:57
demons. So when you go out into the world and you shine your light, you have
43:02
to be aware of all these different people with all these different backgrounds and carry that intention in
43:08
your heart with every person. How can I lead them to you, Jesus? And
43:14
as you do that, the Holy Spirit will give you the words. He will give you the wisdom of what to do, of what to say, of
43:22
how to shine your light. Amen. Hallelujah.
43:27
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
43:32
Praise God. Praise God. Thank you, Lord.
43:39
You know, as a Samaritan woman at the well went around and shared her testimony with everybody, that's what
43:46
brought in the harvest. The Bible says that many came to Jesus because of the woman's testimony.
43:52
Many people came and God is ready to increase his revival. He's ready to
43:57
increase this church. But the way it's going to happen is not from God speaking from heaven. Is not
44:04
from God giving people dreams. for the most part, come to 5F Church. Come to
44:10
revival. But how God is going to enlarge his revival and this church is by doing
44:17
what he did through the Samaritan woman at the well. Many people, many more people,
44:23
thousands, millions more came into this revival. Thousands
44:28
more came to 5F Church where we had to get a bigger venue for church services
44:36
because of the woman and the man's testimony.
44:41
Because of this woman, you because of this man. You because of this man. You
44:47
because of this woman. You because of this man. Because of this woman man. You. You. You. You. You.
44:57
[Music] Because of all of you,
45:04
because of you, many came to Jesus.
45:11
Because of you, not because of me up here,
45:19
because of you. Sheep produce sheep. That's how the revival grows. If you
45:26
will go out and spread the good news that is being preached, that is being released. That's how more people will
45:31
come into the kingdom. Amen. Jesus moving through you. Yes, I have a
45:39
part to play. But how it will grow, how the revival grows from here is up to
45:45
you. To get people to the good news that's being released,
45:51
to get people to the anointing that's being released. Are you ready to go out there and be
45:59
like the Samaritan woman at the well and share this good news? Are you ready?
46:05
Hallelujah. God's ready to use you so powerfully to bring in this harvest. He's equipped you today to shine your
46:12
light effectively so you win them all. You win all those souls out there who need him. Amen.
46:18
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
46:25
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. God, we
46:32
thank you for the harvest that you have prepared and the harvest that will come in.
46:39
We thank you for expanding this revival through every single one of these people here and watching online. We thank you
46:45
Jesus for bringing the lost and the impressed and the sick to this church to
46:51
your revival. Thank you Jesus for moving upon every seed sown. We thank you
46:57
Jesus. Amen. Amen. And hallelujah.
