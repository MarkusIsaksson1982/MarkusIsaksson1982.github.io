0:00
Colossians 1:9 it says, "For this reason, since the day
0:07
we heard about it, we have not stopped praying for you, asking specifically
0:12
that you may be filled with the knowledge of God's will, his will, in
0:19
all spiritual wisdom, with insight into his purposes,
0:25
and an understanding of spiritual things so that you will walk in a manner worthy
0:33
of the Lord, displaying admiral character, moral courage, and personal
0:39
integrity, to fully please him in all things, bearing fruit in every good
0:46
work, and steadily growing in the knowledge of God with deeper faith,
0:53
clearer insight, and fervent love for his precepts.
0:59
So, um, this is the amplified version. By the way, I want to read another
1:05
scripture. Ephesians 1:15. Ever since I first heard of your strong
1:10
faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for God's people everywhere, I have not
1:16
stopped thanking God for you. He's speaking this to the disciples, to the
1:22
people in the church, the believers. I pray for you constantly
1:27
asking God, the glorious father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to give you spiritual
1:32
wisdom and insight so that you might grow in your knowledge of God.
1:41
I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light so that you can understand
1:48
the confident hope he has given to those he called, his holy people who are his rich and glorious inheritance. I also
1:55
pray that you will understand the incredible greatness of God's power for
2:00
us who believe him. This is the same mighty power that raised Christ from the dead and seated him in the place of
2:06
honor at God's right hand in the heavenly realms. So today I'm going to be teaching on
2:12
growing in the knowledge of God. So, we're seeing these the we're seeing
2:19
Paul, we're seeing five-fold ministers now in the in the New Testament church
2:25
praying for the believers and teaching this importance of them growing in the
2:33
knowledge of God, growing in their insight to be more in the spiritual
2:41
things, their understanding to grow. So this
2:47
shows us the great importance of knowing God,
2:54
understanding the spiritual things. As the scripture says, when you understand the spiritual things, when you have the
3:02
knowledge of God, you'll be able to then please God. You'll be able to live morally upright and and and do what God
3:11
is asking and be in his will. Amen. So
3:18
what is the knowledge of God? First of all, number one,
3:24
it is God's heart.
3:29
First of all, knowing God himself. We have to know God and then we will
3:35
understand his kingdom. We will understand his ways. we will understand the spiritual
3:43
things that come from him. So it is so important that you have a knowledge of
3:51
God's heart and that you keep this knowledge. You don't forget it. So the
3:58
heart of God is full of love. No judgment, no condemnation. And it says
4:05
there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
4:13
So that that means he's not judging you for making a mistake. He has grace for
4:20
you. He understands that we are in a spiritual war.
4:26
So he's not looking for immediate perfection when you become a believer.
4:32
He knows. He understands even he came in the flesh as Jesus. Jesus came in the
4:39
flesh as fully God, fully human and he went through temptations. He went
4:45
through feeling so hungry. He went through that discomfort and pain and suffering in the garden of Gethsemane.
4:52
He he prays to the father, "Take this cup from me, Lord." Even though Jesus knew that wasn't God's will. And so he
4:59
says, "This is what I desire. I'm praying this. I'm asking this, but not
5:04
my will be done. Let your will be done. So, he understands our weaknesses. He
5:12
understands temptations. He understands we're in a spiritual war.
5:17
So, he's not judging you when you make a mistake. He's looking for repentance.
5:24
Now, there is the judgment of God that comes after we live our lives and die.
5:29
And then it says words will be judged. the negative words we speak will be judged. But when we repent, he wipes
5:37
them away. That judgment comes when there's not repentance. But when if we would live a life of
5:43
repentance, if we would live a life of surrender and obedience, then God washes
5:49
away all of our sins. All of your sins are washed away. All of them. But you have to live a life
5:57
of repentance, a life of surrender. And then there is no judgment
6:03
for those who are in Christ Jesus. There is no condemnation. The Bible says not
6:09
there's no not simply there's no condemnation. There's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For
6:15
those who are living surrender to God, for those who are living a life of continual repentance when that's needed.
6:22
Amen. So this is the heart of God. He is full of love. He is full of grace. He is
6:27
full of compassion. is full of mercy and he's a real person. He's not just
6:33
this lord that's lording over you things just cuz he wants to just cuz he can.
6:41
Everything that he asks you asks you to do is for a purpose and is for your good.
6:48
So he does not have all of these rules that are with no purpose and that you
6:53
just have to follow them for no reason and it takes the fun out of life. That's not God. Every command he has for you is
7:01
for your protection. Is to leave. It it is a road mapap into
7:06
receiving freedom and then maintaining the freedom and walking in abundant
7:12
life. Amen. So God is amazing and magnificent. His
7:21
love we cannot even comprehend. His love is so amazing for you and for every
7:27
single person on this earth. He is nothing but good. Any evil that happens on this earth is
7:34
not God. It's not God. It's the devil. God is nothing but good. His thoughts
7:41
for you are nothing but good. His plans for you are nothing but good. When you
7:48
mistake make a mistake, his thoughts for you are nothing but good.
7:54
For I know the plans I have for you. Not just for those who are perfect. That's
7:59
not even a thing. I know the plans I have for you. All of you. Those of you that would follow me. God says
8:07
these plans are not to harm you, but to give you hope and a future to prosper you.
8:13
Amen. Hallelujah. This is the heart of God.
8:19
And this is this is the most important part of having the knowledge of God of
8:26
having the knowledge of God's kingdom and spiritual things is having this
8:33
understanding of who God is. His heart. His heart for you. His heart for all
8:39
people. His heart for your future. His heart for this world.
8:44
His heart for the church. Amen.
8:51
Part of God's heart, the knowledge of God that is so important to have is his
8:56
is this love for his people. This great love for his people.
9:06
This love that he has for his people equals
9:12
freedom and healing. He loves his people so much that he
9:18
never wants them to be in bondage from the devil even a day.
9:24
He wants that bondage from the devil to be broken off of people's lives. There's
9:29
a difference between weapons formed against you
9:35
and weapons that prosper. He allows weapons to be formed against you to test
9:40
your faith. and he brings you victory as you stand
9:45
firm and fight the good fight of faith. But he does not want weapons to ever
9:53
prosper. So yes, he allows attacks of the enemy to happen, but it's
9:59
all for your good. But he does not want any person to be in bondage from the
10:07
devil. He allows anxious thoughts to come in your mind,
10:14
but he does not want you to be bound with the spirit of anxiety.
10:21
He allows attacks from the enemy of temptation to come, but he's does not want you to be bound by addiction.
10:29
He can allow the enemy to send dark thoughts to you, but he does not want you to be bound by depression or the
10:36
spirit of death and suicide. He allows the enemy to bring attacks
10:41
towards your health. But he does not want you to ever have a bondage from the enemy of sickness
10:48
and pain. You understand the difference?
10:56
And so when a person is in bondage from the devil, this is a 911 emergency. God
11:01
sees it as this person must be free.
11:09
I used to be a lifeguard. It's my first job as a teen. And the Lord gave me this
11:16
vision today. Vision last night. Uh
11:22
how when people are in bondage, it's like they are struggling on the surface or
11:28
about to drown, gasping for air in the water.
11:36
And God chooses to use vessels
11:41
to deliver and heal people. He chooses to put power his power in them and use
11:47
them to cast out demons and heal the sick. And so God has called us to heal the
11:52
sick, to cast out the demons in addition to preaching that the kingdom of heaven is at hand as part of our great
11:57
commission. And so he's commanded us to be lifeguards in the spiritual realm.
12:04
He's commanded us to be ready to save somebody.
12:09
It's Jesus saving, but we're a vessel he say he he he used to save.
12:15
But that's our job to be available and be be ready, be alert to see if
12:23
someone's drowning with demonic oppression and sickness. And when we see them struggling, we are
12:30
called to jump in that water and save them.
12:38
We are called to cast the demons out or we are called to point them to where God's power is moving.
12:47
Point them to where they can be free.
12:52
And what you have in the body of Christ today is you have so many leaders,
13:00
Christian leaders, and so many just believers who
13:06
think it's okay to do the chill lifeguard job only.
13:13
I was a lifeguard and praise God, I never had to get in the water.
13:18
I never had to rescue somebody, but I was trained for it and I was ready for it and I knew that I signed up for this
13:26
and I was ready. I wasn't going to hesitate if I had to go jump in the water, even though it would be very
13:31
uncomfortable and scary feeling and it's a lot of pressure and responsibility.
13:38
Um, so I was thinking about the Lord was
13:44
reminding me of like lifeguarding, how chill the job was. I was at a um
13:49
in my home hometown there's only a population of 1,200 people. There's not even cell phone service to this day. And
13:55
so it was a town pool that wasn't very busy. So my job was very chill and quite
14:01
easy. Just sit out in the sun and I didn't really have to do much. Walk, please use
14:08
the ladder. That's that was most of my job. But you know,
14:14
it was chill. It was it was fun even. It there was no uncomfortable parts really.
14:22
And the Lord was showing me yesterday how many Christians that's the life they want. They want the
14:29
chill lifeguard life. They don't want to jump in the water and get uncomfortable.
14:36
Um leading people to where God's power is. speaking up that revival is truly
14:43
now and that people can be set free if they would position themselves where God's power is moving.
14:50
Speaking this today leads to persecution in in one way or another
14:57
because the enemy hates that more than anything for God's people to be free. And so when you speak up and you lead
15:02
you point people how to be free, the enem is not going to like it. The enemy is going to want to silence you. the
15:09
enemy is going to want to stop you from doing that again. And so in today's time, the enemy's
15:14
strategy, the way he tries to stop you is usually through persecution. Is usually through the religious spirit.
15:22
The same spirit coming through the Pharisees, accusing Jesus, of being from the devil, of using demonic powers, of
15:29
going against the word of God. That same spirit is at work today.
15:35
That's this that's the that's the main spirit the devil uses to try to keep people from being free, to try to keep
15:43
revival from spreading is the fear and intimidation
15:48
spirit that comes by being persecuted.
15:56
And so there's many believers and there's there's many believers, there's many Christian leaders who think it's
16:02
fine because they are doing their job as a lifeguard.
16:08
They're preaching. They're doing a lot of good things. They're doing their job,
16:15
but there's people drowning.
16:21
There's people drowning and you are looking the other way. That's horrible.
16:31
But there's many there's many believers there's many Christian leaders who who think it's okay to look the other way.
16:41
They are missing the knowledge of God. They're missing the knowledge of God's
16:47
heart.
16:53
There is testimony after testimony of impartation here. We've heard some today.
16:59
Praise God. Like I'm telling you, the whole body of
17:05
Christ right now, every church, if if people who have not even been in
17:11
seminary, we hear these testimonies. Sarah, you shared one yesterday. Maybe
17:16
I'll have you share it next week. She just shared one yesterday of just a friend called her. She was led by the
17:23
Lord to pray for her and she heard the friend had to pull over. She was driving and started coughing out. Coughing up.
17:28
She was being delivered. Praise God.
17:33
But but but there's there's these testimonies of
17:39
impartation. There's so many testimonies of impartation here. And these people who've received impartation, they are a
17:46
lot of them, most of them have not even gone to seminary. Most of them are not ministers.
17:54
What I'm saying is like, do you know how easy and simple it would be for church leaders around the world
18:01
to receive impartation?
18:08
If God can just pour it out so easily to you, what you don't need all these
18:14
things to receive impartation. You just need to have that heart that will go and rescue someone when they need rescuing
18:21
with not caring what people will think.
18:27
Dying to your ego. That's all God's looking for. a pure
18:33
heart that's surrendered to him that will care about what God thinks about them than anything else. More than
18:39
anything else. Not caring what people think. Not caring what people will say. Not caring about connections. You'll
18:46
lose doors that will shut in you in your face now
18:52
because these people don't agree with you because these people are religious.
19:00
And and as I see this as I I see people I see people here receiving impartation
19:06
so easily and it's it's grieving that pastors that
19:12
other believers that that they wouldn't just humble themselves and simply receive so that they can rescue the
19:19
people in their churches.
19:24
or even if even even to not even receive impartation but just to speak up and say
19:31
you need rescuing Jesus can deliver you. I've heard testimonies of many people being
19:38
delivered here at this church if we could actually act like a united body
19:44
that we were intended to. And I I I can go on and on about this,
19:51
but I already did a few weeks ago in a message, prophetic word for pastors and
19:56
leaders, but it's for everybody, not just leaders. So, go watch that message from a few days ago. But
20:03
the heart of God is to rescue his people because he's loves his people so much.
20:09
The anointing is here. We do not have to keep praying for revival. We do not have to keep praying for the anointing to
20:15
come. It has come. It is here on this earth now. God has released it in the body of Christ. Not just here at 5F
20:22
Church. This anointing is to be shared and passed. But people have to have the
20:28
heart to rescue people, to free people, not caring what people will think. They
20:33
have to humble themselves and be pure in order to receive it.
20:38
I can't just I can't just go to every church building and say, "I release the anointing here. May the pastor now walk
20:44
in this anointing." It's up to the pastor, the minister. God only releases
20:50
it when your heart can simply be humble and pure and surrendered to him.
20:55
It's not hard to do that. But you have to do that. That's the requirement.
21:01
Amen. So this is the heart of God
21:08
that people would be free and healed.
21:14
This is just as important as salvation. This is part of salvation.
21:21
Salvation, freedom, healing, being freed from the enemy's grip. They are all in
21:28
one. Preaching of the gospel, preaching the word.
21:34
That's why Jesus with great commission, he says, "Preach that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. heal the sick, cast
21:41
out demons all together. He doesn't say mostly preach sometimes
21:50
cast out demons or some of you just deliverance ministries will cast out demons. He doesn't say that. He puts it
21:57
all there together. And there's a verse in the gospels where it says Jesus went from town to town preaching
22:04
and a n and casting out demons
22:13
like that was the ministry of Jesus. Hallelujah.
22:19
This is the heart of God. Many people are missing this knowledge of God.
22:28
Many people are doing the things that they have learned. They have learned wrong doctrine.
22:35
They have learned wrong religious doctrine. Um Galatians 4 8-9 and then
22:40
verse 12. But at that time when you did not know the true God and were
22:47
unacquainted with him, you Gentiles were slaves to those pagan things which by
22:55
their very nature were not and could not be gods at all. Now, however, since you
23:00
have come to know the true God through personal experience,
23:09
or rather to be known by God, how is it that you are turning back again to the
23:14
weak and worthless elemental principles of religions and philosophies to which
23:20
you want to be enslaved all over again? Believers, I beg of you, become as I am,
23:28
free from the bondage of Jewish ritualism and ordinances in today's
23:34
time. Free from the bondage of religious doctrine that's been fed to you. This
23:40
old wine religious garbage that's not pleasing to God that keeps
23:46
you going around in circles of sin because religion is bondage. these
23:51
religious rituals and performing your way to please God, to try to please God.
23:59
For I have become as you are a gentile. You did me no wrong when I first came to you. Do not do it now.
24:09
So you find so many believers, so many Christian leaders,
24:14
they are looking at what the majority is doing and the majority is not casting out demons. and walking in the
24:21
anointing. But but there's many people that are famous. There are many people who who have tons of followers. There
24:27
are many people that are that have so much success in the Christian world and they're not doing these things.
24:35
So many people they are not humbling themselves to receive this greater
24:40
knowledge of God's heart and they are continuing in this wrong religious
24:47
doctrine. They are praying hours on end. They
24:54
think that they are really being a great Christian.
25:01
But in fact, in reality, they are missing God's heart.
25:08
In reality, they are not rescuing God's people.
25:14
They are preaching nice words while people are drowning in bondage and they
25:19
are smiling pretty and they are preaching with passion.
25:25
But God's people are drowning and they can't even hear.
25:34
The Bible says John 15:12, "This is my commandment.
25:40
Love each other in the same way I have loved you." There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's
25:48
friends. You are my friends if you do what I command. So he's saying to you, Jesus
25:55
laid down his life for his friends. He laid down his literal physical life.
26:01
But he is asking you, he is asking us to also lay down our lives.
26:08
Not to make ourselves to be killed. No. as a sacrifice. Jesus already did that.
26:15
But he's the Bible says you cannot be my disciple unless you pick up your cross and leave everything to follow me. So he
26:24
is calling all of you to lay down your life for your friends, to lay down your
26:30
life for your the strangers, for for people that are really God's children
26:35
that he loves so much that are drowning. to lay down your life like a lifeguard would lay down their life for a stranger
26:41
drowning in the pool.
26:46
Amen. It's worth the persecution. That's
26:52
laying down your life. I'm going to be used as a vessel of God right now to deliver this person.
26:58
Whether it's casting the demon out by rece after you receive anointing or leading them to where God's power is moving, pointing to them to where they
27:05
can receive freedom. You're laying down your life. You know, there's a cost to that. When I was when I was training to
27:11
be a lifeguard and I took the test, I had to go to the bottom of a 12-oot pool and grab a brick and bring it up and
27:18
swim with it on my back. That was really difficult. That was very
27:23
uncomfortable. And if I had to save somebody, I would be risking my own life
27:28
putting that person first. All right. This is what God has called
27:34
us to do. not be comfortable Christians who don't have any persecution.
27:42
I am convinced Romans 8:18 passion translation. I am convinced that any suffering we endure is less than nothing
27:50
compared to the magnitude of glory that is about to be unveiled within us.
27:57
And this is my message. I I I pray that people watching online, people here who
28:03
who are like the comfortable Christian out there that that are not laying down your life
28:11
for God's people. I pray that God would open up your eyes and would give you more knowledge of
28:16
this of God's heart and also this spiritual knowledge of this scripture
28:22
that the suffering that you endure that comes from persecution. Persecution
28:29
is not fun. Persecution stinks. Okay, I'll tell you that. It's
28:35
suffering. It's part of the suffering we are called to on this earth. But I'm telling you,
28:42
this suffering we endure is less than nothing compared
28:48
to the magnitude of glory that is about to be unveiled within us.
28:58
The magnitude of glory of revival spreading of lives saved and moved into
29:03
real surrender to Jesus of lives healed and delivered and transformed.
29:08
It's I'm telling you, I've been through a lot of persecution, but this glory that I'm experiencing and even more that
29:15
will come. The glory of God I get to see in my life, the fruits for his glory is
29:21
far greater. It surpasses the suffering I've had to endure, the
29:28
suffering of persecution.
29:34
It's a life of so much greater joy. greater glory and most importantly it's
29:42
the only life where you will actually please God. Stop fooling yourself
29:50
by being a comfortable Christian
29:56
doing your religious rituals. Stop fooling yourself. You're not pleasing God.
30:03
Get to know God's heart. Grow in the knowledge of God's heart for his people.
30:10
Know what really matters to God. He's appointed you to be a lifeguard in
30:16
the spiritual realm. Jump in the pool. Jump in the water and rescue his people.
30:24
You're not here to get a tan and look good.
30:32
Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God.
30:44
So the message today, God wants you to know the importance of growing in the knowledge of God. Because what I've been
30:50
trying to what I've been sharing with you is that there are Christians that have been Christians for a long time that are even successful Christians,
30:56
influencers, Christian leaders who they're limited of the they're so
31:02
limited in their knowledge of God. They're limited. They have limited knowledge of God's heart. And you see
31:10
how dangerous this is, how detrimental this is when you simply don't have the knowledge of God's heart.
31:18
what really matters to him. He doesn't care about your religious rituals.
31:25
He doesn't care how many hours you're praying and reading the Bible and all the the the the the things you are
31:30
preaching if you are not rescuing his people who were in bondage,
31:36
leading them to be free. How to have the knowledge of God. How to
31:43
grow in the knowledge of God. Well, the Bible is so clear about this.
31:49
It says Matthew 3:10, the prince, the disciples came to him
31:55
and asked,"Wh do you speak to the people in parables?" He replied, "Because,"
32:01
so Jesus is saying this, "because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom
32:08
of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.
32:18
Verse 13. Though seeing they do not see, though hearing, they do not hear or understand.
32:25
In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah. You will never You will be ever hearing but never understanding. You
32:31
will be ever seeing but never perceiving. For this people's heart has become callous. They hardly hear with
32:37
their ears. They and they close their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears,
32:43
understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them. But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your
32:49
ears because they hear. For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people long to see what you see, but did not
32:55
see it, and to hear what you hear, but did not hear it. So he's saying, "Blessed are you, your eyes see."
33:03
He's saying, "Other people, they do not see because their hearts have become calloused." How do hearts become callous? By one's
33:10
choice. By one's choice to not humble themselves. Simple. That's it.
33:19
Pharaoh. Pharaoh was given many opportunities.
33:24
Many opportunities to humble himself, to humble his heart
33:30
and be obedient to God. God gave him chance after chance after
33:35
chance. That wasn't just for anything. That wasn't just for God to show his
33:41
wonders, doing all of those signs and wonders in Egypt. the amount of them.
33:46
God was continually giving Pharaoh free will, a
33:52
choice, speaking, revealing to him, like showing
33:58
him, revealing himself, giving him an opportunity to have
34:04
understanding of God, that he was real, that he was all
34:09
powerful, that he was the only God and his the other gods were rubbish.
34:16
and that he should obey him. God kept
34:23
showing himself. I mean, kept bringing different
34:29
destructions upon the land. It wasn't all at once. Pharaoh just kept choosing to keep the pride.
34:39
His son did not have to die. All of the firstborns did not have to die. But
34:46
Pharaoh chose that. He chose for his heart to become callous.
34:58
When the disciples came back from casting out demons for the very first time, one of the first things that Jesus
35:04
says is, "Father, I praise you for hiding these things, the spiritual
35:09
things we keep hearing about in these scriptures, the spiritual things from
35:15
those who are wise and proud and only revealing it to the humble and
35:21
childlike." So the word is very clear.
35:29
The pure in heart shall see God. The pure in heart shall gain understanding.
35:35
Shall have more of the knowledge of God. Shall know God more. Shall understand
35:41
him and his ways. It's very simple. And to be pure is a
35:48
choice. It's not about luck. It's not about some people are born with it, some people are not. To be pure in heart is a
35:56
choice everyone can make. Everyone can make. And God is so good to
36:03
pursue people and reveal himself to lead them into repentance if they
36:09
would only choose. Everyone can choose this.
36:16
Everyone can choose to receive the knowledge of the spiritual things that
36:22
it talks about in this scripture. The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom
36:27
of heaven. So that's how you will gain knowledge and that's how you will keep on gaining
36:34
more and more knowledge. The message today, the message God has for you is that he wants you to keep on growing in
36:41
knowledge every day. to never become stagnant but to keep
36:47
growing because that is how you will be able to stay in his will and he will be
36:54
able to use you even more powerfully with every day is when you become more
37:01
spiritual. It's how you become more like Christ is by your eyes opening up more to who he
37:08
is. Because when you when you can see who he is, then you can imitate that.
37:18
When you see who he is, when you see his heart, then you know what you're supposed to be like on this earth,
37:27
what Jesus is really like, that he really is this good, full of
37:32
love. The more your spiritual eyes open up, the more you'll be able to love people better. You'll see them how God sees
37:39
them. The more your spiritual eyes will open up, the more your faith will grow.
37:50
the more you will not give into temptation to complain and to step out
37:56
of God's will when things don't come in your timing
38:01
because your eyes have opened up to really understand just how good God is,
38:07
just how faithful he is, just how perfect his ways are, just how perfect
38:12
his timing is, just how much he is in control. How big
38:19
he is, the more your spiritual eyes open up. So
38:25
for your spiritual eyes to open up more and more is the most important thing.
38:31
It's how you're able to see God's love more and how then you'll be able to love him back the best and how you'll be able
38:38
to be a vessel of him the best and be in his will and be victorious over the
38:44
devil. The more your eyes open up to who God is and how big he is, you'll see how
38:49
tiny the devil is. And he'll never get to you again. He'll
38:54
never bother you again. The the taller you you'll stand with
38:59
godly confidence, the better you'll walk in your authority,
39:06
the more snakes and scorpions you'll trample on. Hallelujah.
39:12
Hallelujah. So you need to to to to grow in this
39:18
knowledge always you have to stay pure in heart. You have to keep humbling yourself. When you start to feel
39:26
thoughts of entitlement to come in, thoughts of jealousy to come in, thoughts of impatience to come in,
39:34
that's like a 911 alert. It should be like fire alarms going off
39:39
like, "Oh, nope. I'm not going backwards. I got to keep moving forwards forward.
39:47
God has opened up my eyes to who he is. That he is worthy of my surrender.
39:54
That I don't deserve anything. So why am I feeling entitled? Why am I feeling jealous? Get out of here. These lies.
40:03
Hallelujah. Why am I feeling impatient? God's timing is perfect. The reason the promise
40:08
hasn't come to pass yet is because it would crush me if it came now. It wouldn't last if it came now. When it
40:15
comes, it's God's perfect timing and it will be protected and we will enjoy it the most.
40:22
It will be the most beautiful when it comes in God's timing. Why am I impatient?
40:28
So, that brings me to the the next important thing of not only do we need to keep move moving forward, but we need
40:33
to make sure you're not going backward. You need to make sure you're not losing the knowledge you gained. Because you ever try to think back 10
40:40
years ago and it's like kind of freaky because you can't remember certain things.
40:45
You like you remember being somewhere but you don't know remember who you were with. I did that the other day. I'm like
40:51
wow. Because it's not important to remember. Our mind can't store all that
40:57
all that information. We weren't built to store like every single little detail for our whole lives. You know what I
41:03
mean? And so what we do remember is what we value, what memories are important to
41:09
us. And so when God opens up your eyes,
41:16
you have to choose to keep that memory. You have to choose to keep that
41:22
knowledge that you didn't once have, but then you did receive one day. You have
41:27
to choose to keep meditating, meditating on it. You have to choose to to keep
41:32
remembering, oh yes, I used to be in darkness in this area. I used to not know spiritually things in this area.
41:40
But then God opened up my eyes. I used to be lukewarm. I used to to not really
41:46
understand how worthy God was. But then God opened up my eyes to see how worthy he is of my surrender
41:53
and that nothing matters but obeying him. There was a day that my eyes opened
41:59
up. You have to remember that day. You have to renew your mind to that specific
42:04
knowledge that God gave you on those life-changing days that changed
42:10
everything. Or else you can go backwards. It can be a memory that is lost, that knowledge
42:16
you have received. Proverbs 2:1, "My son, if you will receive my words and treasure my
42:22
commandments within you, so that your ear is attentive to skillful and godly wisdom and apply your heart to understanding, seeking it
42:28
conscientiously and striving for it eagerly. Yes. If you cry out for insight and lift up your voice for
42:34
understanding, if you seek skillful and godly wisdom as you would silver and search for her as as you would hidden
42:40
treasures, then you will understand the reverent fear of the Lord that is worshiping him and regarding him as
42:46
truly awesome and discover the knowledge of God.
42:52
Hallelujah. So you have to be searching after this
42:58
wisdom. You have to be according to this word, you have your ear has to be attentive to skillful and godly wisdom.
43:05
You have to seek this understanding conscientiously and striving for it eagerly.
43:11
Hallelujah. You need to seek this wisdom and treasure it as silver.
43:17
Amen. Colossians 3:8 says, "But now rid yourselves completely of all these
43:23
things, anger, ra anger, rage, malice, slander, and obscene, abusive, filthy, vulgar language from your mouth. Do not
43:29
lie to one another. For you, for you have stripped off the old self with its evil practices, and you have put on the
43:36
new spiritual self, who is being continually renewed in true knowledge in
43:42
the image of him who created the new self." Hallelujah. So you have to be
43:49
continually you have to continually renew your mind to put on the new spiritual self.
43:55
So when you first become a believer, you have a new self, the new self, the new you're a new
44:02
creation. But that's day one of your spiritual
44:07
eyes opening up and the knowledge of God coming in you. Just day one, it's a
44:13
journey each day of seeking God. When you seek God with all your heart, then you will find him. So as you keep
44:19
seeking God, you find more of him. As you keep seeking God, your knowledge of
44:24
God and the kingdom of God and the spiritual things, his ways, it
44:29
increases. It keeps on increasing.
44:35
And so that becomes so you're like stepping into your new self each day
44:41
more and more. So you have to keep renewing your mind to according to the scripture according to the scripture it
44:48
says put on the new self.
44:54
So I'm telling you when years pass it be you really have to make the discipline to put on your new spiritual self
45:03
the aspect of your new spiritual self that you got on day one or year one
45:09
because like when your eyes first open up to how God is so worthy of your surrender and all you want to do is
45:14
please him. that is in your mind so sharp, the fire in your heart every day
45:21
at first, but then as time passes, you are going
45:27
to have to make the choice to put on again your new spiritual self
45:36
because it's a life of mountains and valleys. And I've seen this pattern in my life. And I've seen on mountains
45:44
I have just this overwhelming fire for Jesus.
45:52
Oh, it's just this fire to please him. It's so sharp in my mind. And I found in
45:58
valleys that I have to make the intention to put on my new self.
46:06
Because on mountain tops everything is easy, everything is exciting.
46:12
But in valleys things feel dry. They naturally feel dry.
46:19
Wilderness is dry. As you put on your new self, you will
46:25
drink from the well that never runs dry. Hallelujah.
46:31
Hallelujah. But it's the natural feeling. It's kind of like when you step outside and it's
46:39
so hot and you're like as opposed to a beautiful normal LA day of like low 70s.
46:49
It's like in the valleys you have to make an an extra intention to put on
46:56
your new self or else you'll go backwards.
47:07
I remember when four the four and a half years of serving God when I started walking in my calling and I started the
47:13
church four and a half years before revival broke out and I'm holding on this promise that revival is going to break
47:19
out and I was having this expectancy it was going to break out like every week
47:25
for years and the church got smaller and smaller with each year through those years
47:32
and I remember like there was so many times thoughts would come to my mind
47:37
like condemning thoughts like maybe I'm doing something wrong.
47:43
Maybe that's why it's not happening. I don't know if I'm I hope I'm pleasing
47:50
God, but I'm not sure completely because of the because we're getting smaller.
47:55
Maybe I'm doing something wrong. You know, really condemnation would be
48:01
there. And I had been free of those voices of
48:07
condemnation in the past. I had been free years before. But as time passed and I was deep in
48:14
that wilderness, the enemy came for a time. He will come. The Bible says
48:21
when Jesus Jesus was tempted by the by the devil in the wilderness and it says the Holy Spirit led him there. And so in
48:28
a time of vulnerability, in a time of weakness, the devil came
48:34
because he knew his chances were better in the weak times and the weakness.
48:40
And Jesus overcame and he defeated the enemy. He passed the test and then the Bible says that the devil left him for a
48:47
time. So the devil will come from time to time. So I had been free of the voice of
48:54
condemnation. That was what I dealt with the most before I was surrendered to God. Before I was baptized in the Holy
49:01
Spirit and then surrendered to God. I've been free of that completely. But then a few years passed and the church is
49:07
getting smaller and smaller and smaller and the enemy came and I would hear
49:12
those voices. And then then revival broke out and God
49:19
fulfilled the promise and it was a mountaintop and it was I mean it really spoke like I really I
49:27
felt God's love so much. I felt God's love so much when the
49:33
promise was fulfilled. It was like God was speaking to me. you
49:40
were faithful and I can trust you with this.
49:46
I can trust you with this. It It was like God was speaking to me that I have been pleasing him
49:55
and I it was so easy. It was so easy to feel God's love and no condemnation
50:02
on that mountaintop. And then I've seen in a different kind of wilderness in my life after that in a
50:08
different kind of you know waiting on a promise that you believe will come sooner
50:13
I would see the devil try to come back in that same scheme and God opened up my eyes
50:21
the importance of putting on your new self
50:26
cuz there's going to be times on the mountain tops you won't feel any condemnation or whatever thing you used to struggle with it is it you won't feel
50:34
it at you your eyes are so open to God's love and his truth and his ways so open
50:42
but then in the valley there will be a temptation
50:48
the enemy will try to come back in those old ways it's not as natural to feel
50:53
God's love in the valley but the love is the same regardless it taught me when I
50:59
came to that mountaintop of the promise being fulfilled it taught me a lesson for the future Like God was so proud of
51:06
you then. God was so proud of you in the valley,
51:12
but you weren't having these external blessings that showed God's proud of you.
51:20
But it wasn't a sign that you were doing anything wrong because you're in the wilderness.
51:25
This is God's love. He's proud of you. But you have to take the action of
51:30
putting on your new self, of reminding yourself of the knowledge of God, of his
51:36
ways, of the spiritual realm, how the enemy works, how the enemy attacks in a wilderness when you haven't gotten a promise, when it hasn't come to pass yet
51:43
for many years. Um, yeah, the devil's going to try to attack. The devil's going to try to tempt you with impatience, tempt you to complain, tempt
51:50
you with condemnation, thinking you're doing something wrong. The devil's going to try to tempt you
51:56
and make you think like life's not that great. Try to try to try to distract you
52:01
away from seeing how blessed you are right now.
52:07
To have Jesus in your life, to have freedom that you once didn't have
52:13
and all the other different blessings God's given you, provision, family, friends.
52:20
So you you God, this is God's message for you today. He doesn't want you to go backwards. He wants you to continually
52:26
grow in the knowledge of God. But you have to do that work to renew your mind. Continually renew your renew your mind
52:32
with what God has shown you. Amen.
52:37
Praise God.
52:47
Second Peter 1:19. Because of that experience, we have even greater confidence in the message proclaimed by
52:53
the prophets. You must pay close attention to what they wrote, for their words are like a
52:58
lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawn and Christ the morning star
53:04
shines in your hearts. So um one of the one of the areas of
53:12
knowledge of God when it talks about the knowledge of God is talking about his heart.
53:18
But it's also talking about his ways, his spiritual principles.
53:27
Cuz he he doesn't just move and do his work on this earth half-hazardly,
53:32
chaotically, just randomly, but he is truly a god of order. And he
53:39
is a God of principles. He he moves in a certain way,
53:45
in certain ways. And so a big part of this understanding that's that's what
53:51
that is that is the new wine. That is the new wine. When we talk about
53:56
new wine, it's talking about God's ways, God's principles, the secrets of the
54:02
kingdom. When Jesus is talking about the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom,
54:08
it's talking about his ways and his principles.
54:13
to summarize some of his main ways and principles of moving on this earth. One
54:19
of them is that he chooses to use vessels to move in power to put his
54:24
power in and he moves through them like we see with Peter like we see through Paul like we see through all the apostles.
54:31
Another one of his principles, he has a principle of equipping his believers and
54:37
that is for every believer to be planted in one church that God has called them
54:42
to that is anointed that carries truly God's power and the secrets of the
54:47
kingdom, the keys of the kingdom. That's God's way and principle of
54:54
equipping his believers is by believers coming to the church, being true disciples and receiving the teachings,
55:00
equipping through the teachings of anointed servants of God. There's other principles about sewing and reaping.
55:08
There's principles about the power of making sacrifice and what that leads to,
55:14
the reaping that leads to. And I have many teachings of this. This is these
55:20
are I teach about these principles in depth in my book unlock your deliverance and also my YouTube playlist how to
55:26
receive and maintain complete deliverance. But this is part of the knowledge of God
55:32
that's so important is understanding God's ways because that's how you access
55:37
abundant life and that's how you can be a vessel of God truly carrying his power
55:43
and walking in his will. Amen. Amen. And so with one of his principles of how
55:49
he equips the body, one of his principles is how he equips the body is through the five-fold ministry,
55:55
apostles, prophets, evangels, pastors, and teachers according to Ephesians 4. And so this scripture I just read about
56:03
valuing this word coming from the prophets. This is so important to
56:08
gaining this knowledge and to keeping this knowledge.
56:14
This is the humble heart that helps you to gain more knowledge.
56:21
This is how one of the ways you access this knowledge. One of the ways you humble yourself to receive this knowledge is by valuing
56:29
the words of God. This is means the Rama present tense word of God spoken through
56:35
anointed servants of God. You're a leader at the church. So when
56:40
you come to church, you hear the word and you value it as the word of God. You
56:45
take it to heart. You make it priority. You be you are a true disciple who
56:51
studies that word, who meditates on it, who listens to it again, and who truly applies it in their life.
56:59
That's one of the big ways that you will continually grow in the knowledge of God.
57:06
Amen.
