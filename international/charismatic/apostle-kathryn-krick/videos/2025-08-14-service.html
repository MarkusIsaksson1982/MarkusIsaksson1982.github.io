0:00
if you live your Christian life just
0:03
focusing on yourself and just only on
0:06
your relationship with God but not
0:09
working together with the
0:11
body you're missing it you're missing
0:13
your calling you're missing being
0:16
powerful for God and when I say
0:18
relationship with God relationship with
0:20
God includes obedience in every area
0:24
so you can be thinking you're having a
0:26
great relationship with God but if
0:27
you're just focusing on yourself and
0:29
doing everything right you know with
0:31
prayer and reading the Bible only or
0:33
something but you're neglecting the work
0:35
of God you're neglecting being planted
0:38
where God has called you to be planted
0:39
to be part of a body to be part of his
0:42
move if you're neglecting serving others
0:45
if you're neglecting encouraging your
0:48
brothers and sisters if you're
0:49
neglecting taking your part to be
0:52
fed like like being a tree that is
0:55
planted by streams of living water you
0:57
got to take your place to be planted to
0:59
be fed from your spiritual
1:01
leader you have to join forces you have
1:04
to come part of this body of Christ to
1:08
really fulfill your purpose to really
1:11
please God to really be powerful in the
1:17
kingdom god's not interested in the
1:19
notches on your belt of how many people
1:21
have repeated the sinner's prayer to you
1:25
he is interested in what you are doing
1:27
in your part in the body of Christ and
1:30
how you are serving and how you are
1:34
taking your place not individually but
1:37
as a collective member of the body of
1:41
Christ that you are taking your place on
1:43
this body whatever the body part is and
1:46
that you are helping the rest of the
1:48
body not hurting the rest of the body so
1:51
it says in Revelation 12:10 then I heard
1:54
heard a loud voice in heaven say "Now
1:56
have come the salvation and the power
1:59
and the kingdom of our God and the
2:01
authority of his Messiah for the accuser
2:04
of our brothers and sisters who accuses
2:07
them before our God day and night has
2:10
been hurled
2:12
down."
2:14
So what it's speaking right now is that
2:16
the accuser of our brothers and sisters
2:19
who is that is speaking of the devil so
2:22
the devil has certain
2:24
titles that characterize his character
2:30
characterize who he is and what he does
2:33
number one is the father of lies that
2:36
means he's the best at
2:37
lying that means that people who lie
2:40
they're being influenced by
2:43
him the best liar you've ever seen
2:45
they're nothing compared to the devil
2:49
the crafty tricky lies that the devil
2:52
brings are
2:55
top-notch but we as children of God have
2:57
the spirit of God living in us so we
2:59
know what is a lie and what's
3:02
not we can't be fooled by his lies
3:04
because we know the truth we have the
3:07
word of God god has opened our spiritual
3:09
eyes so we're not seen as mere humans
3:12
we're seen as children of God who carry
3:15
the spirit of God but it's important for
3:17
us to know this because you can't be
3:19
lukewarm you can't be carnal and not be
3:22
deceived by the devil's lies you'll be
3:25
deceived it's when you become true
3:27
children of God surrendered that your
3:30
spiritual eyes open
3:32
up just as Jesus said to the disciples
3:35
who first came back from casting out
3:36
demons he praised the father and
3:38
said,"Lord I praise you for hiding these
3:41
things from those who are wise and proud
3:44
and revealing it only to the humble and
3:47
childlike." Another translation says the
3:49
revelation of your authority so so the
3:52
Jesus reveals to us when you are humble
3:55
and childlike that is when God opens
3:58
your spiritual eyes that's when you can
4:01
see the truth that's when you can have
4:03
discernment
4:05
amen jesus would speak many times he
4:08
would say to the Pharisees "I could
4:10
teach you and teach you and teach you
4:12
but you do not even though you have eyes
4:14
and ears your ears won't hear your eyes
4:16
won't
4:19
see because they have made that choice
4:21
to not humble themselves there's no way
4:24
their spiritual eyes can open
4:27
up." All right so we have anyways the
4:29
devil is the father of liars of lies
4:32
that's one of his titles another title
4:35
that the word gives him that God gives
4:37
him in the word is the accuser of the
4:43
brethren accuser of the brethren so what
4:46
that means is that one of the ways he
4:50
lies is by bringing false accusation
4:53
towards children of God towards servants
4:56
of God
4:58
those of you that have been falsely
5:01
accused do you know where that came from
5:05
do you know why the person falsely
5:07
accused
5:08
you because they were
5:11
influenced by the accuser of the
5:16
brethren that's where it came from
5:18
there's a root to everything people
5:20
don't just do things and speak things
5:22
just on their own things like this
5:25
things such as this
5:28
amen so the accuser of the brethren
5:31
falsely accuses believers servants of
5:34
God when you truly stand with Jesus when
5:38
you truly surrender everything to Jesus
5:40
when you truly become an anointed vessel
5:42
of God which is all of your
5:44
callings the the accuser of the brethren
5:47
will falsely accuse
5:51
you that's just going to happen because
5:53
that's what happened to Jesus right
5:57
and it's Jesus living in you when you
5:59
are anointed when you are surrendered
6:02
Jesus is manifested more fully in
6:05
you and you become a threat to the
6:08
devil's kingdom when you are carrying
6:11
Jesus in his fullness when I say Jesus
6:13
in his fullness I mean Jesus who comes
6:15
in power Jesus who destroys yolks Jesus
6:19
who heals the sick and casts out demons
6:21
and raises the dead jesus is is is the
6:24
same yesterday today and forever jesus
6:27
is alive today so did you know that the
6:30
devil is just as afraid of Jesus today
6:34
as he was yesterday as he was when he
6:37
moved through the
6:38
Pharisees and falsely accused him and
6:42
imprisoned him and scorched him and put
6:45
him on a cross to die do you know that
6:48
the devil is just as afraid of Jesus
6:51
today as he was back
6:54
then all of that that took place the the
6:58
persecution of Jesus the lies the false
7:01
accusation was all because the devil was
7:04
terrified of Jesus the devil did not
7:07
want the works of Jesus to continue and
7:11
his kingdom to be destroyed that is the
7:14
root of why all that took place of why
7:17
the Pharisees came against him that is
7:20
the root it's very simple we don't have
7:23
a diluted Jesus
7:25
today we don't have halfway Jesus
7:28
today jesus is the same
7:32
yesterday and
7:35
today and forever he said you will do
7:38
the same things I do and more he says
7:41
when I go it's better that I
7:44
go in his
7:46
time he was moving through one vessel
7:49
the human vessel of
7:51
Jesus
7:53
right but when he sent his Holy Spirit
7:56
to all of his
7:58
disciples he was
8:02
multiplied that's why he says "It's
8:05
better that I go
8:08
it's better that I come by the spirit by
8:11
the Holy
8:13
Spirit than stay here in just one
8:16
body i can do so many more works around
8:20
the world i can deliver and heal so many
8:22
more people i can preach to so many more
8:26
people and they will come and be saved
8:27
come into the kingdom and be saved jesus
8:30
says "You will do the same things I did
8:32
and greater."
8:35
Well when he says you he's really
8:36
meaning the partnership and it's really
8:39
God's power doing everything we're just
8:41
vessels
8:42
amen but so that's what he means he's
8:45
like you and me together but it's really
8:47
my power my power by my I mean God god's
8:50
power plus your
8:52
obedience we will do greater things than
8:56
I did jesus is
8:58
saying "Amen." So Jesus literally said
9:02
"You will do
9:05
greater." Wow so actually I believe that
9:08
the devil's even more terrified today of
9:11
Jesus than he was more than 2,000 years
9:17
ago jesus was limited back then with the
9:21
earthly
9:25
limitations jesus could preach to maybe
9:27
a thousand or so he must have had to
9:29
scream really yell really loud and they
9:32
worked out some sort of e echo chamber
9:35
system or something right but only what
9:38
1,000 or so people a couple thousand or
9:41
a few thousand maybe i don't even know
9:43
how that's possible but they they
9:44
figured it out back
9:45
then could hear his word at one
9:49
time how many today can hear the word
9:52
and can receive deliverance and healing
9:54
today right now how many it could be the
9:57
whole world it could be every person
10:00
across the whole world through social
10:02
media through the
10:05
TV woo i think Jesus is more excited
10:07
than
10:09
ever for his
10:12
work
10:13
hallelujah but that also means the devil
10:16
is more terrified than ever
10:18
before especially prophetically now I
10:21
speak prophetically now that we are in
10:24
revival and the year of acceptance of
10:28
revival because for a while before God's
10:30
appointed timing revival hadn't come yet
10:33
and the power of God was rare but now
10:35
it's become very easy and simple to
10:38
access the power of God thanks to social
10:41
media number one thanks to God opening
10:43
up doors so many millions can know the
10:47
truth now and have seen and tasted the
10:52
power of God as the video popped up on
10:55
their
10:56
screen you also have to be on guard not
10:59
just what God is calling you to is to
11:01
not just be on guard for the devil's
11:04
lies towards you as an
11:06
individual but just as much you need to
11:09
be on guard for the lies of the accuser
11:12
of the brethren not just towards you but
11:15
the the lies of the accuser of the
11:18
brethren towards your brothers and
11:20
sisters towards your leader leaders
11:24
towards other leaders in the body of
11:27
Christ towards moves in the body of
11:29
Christ the move that you're a part of
11:32
the church that you're a part of other
11:34
churches that you're not a part of we
11:36
are one body the body of Christ is
11:39
global the body of Christ is not one
11:41
church one ministry
11:44
we are all one team together it's not
11:47
supposed to be separate
11:49
teams it's not supposed to be the hand
11:52
chopped off of the body doing its thing
11:54
over
11:55
here and the knee downwards chopped off
11:59
doing its thing over
12:01
here it's not going to
12:04
work and God can't do all he wants to do
12:07
when we're operating like that as a body
12:09
of Christ it's good to be very focused
12:12
where you're planted and on what
12:14
specifically God has called you to you
12:16
can put your focus there completely in
12:18
fact that's what God wants because where
12:21
you're planted is where you're being
12:22
equipped is where you received
12:23
impartation it's it's God releasing
12:25
prophetic words of what you need right
12:27
now equipping that's good but never
12:31
forget that you have brothers and
12:33
sisters around the world
12:36
never forget that there are fellow
12:39
servants of God that lead ministries all
12:41
over the
12:43
world and you're over here you're over
12:46
here on this hand you make up a finger
12:48
maybe there's millions of fingers on the
12:51
hand we'll say this church you're a part
12:53
of let's say but there's another church
12:56
over here another ministry over
12:59
here its own hand but you are connected
13:03
you are one body kingdom divided against
13:05
itself cannot
13:07
stand you need to know the scheme of the
13:11
devil the devil knows that the kingdom
13:14
of God the body of Christ will be less
13:18
powerful when we are divided
13:23
if it's just one church over here one
13:25
church over here one church over here
13:27
and they're looking skeptical towards
13:29
another they're speaking against one
13:31
another they're thinking "I'm the only
13:33
right one here we're the only right ones
13:36
here." That's
13:38
division that's not
13:41
unity and God can still move god can
13:44
still do works i mean even before there
13:46
was revival and his power of God was
13:48
rare he was still moving people were
13:50
still being saved
13:53
so he can still move but he can't do all
13:56
that he wants to do if we would actually
13:59
be
14:00
united fighting against each other is
14:03
like wounding one
14:05
another when we're supposed to
14:07
strengthen one another we're supposed to
14:08
lift one another up off the ground we're
14:11
supposed to when someone's limping
14:14
because the devil's attack so strong
14:17
because they're being used powerfully by
14:19
God you're supposed to put your arm
14:21
under the person put their arm around
14:23
them and help them keep marching
14:26
forward but what we have in the body of
14:29
Christ so often is instead helping the
14:33
devil beat down the
14:35
person the
14:38
opposite god's not pleased with that
14:41
god
14:42
sees we can't hide that from God and
14:46
this is a serious thing and we could be
14:49
so individually minded so self-focused
14:51
and everything's going great
14:53
everything's going good and you're doing
14:54
all these good things with your own
14:55
personal life but if you're pushing down
15:00
another it's combating the good you're
15:03
doing you know it's not something to
15:07
take lightly and this isn't preached
15:09
much I don't think in the body of Christ
15:11
and this isn't taken seriously much in
15:13
the body of Christ the devil has
15:15
infiltrated these lies so so
15:18
strongly trying to get us to forget that
15:21
we are part of a body and we are
15:24
stronger when we stand
15:26
united and we are not called to push one
15:29
another down but pick each other up and
15:32
help and strengthen one another amen
