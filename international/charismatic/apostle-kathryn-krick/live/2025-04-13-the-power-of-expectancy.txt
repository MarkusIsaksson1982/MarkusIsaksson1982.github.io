powerful and important for you to share what God has done hopefully I won't pass out cuz um Do I need to say anything you
35:38
guys have seen it online right no a lot of people don't
35:43
watch this is why I brought you here up here because I know a lot of people they don't see every video so yes I know you
35:50
you shared your testimony a few weeks ago here and then something happened that day yes miraculous okay
36:00
all right lord help me all right hopefully I won't break down because I did not break down the whole time so I
36:07
testified last Sunday you guys heard about my story last five years was the hardest uh a few Sundays ago right two
36:16
Sundays ago yes two Sundays ago i was honestly like super happy how God had
36:23
moved since I got planted here at 5F last December and so we went to the
36:31
beach had a bonfire with a lot of the 5F family thank you for welcoming me you
36:36
guys are just awesome phenomenal people and I was doing a video to promote your video after I posted it online I got a
36:44
text from my kids they're like "Oh what all this 911 and fire trucks in the neighborhood?" And I'm like "Wait what?"
36:51
And then 10 minutes later he's like "Oh it's Aiden he's having seizures." So
36:56
Aiden had had like my son my middle child um three seizures in his life the
37:02
last one was 2021 so this never happened okay so then I'm like "Okay what
37:09
happened?" I called I called them up right away and my son Andrew who was
37:15
here got prayed for he's like Aiden's gone he's they're trying to revive him
37:22
and I don't know i'm like "Son pray for him." Like you know how Apostle Pray
37:27
pray right now let's pray together so there were like about eight nine people
37:33
trying to revive my son my my husband is already trying to revive him for at least 10 minutes and it was nothing
37:38
right so nobody knew what's going on and we didn't know if it's seizure whatever so then um we were praying the whole
37:46
time and everyone's like enough of that you know we need to focus on reviving
37:52
him so I was like okay Andrew okay enough we've said our prayer we're going to trust Jesus on this and then I
37:58
immediately hop in to the car i was gonna go to Las Vegas for a conference
38:04
and I had to take the last flight and I texted I think a lot of you and
38:09
somebody's like do you want me to tell Apostle i'm like please let him let her know because she's got the anointing we
38:14
need that you know um not like I don't have faith but the anointing you have it
38:20
you you carry it i mean we have like a little bit of anointing but I think you have like extravagant anointing so and
38:28
the prayer of a righteous man avails much i believe that so much so so I think you you pray you prayed because I
38:36
got a message and your words you said "Do not fear god is healing him and
38:44
protecting him." That literally like washed over me so much and I'm a very
38:53
frantic person i'm a type A i get my emotions are like it goes really wild in
38:59
in a second for some reason I was at peace i was just you know and then I was trying to
39:07
buy a ticket good thing my friend bought me a ticket um because I was just like I don't know what to do and then as I was
39:14
going to the to the plane Jesus reminded me of Lazarus i don't know why i'm like
39:20
wait Lazarus jesus he died you were late you were late and it doesn't mean I'm
39:26
late but nevertheless Lord you go before me do not allow the enemy to win in
39:32
Jesus' name because Apostle said you're protecting him and you're healing him so
39:38
I trust you but nevertheless not my will but your
39:46
will i would never imagine I would utter those words as a mom i mean a lot of you
39:52
are moms you would never want your child to go right but I trusted Jesus so my
39:58
mind was like I am perfect Diane i am good trust in my goodness i'm like yes
40:04
Lord i love you i thank you you're with Aiden right now and a lot of my friends
40:09
they're like yeah they they're like telling me like yeah during that time we don't feel good about Eden and we all
40:15
know and then that time you also prayed for
40:21
someone that had a rupture in their body around the same time so
40:27
Aiden was having a severe pain on his stomach around 3:00 and usually at the
40:33
end of the service you pray for everyone and around 3:30 or so that's when you prayed
40:39
so I mean guys people in the world this is where the anointing is um be planted
40:46
here come here it's totally worth it i don't care how much you're going to pay worth it to be here because the the will
40:53
and the power of God is here it's with Apostle and I cannot I cannot even
41:00
imagine so anyway so something ruptured something ruptured inside and this never
41:05
happened very rare occurrence and Saturday night I posted and I tagged 5F
41:11
about are you ready to be a vessel for God Saturday night sun remember it happened Sunday right so you know how
41:18
Apostle always talks about powerful vessel we are the vessels of God i'm like wait rapture vessel like think
41:27
about it guys i'm like thinking pondering about this reeling in I'm like what are you talking about what are you
41:33
trying to do here right we are all called to be vessel of God so um so they
41:38
were able to revive him at least about probably 25 minutes so they finally brought him to the hospital they could
41:45
not find where the the bleeding literally Aiden bled to death already at this point right cuz his stomach is a
41:51
aching at 2:00 3:00 when it got all severe then ended up in emergency praise
41:57
God cuz the guy that literally probably the only one in Portland that knows how to do this surgery he was available he
42:03
came they had to do three surgeries they were gonna transfer him to the children's hospital and could not make
42:09
it like oh it's still bleeding they could not find so the vessel like a huge vessel by his spleen and the surgeon's
42:17
like this never happened before i'm like I kind of know why vessel yeah um so uh
42:24
does that make sense is that making sense to you all right so anyway um transferred him to the children's
42:31
hospital i got in about 1 oneish and I hopping into the car and Tyler's like
42:38
"Why are you so at peace?" I'm like "Why god is in control jesus got Aiden." He's
42:43
like "Yeah." I'm like "I'm going to lose it i'm going to pass out." He's like "Did you know that he died?" And I'm
42:49
like "Yeah I knew cuz he reminded me about Lazarus i knew but I knew he was also in control." He's like "How do you
42:56
have this type of confidence and peace?" I'm like "I don't know either but ask Jesus i think he knows um so so we
43:05
hopped in got into the hospital and still like Aiden was out for the next
43:12
two days I would say so nobody knew what if his brain is dead again nobody knows
43:18
what's organs are all like they open him up like literally the biggest cut in the world because they couldn't find the the
43:23
bleeding so right when I got into his bedside I played your deliverance video and all
43:31
the nurses like there's like almost like eight to 10 people all the time around his best it's like what is that oh it's
43:38
a deliverance prayer literally Jesus will heal anyone that will hear this and they're
43:44
like "Sure." I'm like "No 100% believe it." I'm like "Believe it it's it's real
43:50
it's true." And so we we played it and then the whole night it's not like I'm
43:55
not believing in God but I just literally scoured all the healing ver Bible verses and spoke over it over
44:01
Aiden i did not sleep for the next 30 30 hours and just really like I feel like
44:06
the 5F family you Apostle and John we battled this together and Jesus is
44:12
victorious i mean literally like he's dead he's he's he's over with and the
44:19
it's I was telling you it's crescendoing to the rise rise and shine how God has really showed his resurrected power that
44:27
we've I've never seen before i'm like asking him why Lord why me i'm like who am I why are you showing this to me i
44:35
still have to realize and and see where God is going to bring me about this but
44:42
literally like my in-laws like my father-in-law and I I told my family this like "Guys I promise God that I'm
44:50
his for life so don't don't be stopping me from it cuz I kind of promise him
44:55
that I am his for life." And then my father-in-law was like "Yeah me too." And I'm like "Good." Cuz he's Catholic
45:01
and doesn't believe much in this you know and I'm like "Good." So even if
45:07
that moment only saved my father-in-law who is very close to Aiden it was totally worth it because I know that he
45:14
saved his life and I am just in awe and wonder how much
45:20
higher what God's power can he reveal to us before we
45:27
believe him how like and he healed him fast like all the surgeon every time they come in
45:33
the morning they're like I said are we going home today and they're like weeks or months and I'm like I declare so I I
45:40
told you I declare guys ever since you get planted every time I declare something it's
45:46
almost like 99.9% it happens i don't know why do you know why i don't know
45:52
why um I said I declare Lord I'm buying my ticket honestly I was annoyed cuz the
45:58
devil like break my streak to coming here four weeks in a row and I was like coming the fifth week i was annoyed by
46:05
that more than anything guys i was super annoyed by that but I said I declared
46:10
that in the next few days two to three days that Aiden will be released and Tyler's like "You're right." That's like
46:17
almost asking Portland to be sunshine right now it never you know never uh
46:23
shine bright in in Portland next two days i said "I'm gonna buy my ticket i don't care i'll let go my ticket if I
46:28
cannot come to LA." Guess what happened next two days the surgeon's
46:35
like "Wow Eden you're eating you're walking you're doing all of this." It's like "What's happening?" I'm like "It's
46:41
Jesus." I said "It's Jesus." So
47:01
So so the surgeon all of them what this significant recovery supersonic speed
47:09
like honestly guys a lot of Apostle's words it's almost like alive i don't know about you but supersonic speed yeah
47:16
I've heard that before apostle says that the recovery was significantly fast no
47:23
brain damage no heart damage and he's back to his sarcastic self like his mom
47:33
and just honestly in all I don't know
47:38
like I'm still re reeling in on how much God has moved but I think that Jesus is
47:47
moving in a level right now that is going to break loose and
47:53
it's going to go all over the earth and 5F is leading the way apostle is going
48:00
to lead the way because he is showing his great might the manifestation the
48:05
grand display of his power and love have you seen it like this before i have not
48:11
i have not so only here only through apostles so I am just in awe January at
48:18
December 11 when I saw your Instagram post and I want to be that kind of like
48:23
on the top of the mountain how you declared look back on how much God has done for us how much God has done to 5F
48:32
like this is like everybody's like oh this is probably the first resurrection that we know of i I tell them like that
48:37
you guys know of i'm sure God has resurrected some people before that we don't even know but maybe it was the
48:44
Aiden was the first one that we know of but I'm pretty sure there's a lot more i truly believe that and I don't know
48:52
Apostle i think you've got it you've got the anointing so everyone please you know
49:01
I'm like a baby Christian on the Jesus way i thought I knew Jesus before but
49:06
just different levels of understanding and revealing God's love
49:11
um I I I cannot thank you enough your words are just alive and they bring life
49:19
to us to a lot of us and I wouldn't be here as a mom i probably had a heart
49:25
attack already if I wasn't planted here or Aiden um like I was thinking like one
49:32
of my agents dad was also in the ICU and he did not make it but he's a true believer for God i was like thinking God
49:38
oh my God you saved Aiden and you know Aiden I asked him did you go did you go
49:44
to heaven did you say hi to my mom and dad i hope you did and it's like mom and he said yeah I was floating
49:51
already i was floating i was like son we fought for you apostle fought for you
49:56
the whole five family fought for you we brought you down and Jesus brought you down because he wants to display his
50:04
power and his love to everybody not just
50:09
to me to all of us to all of us please believe Jesus
50:16
hallelujah hallelujah praise God thank you
50:25
Jesus thank you Jesus we are in awe and wonder of you Jesus thank you for coming
50:30
and sharing the testimony just like a week or so after all of this or not even
50:37
you just got out of the hospital when uh 10th day so three days ago a few days
50:43
ago days ago and he's planning to go back to school Monday [Laughter]
50:49
wow jesus look what he has done right right before Resurrection Sunday right
50:55
before Easter Jesus has done this miracle thank you Lord you know God is
51:00
so proud of you and you have been serving God so powerfully you have been
51:06
sharing his good news of deliverance and his power through the book through both
51:13
of the books so wildly so powerfully and the devil is afraid of you and the devil
51:20
wants to stop me and the devil wants to slow you
51:25
down the devil doesn't like what you are doing so he tried to slow you down he
51:31
tried to stop you he tried to dampen your spirit he tried to bring doubt and tried to stifle the fire and God allowed
51:39
this as a test because he will never give you what you can't handle and he
51:44
saw you could handle this and just as Lazarus's family his sisters they were
51:51
disciples of Jesus and they could handle that test of their beloved brother dying
51:57
for a moment jesus knew they could handle that and they had the honor for that
52:04
testimony and glory to be revealed through their family through their faith and so just as the saying this is the
52:10
Bible come alive as you are a true disciple of Jesus like how Lazarus's sisters were Mary and Martha you were
52:18
like them and so God is glorified through this and what the enemy intended
52:23
for harm God intended for good so that more people may believe in him that he
52:31
can even raise the dead hallelujah so I am proud of you for
52:37
standing strong i am proud of you for standing strong with great faith and no
52:43
fear i am proud of you god is so proud of you we are proud of you you amen
52:51

53:45
artist uh very talented and he wants to give this to you can you describe so
53:53
basically can you So basically Aiden uh depicted the anointing it's about life
54:01
with and without the anointing so without the anointing of God it's dark
54:07
it's gray it's sad and then with the anointing with God it's full of life
54:15
vibrant happy full of life God's blessings and
54:21
goodness and color and beautiful and this is you want to read it my accent is
54:30
too thick oh dear apostle thank you for your prayers and support i created this piece to reflect God's anointing on your
54:36
life the power to crush yolks bring deliverance and revive lives oh after
54:42
reading your book on the anointing I was inspired to show the difference between a life with God's presence and one without your ministry has touched me
54:49
deeply especially after my surgery and God's display of his power by reviving me and this drawing is a way of honoring
54:56
that with gratitude Aiden oh so beautiful so beautiful wow how old is he
55:04

55:46
is and this is what he's commanded us to do to preach the gospel to heal the sick to cast out demons and to raise the
55:55
dead praise God because there's some sometimes attacks of the enemy to bring
56:01
death prematurely and this is why we must raise the dead we must be used by God to
56:07
raise the dead because God has great plans for these people's lives for Aiden's life where he will use them

56:45
to see you here hun i think you might have shared here at some point a while ago but I would love for you to share
56:51
your testimony of how God has touched you by the power of God yes yeah oh thank you Apostle um yeah I just want to
56:58
first of all think like just really want to thank you and honor you for all that you do because because of this anointing
57:04
like my whole life and my family's life has just been changed so much um so in
57:10
around July 2022 um I was going through a really dry season with God um I would
57:16
just I was doing all the Christian things like praying fasting um but I just felt so dry um I just felt like my
57:24
relationship with God was just so stagnant um and so I started to just
57:29
scroll through social media because I was I was just I think I was just wasting time scrolling through social
57:35
media cuz I had nothing else to do um and then so um as I was scrolling through I I came across a video of you
57:42
in the park and it was you um like I just saw like there was a woman that was
57:47
in the park and she just started to um manifest and I was like whoa what's
57:53
happening and um and then I just saw you just with such um just uh just like such
57:59
Christlikkeness and just just so like simplistically like just commanding the demon to go and then the demon left the
58:06
woman just just so easily and I was like wow like my eyes just opened up and it
58:13
was like that moment I was like wow this is like the Bible come alive like this is like the Acts church that I've been
58:19
reading my whole life but I've just never seen it in my whole life and and then so from there I just started
58:25
watching more of your videos um and so um so at that time I was I had a lot of
58:31
insecurities um grew up didn't didn't grow up in a um like great family so it
58:36
was um I just had a lot of trauma and a lot of um insecurities and I constantly heard the voice of um you're not good
58:43
enough um like just it was so loud it was like constantly every time I tried
58:48
to step out for God or just do something um out of my comfort zone like I would just hear that voice saying "You're not
58:54
good enough you're not good enough." Um and so I just grew up with that and I just felt like that was that was that
58:59
was part of me and so I watched one of your videos on um uh how to it was like
59:05
around how to overcome insecurities um and so I watched one of that and then at the end you declare like a simple prayer
59:12
and um you talked about how to um like reject the lies of the devil and declare
59:17
the truth over our lives and so I did that and so um yeah and so I guess one
59:24
part of it was around I I kept doing that and after around about a year I started to realize that all those voices
59:30
were gone like I was like wow like I like hardly hear that voice anymore like that says you're not good enough like
59:37
it's it's just I just feel like my mind is so clear and um and even when it does come occasionally I just reject it and I
59:43
declare the truth over my life and I just feel like I just really thank God for um having that revelation because
59:51
it's completely changed my life and then the other thing I really want to testify was um before I started watching your
59:57
videos um I was really addicted to watching anime and um manga so these Japanese kind of dramas I was just so um
1:00:05
like into it because I was trying to fill a void inside of me um and I but I knew that God didn't want me to watch
1:00:11
those things and so I um yeah so that's what I was dealing with and I realized
1:00:16
that after just even that one video from the start that I started that I saw your video that I haven't been back to those
1:00:22
videos at all now and it's been like so since 2022 so like two two and a half
1:00:28
years now i just haven't been back to that at all i have zero desire for those things like negative like those things
1:00:33
like repulse me now like I don't want those want to like go to those things so I just praise God i just really thank
1:00:41
God for setting me free from that um and the other thing I really want to testify is um my family um so growing up like um
1:00:50
there was just a lot of disunityity in my family um and then like it just felt like after I started watching um her
1:00:57
videos it was like the anointing just like started to seep through every area of my life and into my family so in 2023
1:01:06
um a few things happened so my parents separated but um like it was such a like
1:01:12
God just used that like what the enemy meant for um for evil like God used it for good so because of that like um my
1:01:19
mom is now a Christian like shortly after that happened like she became like she accepted Christ and I was like yeah
1:01:25
praise God and I was like wow what happened and she said I think I don't even remember but she said I I think I
1:01:31
sent her um like a post that you posted around um just like how to like um like
1:01:37
become Christian like how to accept Jesus that it's really um you know like we like believe in our hearts and like
1:01:43
confess that he is Lord um so I sent that to her and she said because of that she she saw that post she just in her
1:01:48
heart in her own time just said like Jesus I want to I want to accept you into my life and I was like wow praise
1:01:55
God yeah praise God yeah really praise God and um just one last one too my
1:02:01
sister also she was not a Christian never been to church um was never like open before um the first time that I so
1:02:10
when you came to revival is now um Melbourne i went there and um so I really wanted to bring someone with me i
1:02:16
didn't want to go by myself so I like like really like begged my sister to come with me um even though she's not
1:02:22
Christian and then so she she did come with me in the end and I saw that during that time like she encountered God even
1:02:28

1:06:34
amen hallelujah all right so
1:06:42
um now I I want to share another exciting announcement that happened this week
1:06:49
um Pastor Heather shared it in the announcements as well i know many of you already seen it but I just wanted to share this with all of you at 5F my 5F
1:06:56
family here um God really shocked me and really surprised me this week uh just on
1:07:02
Thursday as I found out that my book Unlock Your Deliverance made the USA Today bestseller list glory to God glory
1:07:11
to God glory to God at number 26 out of
1:07:18
150 and I was so shocked i didn't expect that i I I I I mean at least in the
1:07:25
timing it was a complete shock and I was even more shocked when I scrolled through the list i was looking at the
1:07:30
other books on the list and from what I could see with a quick scrolling um it looked like it might be the only
1:07:37
Christian book on on that list which can only be
1:07:44
God amen and praise God and it's so
1:07:50
prophetic of this year what God is doing the year of acceptance because for so
1:07:55
long the Christianity that was accepted in the world in the US was Christianity
1:08:02
without deliverance without the power of God right there's been so much attack so much
1:08:09
religious attack uh blockages barriers in the spiritual
1:08:15
realm holding back God's revival holding back the move of God to bring freedom
1:08:21
but this is the year of acceptance where God breaks those barriers down and where
1:08:27
the revival army cannot be contained or held back
1:08:32
hallelujah and so this is so prophetic and another open door where God has shocked us to
1:08:39
bring this acceptance of his move the acceptance of his power and freedom amen
1:08:46
hallelujah glory to God glory to God and I I I thank you this was God's doing
1:08:53
completely and the revival army you all you're all doing
1:08:59
um you know what God really what this what this really showed me i God has
1:09:06
always spoken this to me and he's spoken this to me a lot this year he's spoken this to me a lot the past a little bit
1:09:12
more than a month um where there has been a lot of spiritual attack about 40 days actually there has been there had
1:09:18
been a lot of spiritual attack once God started opening up doors new doors like
1:09:23
never before in this year of acceptance god has been speaking to me there are more for you than against you there are
1:09:31
more on God's army the angel army than the devil's army there are more um but
1:09:41
you know this is a spiritual reality this is a spiritual reality that there's
1:09:46
more meaning like we can't see the angels physically we can only see them by faith
1:09:54
it's a spiritual sight that we see them right and so that being said that this revelation that there are more for us
1:10:01
than against us this revelation will keep on increasing as God blesses us
1:10:07
with signs and evidence right amen and so I was so blessed to have an increase
1:10:14
of this revelation through God doing this miracle this showed me that there
1:10:20
are more for us than those against us amen
1:10:25
this showed me that there are more people who want to seek God and find
1:10:31
more of him there are more people who are desperate for freedom and don't care about all the
1:10:38
religiousness and what the Pharisees have to say they just want Jesus they
1:10:43
just want freedom and so they're going to seek out how to find freedom and more
1:10:50
of Jesus and they're going to get the book amen
1:10:56
it doesn't matter what the Pharisees have to say amen they don't care they
1:11:02
want Jesus they want freedom they want abundant life hallelujah and it doesn't matter if
1:11:09
you're a child in the Lord baby Christian or uh a mature believer if you have a pure heart you can see the truth
1:11:16
because the children belong to the kingdom of God so the ch that means the
1:11:21
children can see the truth they can see the spiritual truth they can see that the lies of the Pharisees are lies
1:11:27
indeed amen and this it also showed me that there is a revival army that is big
1:11:34
who is who are passionate to spread this message of
1:11:39
freedom of the keys of the kingdom that release freedom and abundant life
1:11:46
so I know you have so much to do with this partnering with God for this book
1:11:51
to be in this place to be more visible this is what's so exciting about this is that this book is now way more visible
1:11:58
to others who wouldn't have seen it without this happening and they are
1:12:05
going to be drawn to it and find Jesus and find Jesus the deliverer in this book
1:12:10
amen praise God praise God um you know I
1:12:17
uh I that the day that I found out Thursday um it was really early in the morning
1:12:24
like it's just it was just such a busy day that I didn't end up going to bed till really late and just spending time
1:12:31
with God and just praising him and and everything and so it was it was really like late at night or rather really
1:12:37
early in the morning when the Holy Spirit prompted me to look into the bib
1:12:43
bib he prompted me to to see the bib biblical significance of the number
1:12:49
26 and so instead of going to sleep I I I I was led to Psalms 26 and I was in
1:12:58
awe as I read this Psalms from David vindicate me Lord for I have led a
1:13:04
blameless life i have trusted in the Lord and have not faltered test me Lord and try me examine my heart and my mind
1:13:10
for I have always been mindful of your unfailing love and have lived in reliance on your faithfulness i do not
1:13:15

1:13:21
with the wicked i wash my hands in innocence and go about your altar Lord proclaiming aloud your praise and
1:13:26
telling all your wonderful deeds lord I love the house where you live the place where your glory dwells do not take away

1:13:46
ground in the great congregation i will praise the Lord
1:13:51
hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus and this you know I've
1:13:56
never resonated with these words i've never resonated with David's words as
1:14:02
much as I have these past 40 days and I actually just yesterday was led i was like how many there there ever since it
1:14:09
was like immediately when God opened up a door the door of media the door of
1:14:16
sharing his message of revival and deliverance and his power in new places
1:14:22
higher places that reach more people like TV it was immediate that the devil became very angry and tried to stop what
1:14:30
God was doing and so I felt led just yesterday to count the number of days
1:14:38
um ever since that first one happened and then it it the enemy kept coming in
1:14:43
this way and it was 40 days from the first time uh the first attack in this
1:14:51
year of acceptance um till when that the book was number 26 um it was 40 days
1:15:00
which 40 has so much significance um it's a it's prophetic significance in
1:15:05
the word it I 40 days in the wilderness Jesus Jesus spent 40 years in the in in
1:15:12
the wilderness the Israelites spent so it's a time of testing it's a time of wilderness is a time of waiting on the
1:15:19
Lord for vindication and for victory over the enemy for the um the manifestation of
1:15:26
the victory over the enemy even though we know we have the spiritual victory always
1:15:32
amen so um the Lord just spoke to me that this was prophetic sign there
1:15:37
wasn't a coincidence to that number um 26 that God is bringing victory and
1:15:45
vindication to his move now to 5F church now in this season in this week in this
1:15:52
wonderful amazing powerful week where he's going to split the sea at a rise and shine conference he's already begun
1:15:59
this victory it's now begun glory to God
1:16:04
hallelujah hallelujah glory to God
1:16:11
all right we're going to get into the word right now happy Palm Sunday everyone
1:16:19
matthew 21:9 it says "The crowds that went ahead of him of Jesus and those
1:16:24
that followed him were shouting in praise and adoration hosana to the son
1:16:31
of David Messiah." This is amplified version so it's giving meaning of what they're saying messiah they're declaring
1:16:38
he's the Messiah blessed praised glorified is he who comes in the name of the Lord hosana
1:16:45
in the highest heaven when he entered Jerusalem all the city was trembling with excitement saying "Who is this?"
1:16:53
And the crowds were saying "This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee."
1:17:02
So thousands of people were praising
1:17:07
Jesus as Lord as the Messiah they saw spiritually who he
1:17:16
really was and they were praising him they were being completely in the spirit
1:17:22
they were pleasing God they were seeing him rightly and doing what God wanted
1:17:28
them to do giving him praise and proclaiming and announcing that he is
1:17:35
Lord that he is Messiah hallelujah they were living in the truth
1:17:44
and they were able to receive from him because of their faith they were able to receive miracles from him they were able
1:17:51
to receive great joy because they simply had
1:17:57
faith and they were they were they were doing their works in of faith in action
1:18:05
praising him not quietly believing from afar but they were praising him they
1:18:12
were demonstrating faith and it was quite it's quite simple to demonstrate faith believe in your heart and confess
1:18:20
that's how that's what's measured as faith which leads to salvation and going to heaven is when you believe in your
1:18:28
heart that Jesus is Lord and confess with your mouth but this is the same principle for everything the same
1:18:33
principle to receiving everything from God to it's the same principle of receiving miracles of receiving peace
1:18:39
and joy and all that God gives it's the same principle believe in your heart and confess
1:18:47
i praise you Lord i believe you are the Messiah i believe
1:18:53
you are my healer i believe you are my deliverer i believe by his stripes I am
1:18:59
healed that's what's counted as faith not what
1:19:04
the devil's speaking in your mind not the feelings you're having you can have the opposite kind of feelings but in
1:19:11
your heart you believe and you choose to speak the
1:19:18
devil can be shouting in your head the opposite you won't be healed i believe you are my
1:19:24
healer i believe I will receive healing that's what God counts as faith as the
1:19:31
Bible says believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord it doesn't say believe your
1:19:36
feelings it doesn't say whatever your feelings are saying that's what God
1:19:42
counts as faith and which leads to salvation because your feelings are influenced by the devil many times so
1:19:49
that's why the devil that's why God doesn't look at your feelings because
1:19:54
God knows that's how the devil comes god knows we're in a battle god doesn't judge us for being in a battle he
1:20:01
allowed us to be in a battle he put us on this earth to be warriors in this battle so to be going by your to be to be
1:20:08
thinking that God is judging you by your feelings is like being a warrior sent
1:20:14
out to battle and and thinking that the general is angry at you that there's
1:20:21
weapons being formed against you and you have bruises from being in
1:20:28
battle this this is what happens these are re this is what happens when we are
1:20:35
in battle when we are in battle there will be feelings sometimes that the enemy is influencing we reject them and
1:20:42
we choose the truth that's all we got to do amen hallelujah all right so on Palm
1:20:50
Sunday the what we are celebrating today on this day the crowds were praising God
1:20:56
and they were living in the truth and they were able to partake of this great joy they were able to receive joy that
1:21:03
Jesus was releasing as he came into town they were able to receive that joy that
1:21:09
peace they were able to receive that the presence of God and heaven and earth
1:21:14
because they were living in the truth and praising him amen
1:21:24
but just a few days later just a few days later Jesus was
1:21:33
betrayed by Judas which led him to be
1:21:38
imprisoned falsely i mean for no reason for no um
1:21:45
valid reason he's falsely accused imprisoned tortured beaten
1:21:55
scorged and the closest disciples to him dispersed the very closest denied him
1:22:00
three times they dispersed they ran away they hid they
1:22:05
didn't they didn't proclaim in the city "He's truly the Messiah and this is
1:22:13
wrong don't you know what you're doing think twice because he is Lord they didn't do that they they acted
1:22:22
completely differently than they were on the Sunday on the on the day they were
1:22:28
praising him saying hosana and then he was brought to the
1:22:35
cross to be crucified on Friday
1:22:42
and at the cross there was just three
1:22:50
disciples mary mother of Jesus Mary Magdalene and
1:22:56
John thousands thousands praising him a few days earlier
1:23:05
thousands not just praising him but proclaiming Messiah
1:23:12
you are the Messiah you are truly the son of God and we praise
1:23:19
you and all of those thousands of people except for three stopped
1:23:25
praising some denied the rest hid and we're not praising and we're not
1:23:34
proclaiming he is the Messiah
1:23:40
and what's wild is that most of the
1:23:45
praise and worship songs that have ever been written up to this day contain
1:23:51
words about the
1:23:56
cross but at the cross there was three of thousands there was
1:24:03
point whatever the percentage is 0.1% 01% something like
1:24:08
this of his followers who were praising him so in the time where he became even
1:24:15
more worthy of praise the most worthy of praise no one but three were there to
1:24:22
praise him but was G did Jesus change did Jesus
1:24:30
himself change from when they were praising him one day to when they were
1:24:36
not and were hiding and were not proclaiming he was Lord jesus did not
1:24:43
change jesus became actually even more beautiful and more worthy of praise even more worthy of praise if that's even a
1:24:50
thing because he's always the most high God worthy of the most praises but if he's to be even more worthy he was even
1:24:58
more worthy at this point
1:25:04
so these these people were praising him one day and receiving so much joy they
1:25:11
could have been receiving miracles i'm sure they were receiving miracles because there's so many miracles in the Bible that were not recorded the Bible
1:25:17
says that so you know if people were just coming under the shadow of Peter and being healed and delivered how about
1:25:23
when they were praising him with their palms as he's walking by praising Jesus
1:25:29
I'm sure many miracles were taking place so one day they decide to reject the
1:25:34
devil's lies and believe the truth although it was easy that day it was comfortable they didn't have to reject the lies very much the Pharisees were
1:25:41
around but it wasn't so hard to reject the devil it was so wasn't so uncomfortable to reject the devil's lies
1:25:46
that day so when it was comfortable and easy to reject the any kind of devil lie
1:25:51
and when it's a popular thing to do to praise God they're there praising God and receiving miracles
1:25:59
but when it becomes uncomfortable to stand with Jesus to praise him to proclaim that he is
1:26:08
Messiah they're nowhere to be found now yes it would be uncomfortable but they
1:26:14
would have been pleasing God they would have been honored forever in the Bible like
1:26:22
the three were the three are they would have been receiving the presence of God
1:26:27
and miracles even in this solemn time they would have been in the presence of
1:26:34
God so it is worth it was would definitely have been worth it i'm sure
1:26:39
Mary Mary both Mary's and John would say to you today it was
1:26:45
worth all of the the hardship and it being uncomfortable and persecution of
1:26:50
being there and worshiping Jesus at the cross it was worth it
1:26:59
jesus didn't change but people but people believe the
1:27:04
devil's lies and be it became more uncomfortable and they missed out on receiving from God and pleasing
1:27:12
God it's like this this $20 bill is valuable you can
1:27:20
bring it anywhere and anywhere will accept it in America at least and actually other
1:27:26
several other countries will even accept it it's that valuable even though it's not their currency if you bring it you know
1:27:32
several nations they will they will do that they'll just take it they don't say you have to go to a
1:27:38
bank and exchange it some nations it's so valuable and it looks pretty it looks
1:27:44
nice it looks flat right now right and it's valuable it's worth $20
1:27:49
but if I crumple
1:27:55
it and I drop it on the ground and I stomp on it with my shoes that have been on dirt and who knows
1:28:11
what it is still the same $20 bill it is just as valuable the value
1:28:18
did not go down at all and I can still bring it anywhere and they will accept it they will they will gladly accept it
1:28:26
they will not say it's wrinkly i'll only accept $15 of
1:28:35
it it's the same value and so many people
1:28:41
they they'll worship Jesus they will lift their faith to receive from Jesus
1:28:47
when things are nice and pretty when it's comfortable to worship
1:28:55
Jesus to gather and to gather together and receive from
1:29:01
him but when it's uncomfortable and not as
1:29:06
pretty even though they can be receiving just as much just the same even though
1:29:12
God is pleased just the same and even more many people are not here to worship
1:29:18
Jesus and receive from him in these times
1:29:31
so I share this this um principle here with you about how God never
1:29:39
changes because this is an important revelation for you to understand because
1:29:45
God wants you to continually be receiving from him
1:29:50
worshiping him serving him and receiving from him always every single day
1:29:58
every single day he wants you to enter into his presence the Holy Spirit never leaves
1:30:05
you but there's a difference between entering into his presence by acknowledging that he is here with you
1:30:12
and putting your eyes to him renewing your mind there's a difference between
1:30:17
that and going about your days and not doing those things that's not entering into his presence right so every single
1:30:25
day he wants you to enter into his presence every single day he wants you to be receiving his perfect peace that
1:30:32
never leaves isaiah 26:3 you will keep in perfect
1:30:40
peace all who trust in you all whose thoughts are fixed on
1:30:47
you so when we choose to keep our eyes on Jesus every single day guess what we
1:30:56
can receive perfect peace every single day no matter the circumstance no matter
1:31:03
what the enemy is trying to throw at you you can receive the same exact perfect
1:31:09
peace every single day every single day God never changes god stays the same
1:31:20
always he is the same yesterday today and forever
1:31:26
and many people think on good days God is there and on bad days God's not there
1:31:32
but that is wrong just like Jesus was still Lord on the
1:31:38
donkey on the when the palms they were waving and when he went upon that
1:31:44
cross the perspective before was glorious oh look how everyone's praising
1:31:50
him and the sun is shining and he's riding on a donkey and it's such a
1:31:55
joyous environment he is Lord and then it looks
1:32:01
like to people defeat as he's going on a cross but that was his most victorious
1:32:07
moment that was the most powerful moment that was the most powerful thing
1:32:14
he's ever done more powerful than that moment of the palms
1:32:21
but that's how it is in life with many people the good days Palm Sunday the
1:32:26
good days god is good god is here god is present in my life i feel his presence i
1:32:33
have joy i have peace life is good i am blessed and on those days like
1:32:41
Jesus going on the cross where is God the devil's winning so distracted that
1:32:48
you can't even enter into his presence so distracted that you can't even lift your faith to receive what God has for
1:32:55
you to receive peace joy miracles god is the same every single
1:33:02
day he's never condemning you but many people think when they are you know on a
1:33:09
roll in being in the word on the roll keeping doors shut on a roll serving God
1:33:15
going to church when they're on a roll they think God is just like I am so
1:33:20
proud of you and then if they make a mistake or even if they don't make a
1:33:26
mistake but the devil comes with a lie of condemnation religious condemnation
1:33:32
that's not even like he's condemning you for no reason you did nothing wrong because he's the accuser of the brethren
1:33:39
many people think now God's like this condemning you how could you i'm disappointed with
1:33:46
you but the truth is is that when you're on feeling like you're on a roll and
1:33:52
doing great as a follower of God God is like this i'm so proud of you i love you
1:33:58
so much i am cheering you on i am for you not against you i have
1:34:06
great plans for your life i am fighting every battle for you and he's the same
1:34:12
over here when the devil's lying with a voice of condemnation and he's the same over here over here when you make a
1:34:20
mistake because you are growing and you're not completely perfected yet you're growing he is the same there is
1:34:27
no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus so he's saying I love you
1:34:32
this way is better come this way my son my daughter repent come this way this
1:34:38
way is better i'm on your side and I want you to win come this way don't go
1:34:43
the devil's way this way is better this is the only way come here i'm cheering
1:34:48
you on come here come this way you can do it you can reject the devil's lies
1:34:53
you can close the door you don't have to give into the enemy's temptation you can go this
1:35:00
way you can follow me you can resist him you can do it
1:35:06
that's God not what you going to do do you really love me
1:35:15
that's not God he's for The Bible says he's for you not against you the Bible
1:35:20
says there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus the Bible says that he endured
1:35:26
every temptation that we endure as he came fully man fully God and fully man
1:35:32
so that means he understands it means he understands you're in a spiritual war it means he he understands he was in the
1:35:38
garden of Gethsemane and he even uttered the words "Take this cup from me Lord."
1:35:43
When he knew that wasn't the father's will he prayed what wasn't the father's will
1:35:49
but he followed it up with saying "But not my will your will." So that means he
1:35:55
felt the weakness of the flesh that means he felt the temptation of the enemy it means he knows that we are in a
1:36:02
spiritual war and he understands you he understands
1:36:09
So that's why he's cheering you on in the middle of temptation if you make a mistake he's cheering you
1:36:18
on hallelujah he's the same god is the same he doesn't change based on your
1:36:26
feelings but your feelings say that he changes
1:36:32
have you ever noticed when you are in the best mood of your life God seems so much
1:36:37
greater god seems so much more proud of you have you ever felt that i
1:36:45
have and then have you ever felt that maybe someday it's just maybe you're in a season of waiting and it's a season
1:36:52
where you haven't it's not as much like tremendous blessings and open door and reward season it's testing season and
1:37:00
then the enemy attacks and then it's like it's a it's a
1:37:05
valley and anybody ever feel like God is not as proud of you in those
1:37:12
days but he's the same he's the same he's just as proud
1:37:19
and when you're choosing obedience he's he's even more proud because you're doing something that's more
1:37:27
difficult to please him to serve him you're doing something more difficult that blesses his heart even more there
1:37:33
there's levels we can touch God's heart he never changes
1:37:39
hallelujah praise
1:37:47
God god is always victorious
1:37:53
he is undefeated there's never been a battle that he has
1:38:00
lost never that is our all powerful mighty
1:38:08
God for all of eternity for thousands of years he has won every
1:38:16
battle every single one and when you are a child of God do
1:38:22
you know that every battle that comes in your life belongs to God
1:38:28
[Applause] we are part of God's army and we are vessels that he uses to fight the good
1:38:35
fight of faith but he's the one really fighting the battle we are resting we
1:38:41
are being obedient and he's the one with the guns the power the weapons
1:38:51
he's the stone in the slingshot that supernaturally moves with power to
1:38:59
hit the head of Goliath
1:39:05
hallelujah hallelujah he is always
1:39:10
victorious yes so whether you are feeling the victory whether you are seeing the
1:39:18
vindication or whether it looks like there are more against you whether it
1:39:25
looks like the devil's winning but it's a lie but it looks that way in the spirit in the physical realm just like the servant of
1:39:33
Elijah thought there was more against them in both circumstances God will have the
1:39:41
victory in both circumstances there are more for us than against us
1:39:48
so whether you feel you feel like you're winning or you don't feel like you're
1:39:54
winning you're winning god's winning god's winning
1:40:00
every single time so the enemy comes and brings an attack
1:40:06
like you've never seen you've never seen a Goliath you've seen you've seen enemies half the size of Goliath you've
1:40:15
seen the enemy come with schemes half the size of Goliath but you never seen a Goliath before but now there's a Goliath
1:40:22
you should have the same attitude as you did before that same attitude of victory overwhelming victory the battle belongs
1:40:29
to God i will rest in the Lord as he defeats my enemies the devil's under my
1:40:35
feet you should have that same attitude you see Goliath the same confidence you should
1:40:40
have the same exact confidence because why god never changes god is always
1:40:48
victorious every day he always has been and he always will be
1:40:56
2 Kings 6:15 when the servant of the man of God got up early the next morning and went outside there were troops horses
1:41:01
and chariots everywhere oh sir what will we do now the young man cried to Elisha
1:41:08
don't be afraid Elisha told him for there are more on our side than on theirs then Elisha prayed "Oh Lord open
1:41:15
his eyes and let him see." The Lord opened the young man's eyes and when he looked up he saw that the hillside around Elisha was filled with horses and
1:41:23
chariots of fire so this is this is the same this is the
1:41:29
same this is the same thing again that we see on on the palm when they're
1:41:35
waving the palms you know in the physical realm it looks like they have the
1:41:40
victory and then the then Jesus goes to the cross and all of the disciples their
1:41:46
eyes weren't open they were like well all of them but the three all of them were like uh Elisha's servant before his
1:41:54
eyes were opened up the Pharisees are winning the
1:42:00
Pharisees are arrested Jesus the Pharisees brought Jesus on the cross we
1:42:05
are defeated jesus is defeated that's the feelings they were having they were
1:42:10
seen in the physical not the spirit it's the same exact story as
1:42:16
Elisha i mean it's the same
1:42:21
principle there are angel armies fighting for you fighting for
1:42:28
us through every single battle not just some battles every single battle there
1:42:35
is an angel army god is never
1:42:41
sleeping god is constantly fighting every single battle there's battles
1:42:46
happening you don't even know about you're sleeping and the devil's scheming the devil's sending people agents of him
1:42:54
to scheme and plot against you you don't even know it's happening but God sees it
1:42:59
and God's on it and he's he's sending out his angel
1:43:04
armies commissioning them go and fight for my son go fight for my
1:43:11
daughter slice those demons destroy the works of the devil
1:43:17
hallelujah he's the same he's the same he's always fighting for us he's always
1:43:25
victorious hallelujah hallelujah
1:43:33
hallelujah that's why go That's why God says "Why would you ever fear?" There's
1:43:38
never a reason to ever fear because God is never sleeping while the devil's
1:43:44
coming after you god is never sleeping god sees it before the devil starts to
1:43:51
try and he stops the devil every time
1:43:57
and if you see the weapon forming against you it's just that God allowed you to see it so that he can use it as a
1:44:04
refining fire for you as a test for you but it's never a sign that God is
1:44:11
sleeping that God isn't aware of the battle or that maybe you aren't worthy for God to fight for you never god will
1:44:19
always defeat every battle of the devil against you always
1:44:25
hallelujah [Applause]
1:44:35
hallelujah all right now so now
1:44:42
also God is always wanting to wanting to destroy the works of the devil in your
1:44:49
life always every time Jesus ministered every time if you read through the gospels
1:44:56
please do please read through all the gospels this is very important read through all the gospels when you do you
1:45:03
will find Jesus constantly ministering when he's ministering he's preaching but he's also always casting out demons and
1:45:10
healing the sick and he's never turning anyone away and the Bible consistently
1:45:15
records that he's healing everybody only those who who don't believe don't receive but if people believe if people
1:45:22
really are coming to him with faith with just an open heart to receive like a
1:45:27
child they receive we never find a time where God says
1:45:32
"Nope I'm not going to heal you." The Bible is so simple in this way
1:45:39
i mean the the I mean it the ways of God the ways of God of bringing healing and
1:45:44
freedom is very simple according to the Bible according to the Bible we see the
1:45:49
the healing manifest in different ways we see the healing come in different ways we see God Jesus give prophetic
1:45:57
directions uh and and and h how to receive the healing how to receive the freedom one
1:46:03
time he says to the lepers "Show yourselves to the priests give an offering to the priests on your way you
1:46:09
will be healed." So they were healed on their way so it was different how the healing was
1:46:14
coming sometime he spit on somebody's eyes sometimes he spit in in the dirt
1:46:20
made mud put it on the person's eyes and that's how he brought healing to the blind eyes
1:46:27
sometimes God wanted this the sickness to God allowed the sickness to go to
1:46:32
death in Lazarus because God wanted to do a different miracle of resurrection to
1:46:39
reveal more of his glory that he doesn't just heal but he even resurrects he
1:46:44
brings the dead to life so the healing the he the the the
1:46:52
destroying of the works of the devil comes in different ways comes in different timings but how the Bible
1:46:58
records the ministry of Jesus is very simple all who come to him were healed and freed all who had demons the demons
1:47:05
had to go he cast them out any kind of sickness Jesus healed them
1:47:12
now how many of you believe that Jesus is the same yesterday today forever
1:47:17
good because that's the what the word of God says and how many of you have chosen
1:47:23
to believe in the word of God today instead of mainstream
1:47:29
Christianity tradition Christianity today
1:47:35
hallelujah good because you should because we are called to believe in the
1:47:40
word the our doctrine as believers is supposed to be based on the word not
1:47:46
what we see not what we see today not based on culture not based on tradition
1:47:52
not based on religious rituals not based on somebody's word for it not based on what is the most common popular way of
1:47:59
being a Christian of doing church miracles all of that amen hallelujah so
1:48:06
the Bible puts it very simply that Jesus had that the devil came to steal kill
1:48:11
and destroy but Jesus has come so that we would have abundant life the de the Bible puts it very simply jesus Jes the
1:48:17
son of man Jesus was sent to destroy the works of the
1:48:25
devil and the devil is at work in many people's lives demonic oppression
1:48:31
sicknesses are works of the devil and very simply Jesus wants to free and heal
1:48:38
every person who will come to him who has demonic oppression or sickness very
1:48:44
simple amen hallelujah it's as simple as that praise God so God
1:48:54
has not changed every day whoever needs healing or freedom God wants to bring
1:48:59
healing and freedom to you to them i expect miracles to happen every single
1:49:07
Sunday every single service I minister every single conference i expect so many
1:49:12
miracles to take place because I know there are so many people in need just as in the times of Jesus he was healing and delivering
1:49:19
people every time because there was a constant need the devil was busy at work there was a constant need of God's power
1:49:25
to bring healing and freedom and so I am expecting every and and this is what I've seen ever since God started to
1:49:32
unleash the anointing through this ministry of 5F church in 2021 ever since
1:49:38
then I have been expectant to see God cast out demons heal the sick release
1:49:44
his anointing baptize people in the Holy Spirit every single time I minister I've been expectant for that one of the big
1:49:52
reasons I'm expectant of that is because this is who God is this is God's heart this is what he wants to do he's never
1:49:58
changed this is the Jesus that we read about in the Bible this is who was here today this is the same
1:50:05
Jesus and so because he was doing that continually in the Gospels he's wanting to do that continually today so if we
1:50:12
will adhere to his word accept his ways stand with him in this simple way God
1:50:18
wants to heal and deliver anybody who needs it today if we will simply do that and be vessels of him and put aside
1:50:27
our agenda and put aside our sermons and put aside our entertainment and put aside being comfortable and not having
1:50:34
persecution if we will put aside all of that and allow the Holy Spirit to lead
1:50:40
he will then show up and simply heal anybody who needs healing and free anybody who needs freedom
1:50:48
very simple the kingdom of God God's ways are very simple religion is what
1:50:54
has made it complicated but Jesus how to receive from Jesus Jesus's ways are very
1:51:01
simple hallelujah because that is love love is simple love isn't complicated
1:51:10
love is very simple love saves loves heals love delivers love
1:51:18
protects love perseveres love is kind love is gentle this is love very simple the devil is at
1:51:26
work in people's lives people need freedom people need healing people need their eyes to open up to God's love so
1:51:33
God releases his power to do all of that to heal to deliver to open up eyes to
1:51:38
his love very simple hallelujah that is our Jesus that's how good our God
1:51:45
is when you seek him you will find him but you don't it's he doesn't make it complicated to seek
1:51:50
him you just have to seek him the right way which was is with a humble pure
1:51:56
heart amen
1:52:02
hallelujah god's main way of healing and delivering is by putting his anointing
1:52:09
his power that destroys every yoke in his servants that's his main way of healing
1:52:16
and delivering that's his principle god can do miracles
1:52:22
in other ways sometimes you can cry out to him people have cried out to him in their rooms or wherever and a miracle
1:52:29
takes place a healing a freedom deliverance it takes place a demon it goes that has happened that's probably
1:52:37
happened in several of your lives however probably those types of miracles
1:52:43
are more rare in your life than receiving
1:52:49
miracles god's main way of releasing
1:52:58
miracles by that I mean maybe someone has cried out for a miracle and God did
1:53:04
a miracle just there without a vessel but if it's not you know the next day they need a miracle or the next week
1:53:10
they need a miracle and they cry out and they don't see it they don't see the healing happen they don't see the freedom happening and they wonder why
1:53:18
it's because God has a principle a main way of bringing healing and freedom of
1:53:23
releasing miracles and that's by using his vessels in the church in the house of
1:53:29
God it can be through the screen that's the church in the house of God as well if you can't be here in person because you live far away but not if you don't
1:53:36
live far away you have to come in person that's what God wants do not neglect the gathering of
1:53:42
believers it says in the word so this is simply the biblical way
1:53:48
that we see we see it demonstrated first through Jesus jesus demonstrated how to do ministry and so whenever he was
1:53:54
ministering when people would come to him he would heal them and deliver them we would see but what what what we
1:54:00
didn't see is we didn't see people in their rooms in their houses saying "Man
1:54:05
I have a demon and I hear this Jesus can heal and deliver and people are saying he is Lord and so I accept him as Lord
1:54:12
and now I ask Jesus that you will come spiritually into my room and cast this
1:54:17
demon out of me." We don't see any example of somebody being freed that way in the Bible we see people coming coming
1:54:26
and touching the hem of his garment positioning themselves where physically where he's releasing
1:54:33
anointing and today that can be extended online as well but that's a symbol of coming to church whenever he was
1:54:40
ministering it was specifically where he was ministering he would preach the gospel and cast out demons he was
1:54:46
modeling church to us most of the times that Jesus was casting
1:54:51
out demons it was when he was ministering when he was preaching the gospel it when he was having
1:54:59
church that was most of the times that we see him cast out demons not all the times but most of the times
1:55:05
amen and so he was modeling to us he was demonstrating to us how to do church and how to see many
1:55:14
be healed and delivered now we see Apostle Peter doing what Jesus told him
1:55:19
he would do you do the things I do and greater you will do the same exact things I do and greater preach the
1:55:24
gospel heal the sick cast out demons raise the dead acts 5:15 as a result of the
1:55:30
apostles work Peter As a result of the apostles work sick people were brought out into the streets on beds and mats so
1:55:37
that Peter's shadow might fall across some of them as he went by crowds came
1:55:42
from the villages around Jerusalem bringing their sick and those possessed by evil spirits and they were all healed
1:55:54
so here we see that they were positioning themselves who were sick and
1:55:59
oppressed where Apostle Peter was ministering apostle Peter carried highlevel anointing that could cast out
1:56:07
even highlevel demonic spirits and so that's a big reason why all were healed
1:56:14
and not just some is because he had the anointing that could deal with even the
1:56:20
highlevel demonic cases because he was a leader in the body of Christ he was an
1:56:25
apostle and God puts the highest level anointing in the leaders because they are the ones that are supposed to
1:56:31
release to others they are the ones that are supposed to equip equip others to also then walk in the power of God and
1:56:37
be powerful vessels of God they are the ones that are supposed to impart the anointing so they have to have higher
1:56:43
levels like how a teacher has to have higher levels of knowledge that's why you go to school you want the teacher to
1:56:49
have higher levels of knowledge you want the doctor to have higher levels of knowledge than you that's why you come to him right or her so that's why God
1:56:58
puts the highest levels always in the leadership that in the anointed servants of God he anoints and so that's why we
1:57:07
see the most we in the book of Acts you see the believers were in awe of the
1:57:12
signs and wonders performed by the apostles there's a specific scripture we see
1:57:18
where they're in awe and it's specifically of the signs and wonders performed by the apostles is because
1:57:24
they were seeing the greatest kinds of signs and wonders and miracles happen in the church in the times of
1:57:30
ministry in this just like we see with Apostle Peter
1:57:37
hallelujah so so now we're going to go to Acts
1:57:44
28:3 as Paul gathered an armful of sticks context we are at we're Paul is
1:57:50
in Malta the island of Malta he's on an island and it's cold so they're making a fire paul gathered an armful of sticks
1:57:57
and was laying them on the fire a poisonous snake driven out by the
1:58:10
heat hallelujah one second driven out by the heat bit him on the hand a poisonous
1:58:16
snake driven out by the heat bit him on the hand the people on the island saw it
1:58:21
hanging from his hand and said to each other "A murderer no doubt though he escaped the sea justice will not permit
1:58:28
him to live." But Paul shook off the snake into the fire and was
1:58:35
unharmed the people waited for him to swell up or suddenly drop dead but when
1:58:40
they had waited a long time and saw that he wasn't harmed they changed their minds and decided he was a god because
1:58:47
these people didn't hear the gospel yet these people um believed in goddesses and all that near the shore where we
1:58:53
landed was an estate belonging to Pubilis the chief official of the island he welcomed us and treated us kindly for
1:59:00
three days as it happened Pubilis's father was ill with fever and disentry
1:59:05
paul went in and prayed for him and laying his hands on him he healed him now at this point we can presume that
1:59:11
Paul would have told them "This is Jesus's power he would have clarified he's not a god." But not every little
1:59:16
detail is written in the in the scripture you know but we can presume that he indeed told them this is Jesus
1:59:22
so that they then were believing in Jesus and that he was anointed by Jesus paul went in and prayed for him and
1:59:27
laying his hands on him he healed him then all the other sick people on the island came and were healed
1:59:36
hallelujah now notice how it says all like s very
1:59:44
simple pubilis's father was ill with fever and dentury so he's sick paul
1:59:50
comes he releases the anointing jesus heals him simple okay so now people see
1:59:57
wow the power of God is moving through Paul okay we need to we need to bring
2:00:03
all the sick to him for Jesus to move through him and heal him and very do you see how simple this is
2:00:11
they were all healed oh I do do do you see do you see how
2:00:17
simple it is in the Bible has God changed
2:00:23
does he still want to heal like he wanted to heal back then yes
2:00:29
look how simple God is look at how amazing his love very simple this is not complicated
2:00:36
hallelujah all were healed so do you see how this is very similar to the example
2:00:41
of Apostle Peter that I gave Peter and Paul Paul Act Acts 19:11
2:00:46
says that that God gave God was doing extraordinary unusual miracles through
2:00:52
the hands of Paul it says that in Acts 19:11 so here's that other another
2:00:57
example he was also an apostle a leader in the body of Christ and God put a an
2:01:04
extraordinary level of anointing in him and so even the highest demonic cases
2:01:09
demonic infirmities they had to go when he walked in his authority and released
2:01:15
the the high level anointing God gave him amen so this is God's way God's main
2:01:22
way of healing and delivering hallelujah
2:01:27
so um what is important to understand is
2:01:35
that God always wants to show up and bring healing and freedom and miracles
2:01:42
always always and you you will see this take
2:01:49
place when you do things the Bible's way God's way
2:01:57
when if we can accept God's ways if we can accept God's servants if we can
2:02:02
accept his ways of releasing healing and freedom through vessels that he anoints
2:02:08
if we can accept apostles prophets in addition to evangelists pastors and teachers if we
2:02:16
can accept this is how God releases healing and freedom i'm going to position myself under the shadow or I'm
2:02:22
going to come to receive healing like I they came to Paul i'm going to come to God moving through Peter i'm going to
2:02:28
come to God moving through Paul of today peter Paul of today and this is what it
2:02:34
should be like in every church we're getting there we're not there yet we're in the beginning of this revival so it's
2:02:39
not like there's only a couple churches where there's a Peter and a Paul there should be many many many many Peters of
2:02:45
today and Paul's of today in the world in the body of Christ
2:02:50
and we are getting there this is just the beginning we are laying the foundation hallelujah just like there
2:02:56
was 12 apostles and it grew from there amen um but what's so important for you
2:03:03
to know is that God is constantly wanting to heal and
2:03:10
deliver and release miracles and release more of his spirit at his true church through his
2:03:17
true anointed servants through his Peter and Paul's of today
2:03:25
hallelujah hallelujah so you know Paul
2:03:30
carried that anointing and and the thing about anointing is this when God really puts anointing and authority in
2:03:37
you it is there to heal and deliver period very simple
2:03:44
like it is simple it's not a matter of does God want to do will God do this does God want to do this and ever since
2:03:52
ever since the Lord revealed this revelation to me and I really saw but glory to God that I carry anointing and
2:03:59
authority over demons over sicknesses now when I pray for people every time I
2:04:06
know God has done something just because of his principle just
2:04:11
simply because of his principle and his ways because of this biblical way that I'm sharing with you right now that's
2:04:16
why not oh I saw they were healed and the spirits like I just
2:04:22
know i know this principle of God i know
2:04:28
God has never changed i know that just as the people brought the sick to Peter
2:04:33
brought the sick and oppressed to Paul all were healed very simple that's the
2:04:38
same thing God is doing today when his anointing is truly present but remember that Jesus couldn't heal
2:04:46
people because of lack of faith in his hometown so how it is in the spiritual realm like when I pray for people I know
2:04:53
that for sure anointing is released it it just just like when you hear my word
2:04:59
anointing is also coming out with the word [Applause]
2:05:06
like when you hear the word you for sure hear the word well for sure the anointing is released
2:05:12
with the word for sure the demon has to obey the authority with the word
2:05:18
[Applause] if I told you all right now everybody stand don't do it if I told you all right now everybody stand up you stand
2:05:24
up simple if I told all of you right now raise your hand you would raise your hand
2:05:30
if I tell a demon to go it has to go because it's real authority it's real
2:05:38
authority that works that the demons have to obey
2:05:43
and so simply that spiritual knowledge that I'm teaching you the simple way of God that we see in the word very simply
2:05:50
that's why I know every time I pray the anointing is released miracles have been
2:05:56
released now it's up to the person to receive it
2:06:02
and I see it that way i see it's like it's like it's almost like I like God through me for example is releasing like
2:06:10
a a present for you and a present for you and a present there's hundreds of people here so it's like if I were to be
2:06:16
like present present for Diane present for Jung present for Pastor Heather
2:06:22
present present for Kathy present for Lucy present for Shane present for Steve
2:06:29
present for Weston with your name on it here like it's dropped all filling the stage so they're
2:06:37
all there god has for sure released gifts god has for sure released miracles every Sunday
2:06:43
every Sunday maybe you don't need healing or freedom but God has something a word that will change your life more
2:06:50
of his spirit more of his fire more of his impartation that will change you but it's all really like it's here on the
2:06:57
stage but then it's up to you to come and collect it
2:07:03
to actually grab that present and treasure it and hang on to it and
2:07:09
protect it and take it outside the doors with you and still treasure it and protect it and when the devil tries to
2:07:16
steal it you still treasure it and protect it you remember that God indeed gave you that gift on that stage and
2:07:22
it's for sure yours that is reality hallelujah
2:07:28
hallelujah yeah so that's how it is i'm not like when I see someone with a dire
2:07:35
illness or infirmity I'm like "Oh I'm not like,"Oh God I hope you do this." I
2:07:40
know he has released his anointing i I just know it i know he has moved i know
2:07:45
he has touched this person because of the Bible because of this
2:07:52
revelation of his ways that I'm just teaching you right now amen hallelujah hallelujah
2:08:00
so so um praise God
2:08:05
so this is what is this is what will be life-changing for you to be able to
2:08:11
receive every time and never miss out is to have this understanding that God
2:08:17
never changes that God is truly releasing his power miracles to you
2:08:24
every single time every single time he's going to show up he's going to show up
2:08:30
and God is faithful to his word he never
2:08:37
lies his promises are yes and [Music]
2:08:43
amen always and so when now we just need to believe his word now we need to
2:08:49
believe his word that comes through his prophets through his servants that's it and then we can believe them and
2:08:56
receive them because without faith this is where you
2:09:02
don't receive miracles simply have faith and you can receive
2:09:10
so when God speaks I'm going to move i'm going to move like never before and
2:09:16
arise and shine i'm going to release miracles that you
2:09:22
need i'm going to release more of my spirit more of my fire more impartation
2:09:28
i am going to open up your spiritual eyes like never before i am going to
2:09:34
transform your life forever with how I reveal my glory i am going to
2:09:41
do wonders and reveal my glory like the splitting of the Red Sea in the spiritual
2:09:46
realm i am going to do this it is going to be like the day of Pentecost when God
2:09:52
speaks this word through a servant but it's God's word when he speaks it you
2:09:58
need to simply believe it and receive it you need to believe that what he has said
2:10:04
yesterday came to pass and what he has said today will come to pass too
2:10:10
what he spoke through his prophets through his apostles through his servants in the word of God in the past
2:10:17
came to pass and these words of God he's speaking today through his servants
2:10:23
through his prophets through his apostles will come to pass
2:10:29
so believe it receive it and have faith
2:10:34
and you will receive you can be receiving so powerfully every
2:10:40
week you don't need to every time you do not need to wait on your feelings do not
2:10:46
wait on your feelings amen and you know Paul at first they were
2:10:55
saying the devil's really working in his life working through him he's he's he's
2:11:02
being punished because it says something like this when they remember when they thought he was going to die because of
2:11:08
the snake uh uh going onto his hand biting him a murderer no doubt though he
2:11:16
escaped the sea justice will not permit him to live so they were looking at him
2:11:22
with wrong perspective and if they kept that perspective they wouldn't have received
2:11:29
miracles of God through him would they have but then they saw him rightly and then
2:11:37
they came to Jesus through him and they were able to receive healing and
2:11:44
miracles hallelujah so there will be seasons in
2:11:49
life where it's easier to believe than others but God wants to release his
2:11:56
miracles to you in the easy times and in the difficult times every time he wants
2:12:02
to release more of his spirit to you so don't miss out on coming to church
2:12:09
always on coming to receive the church will be persecuted i will be persecuted
2:12:14
you will be persecuted we will all be persecuted for our faith and it will come in different seasons and so in
2:12:21
those times it's not as easy to see the right perspective it is
2:12:27
not as easy to praise God and to come to the church and receive but God wants you
2:12:33
to receive in those times too god wants you to receive miracles and more of his spirit and peace and joy in those times
2:12:42
too amen you have to renew your mind and see in the spirit
2:12:49
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God
2:12:56
and so some of from now I see that so many of you are ch are going to be changed from today i see this word was
2:13:04
needed for to receive to for what God has for you at the arise and shine conference because it the reason why
2:13:12
they received so powerfully on the day of Pentecost was number one because God had ordained this as a divine
2:13:18
appointment he had scheduled this day for his spirit his fire to come
2:13:24
powerfully on the people number one but number two the people had faith the
2:13:31
people came with expectancy the people believed God is going to do what he said
2:13:37
he was going to do he's not a liar he said to wait for his spirit he said
2:13:43
to be in one accord he said to be expectant and he's going to show up
2:13:49
and just coming with that simplicity coming with that simple faith
2:13:57
the combination of that and God's what God had already planned is what made the
2:14:02
Pentecost to happen the day of Pentecost to happen the fire of the Holy Spirit to come that's the two
2:14:09
ingredients that's it so your part you have a part to play in receiving you
2:14:14
have a part to play in receiving every time you have a part to play for a rise and shine conference for what God has in
2:14:20
store to release to you but your part is very simple your part is to choose
2:14:28
faith don't look at your feelings choose faith this kind of faith god wants to release something
2:14:37
lifechanging to me whatever you need God wants to deliver
2:14:43
me and he's going to deliver me god wants to heal me and he's going to heal me
2:14:49
god wants to release more of his spirit god wants to release more of his fire god wants to release impartation god
2:14:55
wants to open up my spiritual eyes more he said he's going to do it he said it through his servant he does not lie he's
2:15:02
going to do it i believe and maybe it doesn't matter if you feel it or not you choose to believe
2:15:12
and you proclaim it you speak it aloud i believe you're going to do this God i believe you're going to show up i
2:15:18
believe you're going to release to me what you said you're going to release to me i believe i believe and I receive i
2:15:26
receive i praise you Jesus and I receive i'm expecting Jesus it doesn't matter
2:15:31
what you feel maybe the enemy is so angry at what's going to happen he might try to send an attack it doesn't matter
2:15:40
what you feel if you feel oh what's happening forget those feelings i believe I I'm gonna
2:15:48
receive i'm gonna receive and we need to understand that
2:15:53
is it isn't it is inevitable that the devil is going to try to keep us from
2:15:58
receiving but he is a loser always he's under our feet you need to understand it's inevitable that the enemy will try
2:16:06
to stop you from receiving from God he will try to stop you from walking in your calling he's going to try to stop
2:16:12
you from what God has ordained you to do he's going to try to stop we need to know that that will be inevitable
2:16:20
but we need to we need to not we need to choose to not be disturbed and have fear
2:16:25
of that reality we need to be okay with that reality and
2:16:31
remember that the devil will always be under our feet
2:16:37
always always always we will always have victory i have an amazing story that um
2:16:46
a lot of you have seen that I posted last night um God has been showing up in signs lately he's been proving himself
2:16:53
in signs he's been encouraging me us with signs lately
2:16:59
hallelujah and so for 40 days I have seen the enemy the the you know new
2:17:06
levels new devils is real and this year of the of God's year of
2:17:11
acceptance is a new level and I've seen God take me to a new level in ministry a
2:17:17
new level to preach the gospel in different different doors new doors he's opened that he's never opened before and
2:17:23
as soon as that came came new devils and the way new de new devils look like is literally like an evil kind of devil
2:17:31
like I've seen a greater kind of evil I never saw before trying to stop me
2:17:38
trying to stop what God wants to do through me and through us f5f I I've
2:17:43
seen it i've seen those weapons form but they have not prospered [Music]
2:17:48
hallelujah but I've se I've seen the weapons form and not prosper i've seen them form i've seen them form several of
2:17:55
them and um just one day after this
2:18:00
great news of finding out about the book on the bestseller list on the USA Today
2:18:05
and the 26 and that night I I saw the Lord spoke to me through the Psalm 26 i
2:18:11
was going on a jog and you know I even like saw a weapon formed against me that
2:18:17
day um but I had so much joy and peace it didn't shake me at all i had so much joy and peace remembering what God did
2:18:24
yesterday remembering how the devil's under my feet reme remembering Psalms 26
2:18:30
and so hallelujah I was so full of joy and I was jogging on my on my on my on
2:18:36
my hike on the trail and I was praising God as I was as
2:18:42
jogging in my headphones i had praise music going and I was singing out loud as I was jogging and I was running down
2:18:49
the mountain and I'm looking ahead of me i'm not looking down i'm looking far ahead
2:18:56
and I'm praising God to the most jolly praise song I've ever heard it It goes
2:19:01
something like this oh my goodness he's a good good God oh my
2:19:08
goodness it's like It's almost silly it's just so jolly i love it so I'm like
2:19:13
"Oh my goodness he's a good good God oh my goodness." Like I'm literally like
2:19:20
smiling and singing out loud and I'm literally jogging i was going faster i was going down the hill gravity's
2:19:26
pulling me oh my goodness he's a good good God
2:19:33
what and I trampled on what I what seemed like a
2:19:38
snake i was jogging like that oh my goodness
2:19:44
and it was like as like literally like I you it was so supernatural because usually you would see something like in
2:19:50
the peripheral you know and it would like cause you to look and then like slow down something on the trail but I
2:19:56
my eyes were so far ahead and I was like so focused on praising God that like I
2:20:02
didn't realize I trampled on something until it happened and like as it
2:20:07
happened I saw in my peripheral like something dark and I knew I trampled right on top of something and I knew it
2:20:12
was an animal and then I looked behind me and it slithered moved crawled I don't know really quickly away and I
2:20:19
couldn't tell make out what it was but all of a sudden I saw We have a video i saw what looked like what looked like a
2:20:26
snake's tail we have a video we're going to play it you can play it if you find
2:20:32
it but this tail was going crazy it was just a tail it was just a tail it wasn't
2:20:38
It It was There we go i took a video of it this is just a tail
2:20:44
and I didn't know what kind of animal it was but I was assuming it was a snake it looked like a snake's tail but regardless the Lord spoke to me
2:20:51
spiritually in this moment the moment that I trampled and I looked behind me
2:20:56
and I saw like the exact moment this scripture came right in my mind
2:21:02
boom i will give you all power over the enemy you will trample on serpents and
2:21:11
scorpions and you will overcome them and nothing will harm
2:21:18
you no power will harm you hallelujah
2:21:24
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah luke 10:19 that
2:21:32
scripture came to me in that moment and I have never uh uh Lily was a witness
2:21:38
she was here she was a witness come here testify
2:21:44
and I I just go I've never reacted that way and I actually have on video but I'm like "Oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my god oh
2:21:52
my god." And I just could not believe what Jesus had done because I knew it was Jesus
2:21:58
yes i just thought it was so precious cuz she's just like running and she is singing and she's so joyful and I was
2:22:05
thinking "Oh gosh she has such a pure heart and she's so precious and all of a sudden she just stops." And then she
2:22:11
knew she stepped on something and as soon as I seen that shaking that's the exact same scripture that came to my
2:22:18
mind and I was so thankful for what God is going to do because I know we have
2:22:24
victory hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah
2:22:33
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
2:22:38
hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah
2:22:44
hallelujah hallelujah and the Lord began speaking to me the Lord began speaking to me you
2:22:52
know I was wearing a sneaker i was wearing a sneaker and it was just one trample and I knew the Lord did this
2:22:58
supernaturally like to show this prophetic sign to me to us uh this that
2:23:04
this is how it is in the spiritual realm and I and God was so good for this to happen on a day that I was full of so
2:23:11
much like so much joy and praising him because it showed me this is so powerful
2:23:19
it's inevitable that there's going to be snakes on the trail of
2:23:25
life as you walk forward praising God and proclaiming his goodness he's a good
2:23:32
good God who heals and delivers it's inevitable that there are snakes
2:23:37
spiritual snakes devil demons people working through God work the devil
2:23:43
working through people and they're in the bushes and it's inevitable that they are
2:23:50
scheming to come and try to bite you to come and try to stop you and disturb you
2:23:57
this is inevitable we know this but we should never be afraid to go on the hike
2:24:06
we should never we should never let that
2:24:12
reality take our joy and praise and focus on the Lord
2:24:19
and when I when I trampled on it it was with ease this happened with ease i
2:24:25
didn't have to do two times three times i didn't have to go Wow i was just
2:24:34
jogging you know i was getting exercise i was praising God and I killed the
2:24:41
demon with with one stone with one trample you know you don't have to take
2:24:48
your focus off of praising God and serving God to trample it'll s It'll just happen automatically
2:24:56
it'll just happen automatically and you can keep praising God and I was even praising God even more so what the enemy
2:25:03
intended for harm God intended for good look at my God look at the authority and
2:25:08
victory he's given me he's given us woo
2:25:14
hallelujah this is truly a prophetic sign that God has given us and he wants
2:25:20
you to have more confidence and and joy than ever before
2:25:27
you know the snakes may increase but you just keep on trampling on them every single time
2:25:34
so whether whether it's lesser snakes or more snakes trying to come and bite you
2:25:41
you will trample on them either way so in times of spiritual
2:25:48
war have the same joy have more joy amen praise God praise him more serve
2:25:56

give to God right now we're going to give the Bible says in Malachi 3:10
2:30:44
"Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse bring the whole
2:30:51
tithe." That means today that means the church bring the whole tithe into the
2:30:59
church that there may be food in the house that there may that there may be
2:31:04
provision in the church that there may be provision for the work of God that there may be provision for the
2:31:11
conference for arise and shine test me in this says the Lord and see if I will
2:31:16
not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it i
2:31:22
will prevent pests from devouring your crops and the vines in your fields will not drop their fruit before it's ripe says the Lord Almighty then all the
2:31:29
nations will call you blessed for yours will be a delightful land says the Lord
2:31:36
Almighty so God says that when you bring the tithe into the church when you
2:31:41
because there's this is how God brings provision for the work of God is through
2:31:47
you is through his children amen so when you do this test me in this
2:31:54
God says and he says he's going to bring pour out so many so much blessing there's not room for it and he will also
2:32:01
protect your finances he'll prevent pests from dividing your crops and vines and yields will not drop the fruit
2:32:06
before it ripes he will protect your finances as you give to the work of God
2:32:13
then all the nations will call you blessed for yours will be a delightful land all the nations will call you
2:32:19
blessed for yours will be a delightful land see giving is powerful this is this
2:32:26
this shows us the power of sewing and reaping people will see you as blessed
2:32:31
people will see abundant life in every area come into your life because you
2:32:36
have surrendered your life to God which includes being obedient to give to the
2:32:42
work of God to sew into the work of God i want to encourage you to see yourself
2:32:48
as uh uh an important an important part of this work
2:32:56
with your contributions with your seeds because we cannot be at this a place
2:33:01
like the Oreium Theater and have church that Sunday three days of ministry and
2:33:07
all the costs that go into that to have these massive venues and everything that goes into that we can't do that without
2:33:13
you without you and you and you without you bringing the seed into the storehouse
2:33:21
the food into the storehouse so that there's enough amen
2:33:26
hallelujah so may you give cheerfully today may you give sacrificially today
2:33:32
and I want to encourage any of you i know there's so many people that have to make a sacrifice financially that the
2:33:37
state that they are in financially to get to this conference they are in a
2:33:42
wilderness season right now where they do they they just have just enough to
2:33:47
get a plane ticket to come here and this sacrifice God sees as beautiful and it
2:33:54
the sacrifice even is causing there to be a greater releasing upon because
2:33:59
there's a cost to receiving more from God and many times the cost is financial
2:34:05
not always but sometimes that's that's the cost that it is amen as I shared
2:34:11
with for me when I went to Tanzania my spiritual father's church in Tanzania East Africa that was a great financial
2:34:16
cost every time to get the flight tickets to go out there but I received like never before in my life
2:34:23
spiritually which translated to physically every time I went there the
2:34:28
the times I received the most was when I brought a sacrif when a sacrifice was
2:34:33
made so um I want to encourage all of you to make a sacrifice for some of you
2:34:39
you just have enough money to get the plane ticket here that is your sacrifice i want to encourage all of you to make a
2:34:45
sacrifice for this conference to receive more amen
2:34:51
because God wants you to make a sacrifice number one but number two there's a need so God's asking you to
2:34:57
because there's a need like how he does in this verse bring the tithe into the storehouse so there's enough bring the so that there's enough food but also he
2:35:05
wants you to receive more and this is his principle to make a sacrifice so have that in your heart
2:35:11
lord what I'm about to receive is not cheap it's of great value and so I want
2:35:16
to honor you in this way i want to honor your work and bring my sacrifice let it be not just the people flying and
2:35:23
traveling making a sacrifice i want to make a sacrifice to you God cuz you're worthy and I don't want this to be
2:35:30
cheap i don't want to to treat this as cheap what you're going to release i
2:35:35
want to give honor to you amen hallelujah so if you like to give you
2:35:41

2:35:46
online lift your seat up right now so I can release the anointing upon you
2:35:52
i speak to every person giving that there would be increase in your life that there would be increase financially
2:35:58

2:55:05
we've seen so much improvement we we went to revival is now Rotterdam and um
2:55:10
at that time he had several seizures every day and they stopped for one week
2:55:16
one wall week and they came back and at that time I I didn't know about how to
2:55:22
maintain our deliverance so um you prayed for me on a zoom call and you you
2:55:28
said to me he is delivered and you have to reject the lies so um when he was
2:55:35
having a seizure I had to uh to say uh he is healed he's delivered and um I I
2:55:42
reject this that lie and as I was doing that I gained so much strength and
2:55:50
courage to do that because it's very frightening when your child is convulsing and it was 15 15 times every
2:55:58
night so it was a lot and they they diminished and after that um I I had to
2:56:07
sew and um I felt I have to to sew more
2:56:13

2:57:26
the lies have been louder i don't know if it means something but cuz the enemy
2:57:31

2:57:37

2:59:37

2:59:44

3:00:23
Jesus excuse me excuse me hallelujah hey for that family I'm not sure if you
3:00:29
could hear on the microphone there's this family from France she shared how
3:00:36
they went to revival is now was it um Netherlands right revival is now
3:00:42
Netherlands and he was having seizures 15 times a night and after that the seizure stopped
3:00:49
completely for a week but then the devil's a liar you know I I teach about this all the time how you you you'll be
3:00:56
free but then the enemy will come back with the same symptoms as when you were
3:01:01
oppressed but this time you're not oppressed he's just lying now it is a weapon formed against you that does not have to prosper if you reject it amen so
3:01:08
I teach so much about this in my book Maintaining Your Deliverance this is very common of a common scheme of his
3:01:15
where he'll come and be like he'll be he'll lie and say "You're not really free it was it was all fake you're not
3:01:21
really free or it came back he will lie in that way and if you accept the lie
3:01:26
that's an open door where he literally can't come back as a is demonic spirit as sickness but if you reject him and
3:01:32
say "No I know I'm free." Even though it feels just the same maybe as when you were oppressed but you say "I reject you
3:01:39
i reject your lies i am free and you cannot steal my freedom you cannot steal
3:01:44
my healing these seizures must go in Jesus name." Then he must flee and so
3:01:49
you didn't know about that yet but then you learned when I was on a Zoom call with you I taught you and then you
3:01:55
started rejecting the devil and then the seizures went away diminished hallelujah
3:02:00
praise God hallelujah praise God and they've seen she you were sick in many ways too
3:02:08
for and then you did and you didn't work for many years but now for four and a
3:02:13
half years but now God has healed you and now you're going back to work hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus thank you

3:02:36
does every miracle it was when they came under the shadow of Peter so that the anointing could hit hit them it wasn't a
3:02:42
one-on-one prayer simply the anointing touched them and healed them and freed them amen so this is how God is moving
