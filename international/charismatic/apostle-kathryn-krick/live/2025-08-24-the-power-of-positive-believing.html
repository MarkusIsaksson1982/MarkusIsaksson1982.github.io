48:37
you have a bed behind you or a couch because I'm telling you, you never know
48:42
what God's going to do. the power that will come and hit you in his house and
48:49
through the screen. Amen. Hallelujah. Um, I want to I want to welcome all of
48:55
you watching, all of our Fiverr family from around the world watching, all of the small groups around the world
49:01
watching. Welcome. I want to encourage you all and everyone here to share this
49:07
live stream with your friends, with your family. I'm telling you, I I I I I'm so
49:13
full of joy for the the the doors that God has opened through social media. I'm
49:18
telling you, this is one of those doors that God has opened that doesn't it
49:25
doesn't ma it's like people can try to shut doors in your face, but God finds a way to open up doors.
49:34
And um I just saw this today. There is a precious, precious, precious video of a
49:40
little boy who came with faith for his mom to be saved. This happened like a
49:45
year ago and we posted this video and the Instagram has this new feature where you can post a reel that will go to none
49:53
of your followers. Yeah, it's it's an amazing tool that can
49:58
be used to spread the good news. And so, man, God breathed on it. And in
50:04
just a couple days, it has it has like I think close to 350,000 views right now.
50:11
And this morning when I checked, 2400 people became followers through that
50:18
video cuz you can Yeah. Hallelujah.
50:25
You can track like the analytics like who becomes a follower through seeing that video. 2400 just from that one one
50:33
video. And and that's God breathing on it. That's God breathing on it. Hallelujah.
50:39
So that's 2400 people that might not know Jesus might not know about revival. Probably don't know about his revival
50:45
and his power. Hallelujah. So I want to just share that so so so you can all be
50:52
more encouraged and excited to share the good news because I posted that video as
50:57
if I had zero followers. Do you know what I mean? Because it it this feature that Instagram has, it pushes it out to
51:04
to no one that knows you, no one that follows you. So it's so so I share that
51:09
to say that even you sharing, if you have small followers, God can breathe
51:15
upon it and bless the work of your hands and use that staff like Moses, use what
51:20
is in your hands and do miracles upon it. Amen. And so never stop sharing these live
51:26
streams, never stop sharing these videos because the way that social media works, this is how we knock on the doors and
51:33
then God opens, you know, but we have to make the effort knock and the door will be open for you. So what that looks like
51:39
today, so much for spreading the the good news and sharing revival with
51:44
people, it looks like literally just sharing videos, even interacting with the videos. It's
51:51
like knocking on the algorithm's door, you know, and God opens it. Hallelujah.
51:59
Praise God. Amen. Praise God. Thank you, Jesus, for these open doors you have
52:05
opened to reach more people, for your kingdom, to come into your kingdom to know you. Thank you, Jesus. Amen.
52:12
Hallelujah. Um, I want to share with you right now a
52:18
video showing some of what God did last week at our baptism service. For those
52:25
of you that don't know, um, we we came here, well, the serving team came here
52:31
at around 10:00 and found out that there was a crane in this building working on
52:36
the AC, fixing the AC, and we would not be able to come in here for service. And
52:43
so the Lord had a greater plan for us last Sunday. He led us to the beach. He
52:49
led us to have a baptism service and to to minister to God's people on
52:56
the beach. And it was so incredible what God did. About 50 people were
53:02
spontaneously baptized and um so many people were set free. A
53:09
man came with crutches and he walked away without them. Hallelujah.
53:15
So, we're going to we're going to watch some of what God did last Sunday.
53:28
Somebody's coming out of the water. Hey.
53:35
Whoa. I was lost and I was broken. I was down
53:42
and I was out. Searching far and wide for peace, but it
53:48
couldn't be found. And then you came like a rush of water. Felt your presence
53:55
in the wind. Now I'll never be the same again since you brought me in. Say, "No,
54:03
I'll never be the same again. Since you brought me in
54:10
clean, been set free. Out of the dark, you carried me. Now my dreams are gone.
54:17
The new days come. Oh, hallelujah. My be took my soul.
54:25
With the blood, you changed my name. Now there's freedom for all sons and daughters. You are coming out of the
54:33
water.
54:39
Somebody say
54:46
all of heaven. I was singing for the one.
54:52
When I were walking, the God of miracles is here. Hallelujah.
55:02
is nothing to afraid. Got the Holy Spirit fire running through my vehic.
55:16
[Applause] [Music]
55:27
Oh, hallelujah. my life be. You took my sin. You took my sh.
55:34
You changed my name and freed
55:41
the water. [Applause]
55:51
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
55:57
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Man, God's ways are perfect. They're
56:04
higher than ours. Thank you, Holy Spirit, for what you did yesterday. Thank you, Holy Spirit, for
56:10
your perfect plans. We yield to you always. You know best. Amen.
56:16
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Well, I want to invite Marissa up to the stage.
56:24
She has a powerful testimony to share. She shared it on the live stream last
56:30
week after being baptized, but I'm not sure if the audio was that uh you could
56:35
hear very well. So, I wanted everyone to hear this powerful testimony.
56:40
So, it was last Sunday. It was a very special day.
56:47
What? What? Why was it a special day? It was my daughter's birthday. her fourth
56:52
birthday and then it was also my rebirth.
56:59
Yes. So, she's a miracle um through from God through the anointing in this
57:05
church. I was serving in the park in 2020
57:10
and I had the desire in my heart to have a child and my husband was told by a
57:17
doctor that he would likely need surgery to have children. And when I told him
57:23
this desire, he told me he didn't want to have surgery. And I told him that I
57:29
didn't want him to have surgery, but if it's in God's will, it will happen. So,
57:35
it wasn't happening. It wasn't happening. It wasn't happening. Um, but then one day, uh, Apostle prophetically
57:43
prayed over me in the park and it was at Echo Park, which God is so amazing. I've
57:50
been driving to church um to the Velasco since um the end of February. And today,
57:59
God had me take a different route. little God in Siri. And we uh it took me
58:05
past Echo Park and I saw Echo Park and the big fountains and everything. And that is the place where Apostle had
58:13
prophetically prayed over me where days later I conceived.
58:23
Yeah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord. So, so yes. So
58:30
now she's four and um has such a hunger
58:35
for people to know about this revival to share flyers and have me tell people
58:41
about 5F Church. We just had a divine appointment the other day. And she's like, "Mommy, mommy, he's wearing a
58:48
cross. Tell them about 5F Church." And like And then he's like, "This wasn't on
58:54
accident. Um, he had been seeking God and a church. So, I don't know if he's
59:01
here. He said he was going to come. I don't think he's here. Maybe another time. But, um, yeah. So, um, thank you,
59:10
Jesus. Like, he he orchestrates things so beautifully to have my rebirth where
59:16
I'm fully surrendered to God now and have my daughter's birthday on the same
59:21
day. Like, he's so intentional and it's so beautiful. Thank you, Jesus.
59:26
Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
59:32
Thank you, Jesus. Praise God. Praise God. Wow. I'm so in awe of Jesus. I'm so
59:39
in awe of him. And I see God releasing something to you right now and to your
59:44
daughter. She is truly so special. I've seen videos of her. She is so
59:51
spiritually mature and she has a fire for Jesus and a fire for this revival.
59:57
She repeats what I'm saying and she she pretends to be me. She puts heels and
1:00:03
carries a microphone. She takes videos. I put it on my story before. You've seen the stories probably if you look at my
1:00:08
story. But she she says things like revival is now. And she says things like
1:00:14
God is amazing. like like powerfully declares that as a three-year-old now
1:00:19
four, there's something so special on her life. And she was the first baby
1:00:25
conceived and one of the first miracles in this revival.
1:00:31
Hallelujah. Yeah. So, and Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:00:37
Yes. So, she's she's special. She's set apart. And um I just want to honor you
1:00:43
because you were serving when it was just John Tall and I. She would be there. She was there that day in
1:00:48
September where it was 100° and she was helping you were helping film I think or help helping serve and there was a woman
1:00:56
who there was only one woman I was preaching to and she left in the middle of the message and I kept preaching. I
1:01:03
just turned to the live stream. There might have been zero to 10 people watching. I don't know. But you and Jeal
1:01:09
were still there serving in that moment. So I just want to honor you for for
1:01:15
seeing this anointing when few did and obeying God. And I want to honor you for
1:01:20
for surrendering to Jesus this moment right now. He's so proud of you. And I
1:01:27
declare all of the mistakes from the past are gone. They're wiped away. And I
1:01:32
hear this verse God is saying right now. A righteous man f or woman falls down seven times but gets rises again. And so
1:01:41
he's saying you have risen. You have risen. You are truly righteous. You are truly chosen to be a revival warrior.
1:01:50
And God is honoring you for being there in the beginning and serving by putting
1:01:56
something so special in the spirit in your daughter. And she will bring so much glory to God and be used mightily
1:02:03
by God as she already is. But it will increase with every year as you stay obedient to God. It's flowing on to her
1:02:10
through you. Hallelujah. I release this anointing upon you. May
1:02:15
it extend to your daughter and may desires of your heart be fulfilled.
1:02:21
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:02:26
Everything that has that has bothered you, held you back, held back your family in any way, it must be removed in
1:02:33
Jesus' name. I speak the mighty grace of God to be more powerful than any resistance upon your life in Jesus'
1:02:40
name. And may you grow in the Lord every day. You and your daughter, your whole family, may they may you all grow and
1:02:47
grow and grow in Jesus' name. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:02:54
Hallelujah. Praise God. Thank you, Jesus.
1:03:00
Thank you, Jesus. Glory to God. Glory to God. I want to invite our Austria FA
1:03:06

1:03:40
Austria small group leaders. Yes. And I and I'm so proud of you and
1:03:46
how God is using you to spread revival and to to to stoke this fire in Austria.
1:03:54
Hallelujah. I would love for you to both share um your testimony and also what
1:04:00
God is doing through the small group in Austria.
1:04:05
Well, encountering the power of God at Fivefold Church changed my life completely.
1:04:12
I was an atheist my whole life and I didn't believe that that could be a god
1:04:17
above me. I was this bad person that condemned others and um had always
1:04:25
negative thoughts about others and had so much oppression like um I smoked
1:04:31
cigarettes about 15 years and I had um so many demonic soul ties
1:04:40
and um sorry
1:04:46
Um yes.
1:04:53
Oh my god. Hallelujah. Yes. Yeah. I had so much um demonic soul
1:04:59
ties and uh Jesus healed me from Hashimoto and
1:05:05
Yes. And then I I was searching
1:05:11
for something. I had this void in my heart and um but I don't I didn't know
1:05:18
what I'm searching for. And so I had this divine appointment with someone
1:05:26
um who told me about Jesus that Jesus can change my life. And for this time I
1:05:33
had a divine appointment because um I was ready to surrender actually. And so
1:05:42
I said yes. And and and I think I got baptized um um into the um Holy Spirit
1:05:51
um of the fire baptized at this time. And I
1:05:58
was searching for Jesus from this time on every day. I had this hunger for
1:06:04
Jesus. And I grabbed this um that Jesus Jesus can change my life.
1:06:11
And I went to local churches in Austria. And yes, they told me about Jesus. But I
1:06:20
didn't change. And I had this in my heart that there is more of Jesus. there is so much more of
1:06:28
Jesus because I I was still smoking and had um this um impure sexual behavior
1:06:36
and yes I was searching and uh for this time I met Marcus and uh we were friends
1:06:44
and um we recognized that we are both searching for the heart of God and so we
1:06:54
wanted more of God and Holy Spirit led us to go to America and before we had a
1:07:02
second divine appointment because someone told me he's actually not planned at 5F but he told us um if you
1:07:10
go to America you should go to fivefold church and I was wow what is it and I
1:07:17
went on your Instagram account and the first video I saw was the book
1:07:24
presentation of the secret of the anointing And at this time my English was so bad,
1:07:29
really bad. And but I I heard God saying, "You have to read this book."
1:07:38
So I ordered this book and as I saw the real of you, uh the anointing hit me. It
1:07:46
hit me. I felt the power of God and I didn't know the power of God before. It
1:07:53
was so amazing. And I ordered this book and first I have to translate it every
1:07:58
fifth word or so. But it was so worth it. And then immediately a grace, a
1:08:05
special grace came upon me and my my English improved that much that much.
1:08:10
And praise God. And I began to serve. The
1:08:16
anointing began to translate in German. Um, and all of the worldly desires
1:08:25
immediately broke off of me. It was amazing. And
1:08:33
um, then we came to 5F Church and you had this prophetic word for me and I was
1:08:39
shocked first. I was shocked truly um because I I I needed only needed healing
1:08:46
and deliverance and you said to me that so many people are being saved through me and healed and delivered and
1:08:55
for this time God pre I said yes it it took it took a
1:09:02
time but I said yes and to God and he prepared my heart so beautifully for him
1:09:08
and his people and um I received impartation uh at the first time. We
1:09:14
were in LA in October 2023 was the first time at the mission
1:09:21
road and um we came back home and my mom
1:09:26
was suffering so much trauma from the bust and at this time it was she was in
1:09:31
a very bad mood and uh I looked at her and saw her with the eyes of Jesus and I
1:09:39
thought I I will pray for her and I prayed for her and she immediately manifested Ed and I don't know what
1:09:48
left her but something left her and it was so powerful and then I released the
1:09:53
anointing I found here and I was fully in the new wine. Um I didn't know about
1:09:59
the power of God only about the book and the teachings and I received um the
1:10:05
teachings so easily. Yes. And um
1:10:13
yes, I just want to honor you, mama. Because of your ministry, I am able to
1:10:20
live a righteous life before God. It's supernatural.
1:10:26
Hallelujah.
1:10:32
You that I'm here, it is only Jesus. I am so thankful for all and for you
1:10:38
apostle very thankful for such a pastor and apostle it is really I'm so thankful
1:10:44
to Jesus all day thank you very much and I came to Jesus I was 18 before I live
1:10:52
not as a good life and I I'm Jesus so thankful that I come to him um and then
1:10:59
always I search for him and um I always started at this time and I
1:11:06
was in churches in youth groups and then I started to go parish school and to get
1:11:11
a a pastor and in this time it was so um I'm sitting in the parish school and I
1:11:19
was by a big pastor meeting in Austria uh the most of the pastors are there and
1:11:25
I always think there are so much beautiful things and so much great things in the churches but after the the
1:11:32
meeting I was so down. I cry and it was for two weeks I li I was in the bed and
1:11:40
I feel me so bad and I always think what what is this? Is this I am pride or what
1:11:46
is going on in my heart and then I always feel more and more that we are
1:11:52
going in Austria in circles and and there are things they are not here. We
1:11:58
need apostle and prophets. We only have a lot of pastors and we need
1:12:03
deliverance. In this time, I always think on that that I need deliverance. A
1:12:09
lot of the pastors and also the wives and the leadership teams are in bondage and so on. And I feel so the heart of
1:12:17
Jesus for all the Christians in in Austria and all the other people. Yes.
1:12:25
And in that time I was down um Vanessa came to me in the school. I'm a teacher
1:12:31
in the school and a very good friendship started and then I had a dream that we
1:12:36
are going in other nation and then we follow this um with our heart and then
1:12:42
we are coming here to 5F and I come in and it was in the other building. It was
1:12:49
for me I come home. It is it is the heart for me and I go um I was freed
1:12:56
also from stagnation resignation very strong I was complete free I stand up I
1:13:03
was so free I was so full with um revival with Jesus with fire with um
1:13:09
Holy Spirit and also the the thoughts they are um speaking against my identity
1:13:16
are gone and that is I'm really very thankful. And then we
1:13:22
are uh going back to Austria and at first we marry.
1:13:28
It was really uh um yeah a big present
1:13:34
and then the small group started and we are very happy now and I can really say
1:13:41

um a lot of members from the 5F in Austria, they are in flame in fire with us. And we are going out the last
1:15:00
months. We are going to different cities in Austria and we with flyers and books and all these things. And it is so cool
1:15:08
to see that Jesus is moving very strong in Austria. And yes,
1:15:15
hallelujah. Praise God. I want to also thank you for blessing
1:15:22
our city in LA because you I saw a testimony you shared yesterday where you know you're you all are here and you
1:15:29
took the time still to evangelize to spread this good news in this foreign
1:15:37
land where English isn't your first language and I saw this testimony of how
1:15:42
you went to a Christian bookstore I think it was downtown LA somewhere and
1:15:47
and the they you were looking for unlock your deliverance and they didn't have it and so you ended up telling the owner of
1:15:54
the store about revival about the book. He's ordering the book now and now he I
1:15:59
think he's entrusted to come to church. Is that right? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So, thank you for also
1:16:06
spreading this fire in LA as you're here. Thank you. Hallelujah. I want to
1:16:12
just speak over both of you right now. God is so proud of you. And truly, God
1:16:18
has big plans for revival in Austria. Big plans. And I can see it prophetically with the fire that is in
1:16:26
both of your hearts. It's a picture of the nation. It's a picture of the
1:16:31
hunger. It's a picture. It's a It's prophetic. This fire I see in your
1:16:36
hearts that you have had ever since you have I remember the first time you came. You had this hunger and fire. And so
1:16:44
this fire is growing and it's going to keep growing. God is so proud of you. I
1:16:50
am so proud of you. I release more of this anointing to you now for God to use
1:16:55
you in greater levels in this small group. I release more anointing to you now for God to use you in greater ways
1:17:02
for more miracles to take place. This revival fire to increase in Austria
1:17:08
through you in Jesus name. Hallelujah.
1:17:13
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Julia. Julia, it was amazing running into you
1:17:20
in Stockholm, Sweden. I was in Stockholm and um all of a sudden we're just like
1:17:27
walking towards each other in the streets of Stockholm and you had flyers in your hands with your cousin and you
1:17:34
were with you had just left a bunch of 5F family members from around Europe who were going throughout the city of
1:17:40
Stockholm spreading this revival now Stockholm flyers and you were going you spread to different places to spread
1:17:47
them out. Thank you for spreading this good news. Hallelujah. I would love for you to share your testimony of how God
1:17:52
has touched you at 5F. Okay. Um, so I first saw a video of you casting out
1:17:59
demons on Instagram and that was in the beginning of 2023.
1:18:05
And at that time of my life, I was seeking God with all of my heart. And I
1:18:10
had this desire to be just close to his heart and to know what he's doing now.
1:18:17
And um also I wanted to experience revival in my personal life but also um
1:18:23
revival in Austria but I had no clue what it should actually look like. I
1:18:28
read about um revivals in the past but I didn't know what God was doing today.
1:18:33
And also I had some experiences in local churches where um I saw people in pain
1:18:41
and um they opened up to me and they shared um about their struggles in life
1:18:47
and I wanted to help them but I didn't know how. I knew I'm lacking something and I didn't know I was missing the
1:18:54
anointing because I already believed in Jesus. I was raised Christian um but I
1:18:59
didn't know the power of God. And then when I first saw you ministering
1:19:05
um I was just so in awe of God and his power and I knew this is the love of
1:19:13
Jesus. And um back then my eyes um opened up for the first time because as
1:19:20
I said I was actually raised Christian but there was a lot of oppression in my
1:19:25
family and I didn't know that it was demonic. And then I saw that this was
1:19:32
not God's will for us, for my family. And I knew God is only good. And
1:19:40
yeah, I I just saw his goodness. And um
1:19:46
as I continued watching your videos, the live streams, and I was also attending
1:19:52
um several Revivalist Now events. My first one was in Rotterdam. um things
1:19:57
like religion, heaviness, and worry about my own life, my future, and worry
1:20:03
about my family fell off of me. And um Jesus also freed me from um sleeping
1:20:11
problems. So um I mean, last night I didn't sleep anything because I was so
1:20:16
excited, but um in general, I sleep so well now.
1:20:22
And that's truly that can only be Jesus because I had um sleeping problems my whole life like ever since I was a
1:20:28
child. And um he also freed me from sorrow. So um I used to be very down
1:20:35
about um what happened to my family and especially to my mom. And um now I know
1:20:42
that she is with Jesus already. And I believe with all of my heart that she's so excited about this revival. And um I
1:20:50
don't have any pain anymore. And it's so supernatural. And um I just have so much
1:20:59
love and honor and gratitude for my mom and this fire for others to be to be set
1:21:06
free on this side of eternity and for their hearts to be healed. And I know
1:21:11
it's possible because of the anointing. Hallelujah. And um
1:21:19
yeah, thank you Jesus. I I don't have any sorrow anymore. I don't have any
1:21:25
heaviness. I trust God now with my family. And um I have so much joy. I
1:21:33
have so much peace, contentment, and purpose. I I didn't have this vision for
1:21:40
my life before coming to 5F. I didn't really know what to do with my life. And
1:21:45
um now I just know how I can serve Jesus. And I'm being continually
1:21:50
equipped through your teachings. And God is always speaking to me through the prophetic anointing. And I know he's
1:21:56
directing my steps. And this is what I was wanted. I always wanted. I wanted to be in his will. And um yeah. Hallelujah.
1:22:06
I I also received um impartation of anointing just from watching your videos
1:22:11
already two years ago because um when I prayed for people things happened like
1:22:17
um the power of God manifested and I never experienced that before. I know it's just because of the anointing you
1:22:24
imparted to me. And um yeah, he he used
1:22:29
me um to cast out demons like of family members and friends. And one time not
1:22:35
long after the rise and shine conference actually. Um he used me to um heal a
1:22:41
colleague of mine, she she's not a believer yet, but she opened up to me and she said she had so much um pain in
1:22:47
her jaw and she wanted prayer. And I simply declared healing and and she felt
1:22:53
power she said and she was healed. She the pain was gone. Hallelujah.
1:22:59
Yes. And and before I didn't even try it. I was always afraid to pray for healing because I thought maybe nothing
1:23:05
happens. But now I know things happen because of the anointing and because of the equipping I received
1:23:13
from you. And I also received boldness. Um, I used to be extremely shy and now I
1:23:20
can even walk up to people and tell them about Jesus. And this can only be God. I
1:23:25
I know that's not me. And um, yeah,
1:23:31
that's about it, I think. Praise God. Hallelujah.
1:23:36
Hallelujah. God is so proud of you. And I see I see
1:23:42
just greater and greater and greater ways God is going to use you. I see God has put
1:23:49
leadership in you. I see you you you you leading you leading people many more
1:23:55
people to Jesus in Austria. He has such a great plan for you in the future
1:24:01
branch of of of Austria. 5F Austria. I see this. Hallelujah. I speak this fire
1:24:09
to increase in you now in Jesus' name. Let this anointing increase and more
1:24:14

1:24:20
Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Wow. Jesus.

1:25:42
September. This event, this event is hosted by
1:25:48
our 5F Netherlands small group leaders, Lisa and Wes.
1:25:55
And I'm so proud of them. They have put on this event. They invited me to

minister and I I'm just so proud of them for taking this step, stepping out in faith
1:26:08
and hosting this event. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:26:13
And there is so much hunger in the Netherlands. Hallelujah.
1:26:19
There is so much hunger that in the first week that registration was open,
1:26:24
1,000 people registered in just one one week. Glory to God. Well, the venue that was
1:26:33
originally booked holds about 1,800. Is that right? 1,800 people. So, you can
1:26:41
see that it is too small. So, the Lord is leading us the I I the
1:26:48
Lord is leading us to get a bigger space. And so, I advised Lisa as she is hosting
1:26:56
this event. I advised her uh to to look for a bigger venue so that no one is
1:27:03
turned away. We don't have to cap out the registration, but that all who want
1:27:09
to come can come. Amen. Hallelujah. So, I do want to announce those of you
1:27:16
that are planning to attend. The venue is now TBA. We'll let you know as soon
1:27:22
as we have found a venue and booked it. Um, and we are planning for this date
1:27:27
still, but um, there could be a possibility it's changed, but we're we're we will we are believing in
1:27:33
keeping it on the same date or right around that same exact date. So, just stay tuned. Um, and also this venue is
1:27:42
going to cost way more than was expected. So, though Lisa and Wes are
1:27:48
hosting this event, they are our 5F family. They are they have been planted at 5F for many years. And so I want to
1:27:56
open up we are opening up a fund now that you can contribute to this event on

1:28:22
heart for the people of the Netherlands and Europe. And I want to just speak to those of you watching in the Netherlands
1:28:27
and Europe. But I I really want to speak to you to to to encourage you to plant a
1:28:32
seed for your nation, to make a sacrifice for your nation, for your nation to have breakthrough, a seed for
1:28:39
revival to spread. Amen. Because to to to to bring revival in
1:28:47
your nation, it doesn't come cheaply easily in the spiritual realm which it
1:28:53
can be physical too because it takes money to put on events you know but this is a spiritual thing you are doing as
1:28:59
you make sacrifice and you sew seeds for revival to spread in your nation. Amen.
1:29:06
Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Thank you Jesus.
1:29:12
All right. Well, we are gonna get into the word of God right now. You ready?
1:29:22
Hallelujah. All right. So, this the title of this message is the power of positive
1:29:28
believing. The power of positive believing. Uh
1:29:36
we are going to go to Mark 11:22.
1:29:42
Then Jesus said to the disciples, "Have faith in God. I tell you the truth. You can say to this mountain, may you be
1:29:49
lifted up and thrown into the sea, and it will happen."
1:29:55
But you must really believe it will happen and have no doubt in your heart.
1:30:00
I tell you, you can pray for anything and if you believe that you've received
1:30:07
it, it will be yours.
1:30:14
How powerful faith is. How powerful faith is that it can move mountains. How
1:30:21
powerful faith is that anything can happen. Amen. Not just most things, some things,
1:30:28
anything. Can have anything. Anything.
1:30:34
When something seems so impossible, it is possible with faith.
1:30:42
Hallelujah. Now, this is a principle. To believe is
1:30:49
a principle of God. God is about principles. The Bible is not random. is not random
1:30:55
laws, is not random instructions from God, is not these random like um laws
1:31:03
that God is lording over us for like no reason. The Bible has principles in it.
1:31:13
God reveals his principles. You do this and you receive this. You do
1:31:20
this, you access this. You do this and
1:31:25
this supernatural miracle happens. There is principle after principle in
1:31:32
the word of God where God where God is speaking, teaching, revealing his
1:31:38
principles. We're talking about his kingdom. His kingdom has order. It has principles. So
1:31:46
many believers are blind to the principles of God and they're doing they're seeing the
1:31:53
word not with power. They're seeing the word of God as just something that they're supposed to read. So they read
1:32:00
it, but really they're not valuing and seeing the power
1:32:06
that God reveals principles of how to access the supernatural, of how to
1:32:12
access healing, deliverance, abundant life, of how to access total protection
1:32:19
from the devil, of how to access total victory,
1:32:24
overwhelming victory. It's all in the word, but you need
1:32:30
revelation. You need your spiritual eyes opened up.
1:32:37
And a big way that comes is through anointed teachings in a true church.
1:32:45
According to Ephesians 4:11-16, God gave the gifts of apostles,
1:32:51
prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. And the purpose of these gifts was to equip the believers so that they
1:32:57
would no longer be deceived by the by the schemes of the devil, tossed to and fro by different doctrines, the devil's
1:33:04
speaking old wine, but they would be equipped and brought into maturity. They would even be
1:33:10
equipped to do their own works of God. Not just to warm the pews,
1:33:18
but to be equipped to do what the ministers are doing, to cast out demons and to heal the sick.
1:33:26
It's like the testimony we heard. Praise God. Glory to God. She received impartation of anointing through the
1:33:31
screen. Equipping anointed teachings. So now she can cast out demons.
1:33:38
Amen. She can heal the sick by God's power. Jesus through her.
1:33:44
Hallelujah. So, I just paraphrase, by the way, Ephesians 4:11-16. I paraphrase that. This church's name has come from
1:33:51
that passage, five-fold church, the five-fold ministry. In order for the
1:33:57
body of Christ to be equipped to have victory over the devil, to walk in the anointing, and to cast out demons and
1:34:03
heal the sick, we need to do things God's way. We need to get the foundation in order. We need to have the five-fold
1:34:10
ministry. Not just pastors and teachers and evangelists, but we need apostles and prophets to bring this equipping to
1:34:17
open up spiritual eyes and to release impartation of anointing.
1:34:22
Hallelujah. That's what God is restoring in this revival. And because God's a God of
1:34:27
order, God has leadership. Revival doesn't happen halfhazardly randomly. But why this revival is so powerful and
1:34:34
lasting is that we are getting the foundation in line. It is being restored and there's order there and there's
1:34:41
safety there and there's protection there. So God is restoring the apostles and prophets in this revival and he's
1:34:48
doing things his way that we see from the Old Testament to New Testament pouring his anointing in servants of God
1:34:53
to for them to then release to the believers through the teachings through impartation through casting out of
1:34:59
demons and healing of the sick. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:35:04
Praise God. So many believers have been missing the principles. The principles that are in
1:35:11
the word of God. The another word for principles. If you wonder what principles means, it I God's ways. God's
1:35:19
ways of working. He doesn't move randomly. He has ways that he works,
1:35:26
principles in which he works. Um, and so
1:35:32
this new wine revelation is being released now in this revival through anointed teachings. And this is one of
1:35:39
the big keys of why people are being delivered, really delivered, keeping
1:35:44
their deliverance, walking in abundant life in this revival is that their eyes are opened up to
1:35:53
understand God's ways to really do what the word of God is saying and with
1:35:58
revelation and with joy to do what the word of God is saying because they have revelation. These are the principles of
1:36:06
God that lead to abundant life and protection and peace and joy.
1:36:12
That's that's that's a that's a big key why people are thriving and flourishing in this revival. Glory to God is because
1:36:19
their eyes have opened up to the principles of God. So faith
1:36:26
faith is a principle of God. One of the biggest principles
1:36:32
actually every principle includes this principle. Every other principle
1:36:37
faith. faith in God, in his realness, in his almightiness,
1:36:45
his in his in his majesty, in his power, in his kingship, lordship.
1:36:54
Faith that he always wins over the devil.
1:36:59
Faith that he loves you so much and he never leaves you. He will always protect
1:37:04
you. He will always defeat the devil in your life. Every battle the devil brings, faith.
1:37:12
Faith that his plans for you are so good. Faith that what you pray for you
1:37:20
will receive. What you ask you will receive.
1:37:25
This is a huge principle. And so many people they are asking they can be
1:37:30
asking God for things. They can be praying with all of their heart. They could be crying from the depths of their
1:37:36
heart asking God for something and believing as they ask. Maybe even just a
1:37:42
mustard seed of faith. But the problem is is that
1:37:47
many people don't have revelation of this principle of faith. They just pray
1:37:53
and that's it. They don't keep that faith alive in that
1:37:58
prayer that they prayed. And so you can be crying to God with all
1:38:05
of your heart and so much faith in that moment, but you will not re you will
1:38:10
probably not receive what you asked for if you let your faith out of your heart
1:38:18
after that moment. that when time passes and you haven't seen the answer to the prayer yet, that
1:38:25
when obstacles come and it feels like you're getting further away and it seems
1:38:31
more less likely that you'll receive the answer of this prayer that you give up.
1:38:39
Many people they are not receiving prayers, prayer requests that they have
1:38:45
asked God for because they're not using this principle of faith.
1:38:53
They've stepped out of God's principle. They are in the principle of faith asking believing as they ask but then
1:39:01
they step out the next day or a month later or when things get hard or when a
1:39:08
lot of time has passed. Are you listening? This is a big key I'm
1:39:13
revealing of how to see things you ask for come to pass in your life. Amen.
1:39:26
Life as a believer is not just sending prayer requests up
1:39:32
to God and just doing whatever the next day. Do
1:39:38
letting whatever thoughts go in your mind. Let it whatever is going on in your heart go. Life is not about
1:39:43
throwing prayer requests up to God. Life is about life as a believer. Life as a
1:39:49
believer is about stewarding your faith. in which you asked for that thing that
1:39:56
you would keep stewarding that faith until you see it come to pass.
1:40:02
That's what life as a believer should look like. That's walking in the principle of faith.
1:40:09
Amen. Hallelujah.
1:40:14
So um Genesis 11:1 it says, "Now the whole
1:40:20
world had one language and a common speech. As people moved eastward, they found a plain shinar
1:40:28
and settled there. They said to each other, "Come, let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly."
1:40:34
They used brick instead of stone and tar for mortar. And then then they said,
1:40:40
"Come, let us build ourselves a city with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for
1:40:48
ourselves. Otherwise, we will be scattered over the earth, over the face
1:40:53
of the whole earth." But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building.
1:41:00
The Lord said, "If as one people speaking the same," I'm going to restart
1:41:05
because this this scripture you need to really really listen to carefully. The Lord said, "If as one people speaking
1:41:13
the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will
1:41:20
be impossible for them." Wow. Come, let us go down and confuse their
1:41:26
language so they will not understand each other. So the Lord scattered them
1:41:33
from there all over all the earth and they stopped building the city. That is
1:41:38
why it was called Babel because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord
1:41:46
scattered them over the face of the whole earth. What is our calling as believers? To go
1:41:54
to the ends of the earth to make disciples of all nations.
1:42:01
That is our calling. We are supposed to have a heart for
1:42:07
people all over the world, not just people who look like us, who speak like us, who who live in the who have the
1:42:14
same culture as us. And so God was seeing an issue here.
1:42:21
These people are doing the opposite of my plan for humanity
1:42:27
to go into the ends of the earth. They don't want to be scattered all over the earth. So they are combating what I want
1:42:34
them to do in the future. They are trying to build a tower that
1:42:39
reaches heaven and be united in this and just be
1:42:44
focused on this one job and stay in one place. So this is so powerful. What this is
1:42:52
this is this is um this is God speaking this. Listen closely. This is God speaking this.
1:42:58
Genesis 11 verse 6. Catch this. Catch this. The Lord said if as one people
1:43:04
speaking the same language they have begun to do this then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.
1:43:11
They were so united in faith that God himself says nothing will be
1:43:17
impossible for them. So God had to intervene
1:43:24
and destroy what they were doing. This is the power of faith.
1:43:33
This is the principle of faith. You see the people, okay, people in the world,
1:43:42
if they are really nice to people. Now, maybe if they if they're not a
1:43:47
believer, if they're not a believer, maybe they have this ability that they're able to be nice to everyone. But
1:43:53
if they're not a believer, you you you can't be nice all the time because that's only the fruit of the Holy Spirit. You can't be kind always, right?
1:43:59
So maybe you're taken out at your husband at home or your wife at home or something, right? This is like people in
1:44:04
the world. You probably met people in the world that were really nice, but they didn't know Jesus, but you never encountered them being mean to you,
1:44:10
maybe in the workplace or something, right? That can happen, right? And these people that are nice to others, they're
1:44:18
sowing kindness. They're sewing kindness to others. And what you sow, you reap. That's a principle of God.
1:44:24
And so they're going to reap kindness. they're going to reap kindness. You can
1:44:30
say, "Oh, that's common sense. You're nice to someone, they're going to be nice back." But that's actually a principle of sewing and reaping.
1:44:35
Actually, it's actually a principle of God. And so, people in the world, they can use the principles of God. This is
1:44:41
what the devil does and why he has so much success. He uses the principles of God and finds some success. Never over
1:44:47
God, but he can find some success because he's using the principles of
1:44:53
God. That's why people they really think like
1:44:59
a new age they really think these these things you know you you you meditate on something you f yet they're they're
1:45:04
they're seowing focus focus I on this dream
1:45:10
and then they find themselves achieving the dream they're using a principle of God
1:45:16
but it's only when you give your life to Jesus that you have total protection in your life that you will have peace you
1:45:21
will have joy the blessings of God come without sorrow Bro, so the world can use
1:45:26
it. The devil can use the world can use new age people. They can use principles of God and find some results, find some
1:45:34
success, but they will never find salvation, peace, joy, contentment, they
1:45:39
will probably have demonic oppression. Though they're achieving dreams and success or getting money and what have
1:45:45
you. That's the thing. But what you need to understand is the power of God's
1:45:52
principles. that they work. So there there's people in the world
1:45:58
thriving, applying God's principles, thriving uh financially, and God wants
1:46:04
believers to thrive financially for his kingdom. But many believers are blind to the
1:46:11
spiritual realm. They need the anointed teachings. They need the five-fold ministry. They need to accept revival
1:46:17
where they receive these things. But they currently don't have this equipping. So they are not using God's
1:46:24
principles and they're not thriving. This is the power of God's principles.
1:46:31
Many successful people that you'll find on this in this uh in the world, they are probably using God's principles.
1:46:37
Many without knowing it. God's principles are so powerful. They work.
1:46:42
And so that's what God's saying right now. These people, they were not subscribe. They weren't worshiping God.
1:46:49
But yet he was saying that if they apply God's principle of faith of collective
1:46:56
faith even more powerful uniting together and believing in what
1:47:02
they are doing nothing will be impossible for them they will accomplish it.
1:47:07
It's time, children of God, to use the principles, the powerful principles God
1:47:14
has given us as children of God, to flourish and thrive in every area for
1:47:23
God's glory, for his kingdom to advance. Amen.
1:47:28
Hallelujah. Matthew 18:19. I also tell you this, if
1:47:36
two of you agree here on earth concerning anything you ask, my father in heaven will do it for you.
1:47:44
So there is a great power, even greater power when more than one person together
1:47:50
believe together in something for God to do according to God's will. This is the
1:47:57
collective faith that we're seeing. So powerful, the the people building this tower.
1:48:03
How powerful when we believe together when we are are are responsible to
1:48:09
steward our own faith and then we add that to the collective faith of the work
1:48:16
of God of this revival. It's like it's like a revi we are a
1:48:22
revival army. How powerful we will be when we all do our work in the gym in
1:48:28
the spiritual gym. How much more powerful will we all be when we're exercising our faith muscles,
1:48:36
stewarding what God has given us, getting huge faith muscles in the
1:48:41
spirit. What a power what a more powerful revival army that will be
1:48:48
than than an army where just a handful have the big faith muscles.
1:48:55
The devil will go down so much more. God will do so many more wonders. Many more
1:49:00
people will come into the kingdom when we each work out spiritually to build these faith muscles big so we can all
1:49:08
stand together and believe with all of our hearts. Amen.
1:49:13
Hallelujah. Okay. So now I've explained faith and
1:49:19
how powerful it is. I want to ex to teach you right now what faith is. how
1:49:24
to have faith because a lot of people don't know what that is. A lot of people think it's
1:49:30
about waiting for a feeling to come. A lot of people think some people are just born with a greater with a with a
1:49:38
huge faith and you weren't with as much faith. So that's just how it is. Nope. You're wrong. Faith is a matter of
1:49:45
obedience. Faith is a matter of obedience.
1:49:52
Romans 12:3 uh it it it says it's it says that we
1:50:00
cannot please God without faith. The Bible says
1:50:06
Hebrews 11:6, it is impossible to please God without faith. Do you think God
1:50:13
would ask you to do something that you couldn't do because you weren't born with it? Absolutely not.
1:50:21
If God is saying, "You can't please me without faith," you better believe. He's given you everything you need to have
1:50:27
faith. First of all, it says in
1:50:33
um Romans 12:3, "For by the grace given me, I say to every one of you
1:50:38
um wait, I'm going to skip to the end of this. Romans 12:3 in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of
1:50:46
you. That means that God has distributed a
1:50:52
measure of faith to every one of you.
1:50:57
You already have it from God, but it's your job to steward it.
1:51:04
You could lose what he's given you if you don't steward it. But if you steward
1:51:09
it, if you steward it really well, you take it seriously, stewarding the faith he's given you, it's going to grow and
1:51:16
grow and grow and grow and grow bigger and bigger every day. If you make that choice, this is why I say faith is a
1:51:22
matter of obedience. Faith is a matter of obedient
1:51:28
to being childlike to just believe.
1:51:33
Doesn't make sense. It's not logical. But I am called to be like a child.
1:51:41
So I will be childlike. I believe Lord. I lay down all the questions.
1:51:48
I I stopped focusing on all the questions, all the logical questions and
1:51:53
I simply choose to be childlike. I will simply believe in you, Lord. Faith is a
1:52:00
matter of being obedient to be humble. To be humble is a choice.
1:52:06
Why isn't this working out? I've been serving God. I've been I've been reading the word. I've been I've been doing I
1:52:12
think all he's asked me to do. And how come I'm not seeing this breakthrough yet? I will stop asking questions and I
1:52:18
will humble myself. God's ways are higher than mine.
1:52:24
His ways are not my ways. I humble myself. I don't doubt God. I
1:52:29
choose to not doubt God. I humble myself. That's faith. I humble myself and just
1:52:37
believe. I just choose to believe. I'm not going to go there. I'm not going to go there in my mind. I've done this.
1:52:42
I've done this. I've done this. How come God isn't showing up? I'm not going to go there in my mind. If I start to go there, I'm leaving that place and I'm
1:52:48
coming back to the childlike humble place. I just trust you, God. I trust you, God. You are good.
1:52:57
Faith is a matter of being obedient to reject every lie of the devil.
1:53:07
Being obedient to God's word where it says take captive every thought and make it obedient to Christ. Submit to God.
1:53:14
Resist the devil and he has to flee. So faith is a matter of being obedient to reject every lie of the devil of doubt
1:53:23
to reject every thought that's going against what God has spoken the promise
1:53:28
what you have prayed for. That's faith.
1:53:34
Faith is a matter of being obedient to put your thoughts on all that are
1:53:41
lovely, admirable, worthy of praise, all godly things, keeping your eyes on
1:53:47
Jesus, choosing to focus there and not looking other places. That's how you
1:53:52
steward the faith. Faith is a matter of being obedient to guard your heart.
1:54:02
Faith is a choice. It's not about your feelings. It's not about feeling such
1:54:08
great fire for God. It's a choice. It's about obedience. So, everyone can have
1:54:15
faith. Every one of you can move mountains for every one of you. Nothing is impossible
1:54:21
if you will choose to have this faith and steward this faith. Hallelujah.
1:54:29
You know, in that scripture that I read, um,
1:54:35
Mark 11:22, there's a part where it says, "But you must really believe it will
1:54:42
happen and have no doubt in your heart."
1:54:47
You must really believe it will happen for it to happen and have no doubt in your heart.
1:54:53
Now, that doesn't mean that if a thought comes your way of doubt, oh, too bad.
1:54:59
You're not receiving that prayer request. You're not receiving that promise. The mountain's not moving. Uh-uh. Because the devil sends thoughts
1:55:07
to everybody. But what God counts as you guarding your
1:55:16
heart and not doubting but believing
1:55:21
is your obedience to reject the thoughts, reject the lies. So those come
1:55:28
and you say, "Uh-uh, that's not me. That's not my truth. That can't stay in
1:55:34
my mind. That can't stay in my heart. I reject it and I choose to believe again.
1:55:40
I chose to believe yesterday and I choose again to believe today.
1:55:47
You got to be spiritually mature and recognize those thoughts. I know they'll they'll feel like it's you, but it's
1:55:53
not. Grow up. Grow up. You know better. You know the devil comes sounding like
1:56:00
you sounding like God in the thoughts and the mind. But whatever comes in your
1:56:06
mind or your heart that does not align with God's word is the devil. Period.
1:56:19
You don't have to get down anymore. Just simply recognize this is a spiritual war and I'm going to have victory through
1:56:25
Christ. I reject it and I'm seeing that mountain move.
1:56:31
I am stewarding this faith in my heart. By this action, you are really believing
1:56:37
it will happen and having no doubt in your heart. You're keeping your heart clean. You're you you're you're keeping
1:56:43
the door shut on your heart so no doubt can come in. Hallelujah.
1:56:54
Uh uh uh Mark 11:24 Passion translation says, "This is the reason I urge you to
1:57:00
boldly believe for whatever you ask for in prayer. Be convinced that you have
1:57:05
received it and it will be yours." Be convinced.
1:57:11
Don't hope to have the feeling of being convinced. Be convinced by stewarding
1:57:17
the faith in your heart, guarding your heart. Hallelujah.
1:57:27
So what are you putting in your heart? What are you allowing to come in your heart?
1:57:36
Your meditation. So, so, so when thoughts from the devil come, if you don't reject them, it's the action of
1:57:41
meditating on them. It's the action of accepting them and meditating on them.
1:57:47
As a man thinks, so he is. The Bible says whatever you meditate on becomes
1:57:53
what you believe. Whatever you meditate on becomes what you speak eventually.
1:58:01
And your words have so much power. Your words it the the life and death is in
1:58:07
the power of the tongue. The Bible says. So you can either make the mountain move
1:58:13
with your mouth or you can open the door for demonic oppression and do the opposite
1:58:20
with your tongue. Your meditations
1:58:28
and your words create your belief.
1:58:35
So what you're choosing to think on, what you're choosing to speak,
1:58:40
that becomes faith.
1:58:46
That be I if you're if you're choosing to only focus on the truth, God's word,
1:58:51
rejecting all the lies, and you're choosing to positively confess, then faith grows in you. And this is
1:58:59
where you become convinced in your heart. This is where that mustard seed
1:59:05
grows to being convinced that it will happen. Big faith.
1:59:13
But if you're meditating on negative things, on doubt, and you speak negative things, you speak words of doubt. I
1:59:19
don't know if this will happen. That's become your belief, a bad belief,
1:59:24
the opposite of true faith in God.
1:59:31
And that's where the prayers, you won't see your prayers come to pass. You won't see the mountains move.
1:59:47
So faith is a result of what has been in your heart. is what you have chosen to keep in your
1:59:55
heart that determines your faith. The size of your faith.
2:00:02
Hallelujah.
2:00:09
So I want to share some wisdom in how to guard your heart, how to steward this
2:00:17
faith. Be mature in the spirit.
2:00:23
You've learned a lot. If you're new here, you can learn a lot in a short amount of time. Go to my Revival Army
2:00:29
training playlist on YouTube. Watch at least a message a day. You'll be you'll be you'll be growing real big in the
2:00:35
spirit real soon. Amen. There's a lot of meat, spiritual meat. God will go fast to help you to equip you.
2:00:44
Um, you need to fill yourself with the word of God, the written word of God and
2:00:49
the teachings so that you really know that you know that you know who God is,
2:00:55
his character, how big he is, his goodness, his faithfulness, his
2:01:01
principles, how he works. The more you understand how he works, the bigger your
2:01:07
faith is because it's not this like I don't really get God. I don't know why
2:01:12
he's allowing this and but you'll have this knowing if God is allowing this. This is refining fire time. This is for
2:01:18
my good. He he he he he works out all things for good according to for those called according to his purpose. What
2:01:24
the enemy intended for evil, God intended for good. God knew this was the devil was going to
2:01:30
send this this my way. But the Bible says he will not give any anything any temptation that I won't be able to
2:01:35
overcome. So just like he did with Job, God sees I'm ready for a test. I'm ready to go to the next level. I'm ready for
2:01:41
reward in the spirit. I'm ready for more anointing to increase in my life. So, test time.
2:01:47
Look, you know, this is the the m the mature mind in the spirit.
2:01:52
You know what's going on. When you don't know what's going on, you know God knows what's going on.
2:02:00
He has a plan. God's in control of this. I can't wait to see what he's about to do.
2:02:08
This confidence in your God, this can only come with filling yourself. This
2:02:14
can only come by filling yourself with the word of God. Filling yourself with the word of God is
2:02:20
going to build your faith to to to know you can trust God and understand his ways
2:02:26
so you never doubt. You're never in this place of confusion. I know God is good, but I just don't understand why this is
2:02:33
happening. There will be no more of that when you grow in the spirit.
2:02:39
When you when your eyes open up, when you mature, there'll be no more of that. God's got this.
2:02:46
His ways are higher than mine. He's in control. Can't wait to see what he's about to do.
2:02:52
Place of peace, a place of confidence, constant faith.
2:02:58
Praise God. So, hallelujah.
2:03:05
Um, so be mature in the spirit. Remember, so often what God says will
2:03:11
happen. It will seem impossible many times, but God makes it to happen every
2:03:17
time. It's in the word of God. So many times
2:03:24
where things seem so impossible, but God does a miracle. splits the sea, makes
2:03:30
the walls to come down, raises Jesus from the dead.
2:03:36
I mean, there's a whole lot of evidence God has
2:03:41
given us that nothing is impossible for those who believe.
2:03:47
So, be mature in the spirit. Renew your mind. When things seem impossible, no, nothing is impossible. Why would I even
2:03:54
think, how is this going to happen? Duh. God, miracles, signs, wonders.
2:04:03
The King of Kings sitting on the throne will make it happen.
2:04:09
Grow up in the spirit. Renew your mind to be to stay in that place of maturity.
2:04:16
So often it feels like the promise is delaying. So often it does. But guess what? The
2:04:23
promise comes to pass every single time.
2:04:29
example after example in the word of God. Israelites, it took them a while, but
2:04:35
they made it in the Joshua generation. Joseph, it took him a while to see that
2:04:43
dream fulfilled. He was in the prison. He was in the pit. But guess what? That
2:04:48
promise was fulfilled.
2:04:53
God has a a perfect track record. perfect. It's not 99%
2:05:01
perfect track record of being faithful, of doing what he says he's going to do, of bringing about the promises to come
2:05:06
to pass. You can know with all your heart that if you believe it will happen.
2:05:13
[Applause] So, grow up to renew your mind of this truth that's so obvious and you know it.
2:05:19
You know it. So, remind yourself of it. Don't cause yourself to Don't allow yourself to forget it. steward this what
2:05:26
you know. So often there's no sign you're getting closer to the promised
2:05:31
land. Sometime sometimes there can be a temptation like
2:05:36
a temptation thought like this is this doesn't seem to be working.
2:05:42
But every time God comes through in a suddenly moment and it happens.
2:05:51
Pharaoh said no a gazillion times.
2:05:57
You can't say no to God. When God says yes, nobody can say no.
2:06:04
So Moses goes up. Moses, Aaron, ask
2:06:10
Pharaoh, "Let my people go." No, no, no. This doesn't seem to be working.
2:06:15
It's about to work. God's ways, you're about to see them work.
2:06:22
So, so this truth, this truth that though things seem to not be working,
2:06:27
the promise is delaying, seems like they're going backwards, expect a suddenly moment
2:06:34
rather than giving up and thinking this doesn't seem to be working.
2:06:40
Amen. So, so, so these are just some
2:06:45
some keys I shared with you of how you can steward faith so that you can move mountains.
2:06:52
Amen. And there's a word right now here that God has for you, prophetic word for for
2:06:59
this whole revival army right now. You know, look at what God
2:07:04
spoke to these people who were not even worshiping God, doing their own thing,
2:07:10
doing something that God didn't even want them to do, was the opposite of what God wanted them to do, building this tower. And God said to them, their
2:07:18
collective faith, their united faith is so powerful that nothing's impossible
2:07:25
for them. That what they set out to do, it will happen. If our God said that
2:07:32
for people who were go not even go who were going against him, not people who
2:07:38
were with him. What about us? What about the revival army that has been called
2:07:44
and sent out by God himself who has been anointed by God? Who is
2:07:50
doing God's true mission? What about this army of God? What about what we put
2:07:58
our faith in? And so God has this word right now. He
2:08:03
want He's saying for your eyes to open up to see the power that you have when
2:08:09
you believe that God has called you to do such mighty things in his kingdom to
2:08:16
spread this revival. to spread this revival in LA, in your
2:08:22
family, in your workplace, across America, to spread revival in your
2:08:27
nation, in Austria, in Mexico. Hallelujah.
2:08:34
In all of these nations of you that are here, all of these nations watching, all of these cities watching, God is calling
2:08:42
you to do powerful things for Jesus to spread his revival in your city and your
2:08:48
nation. And there are demonic mountains out there that do not revive, want revival. There are demonic Pharisee
2:08:56
religious mountains that are coming against revival, that are coming against God's move. There are demonic worldly
2:09:04
agenda mountains out there, demonic mountains, people of the world who do not want
2:09:10
revival. There is a devil out there who does not want revival.
2:09:17
But God says when you speak to this mountain, move and believe in your
2:09:23
heart, do not doubt that it will that it that it won't happen. It will move. And
2:09:29
not just that, anything will be possible for you.
2:09:34
Anything. It is God's will for this revival to
2:09:40
spread all over LA that there would be thousands upon thousands coming to the
2:09:45
church services every Sunday. That's God's will. That's God's plan.
2:09:51
It is God's will that this revival would spread mightily in every city and every
2:09:56
city that you live in, in every nation that you live in. It is God's will and
2:10:02
plan that so many people will be delivered, healed, saved. Encounter
2:10:08
God's power and love in his revival in every city that you belong to, every
2:10:14
nation you live in. This is God's will. This is God's plan. God has sent you to
2:10:21
carry this fire, to be the light of the world, to bring this good news, to bring
2:10:27
the hope of the world, to bring the power of God, this anointing,
2:10:32
fire of the Holy Spirit to your city, to your nation. Many are called, few are
2:10:39
chosen. If you're listening to me right now, God is choosing you. If you will choose to be chosen, if you will choose
2:10:45
to believe and surrender and believe in God, he's saying you are chosen. It's up
2:10:51
to you. He's calling right now. But if you will choose, yes, you are chosen.
2:10:56
You are chosen. And so I'm telling you, I am telling you that you will be in awe
2:11:03
of what God will do through you, of what God will do in your nation, in your city
2:11:10
if you rise in faith. If you will, if you will increase your faith, if you
2:11:15
will steward your faith, if you will reject every doubt, every lie of the
2:11:21
devil, if you will mature in the spirit, [Music] you will change your nation, you will
2:11:28
change your city. The disciples of Jesus, 12 disciples,
2:11:34
12 normal, average Joe people just like you and me. They were not superhuman.
2:11:39
They were they were just like you and me. Just like you and me, they change the
2:11:44
world. They change the world.
2:11:49
It's even easier for us today because we have all these tools they didn't have. We have social media. We even have a
2:11:56
microphone. I mean, but they changed the world because they believed,
2:12:03
because they united together in faith and became unstoppable in their faith,
2:12:09
constant in their faith. Is anybody with me?
2:12:16
[Applause] [Music] Can Can you Can you rise your faith?
2:12:24
Raise your faith as an action of faith. Raise your faith right now. Stand up as
2:12:30
an action of faith. As an action of faith. I'm telling you,
2:12:35
God has this plan today to to to to release this revelation to literally
2:12:40
open up your spiritual eyes to see the power of what you already
2:12:45
have, the power of faith, to see that you can do so much more just by
2:12:50
stewarding your faith better. You can move mountains. Woo! Woo!
2:13:00
You, you, little old you, can move mountains, can
2:13:08
change the world. I'm telling you,
2:13:13
God's ready to take this revival to a whole another level. This is the year of acceptance. We're about to see God open
2:13:20
up doors that no man can shut. We are we are about
2:13:27
we are about to see God bring victory upon victory and spread his revival with greater
2:13:33
fire. But he needs the army to be vessels to rise up because he moves upon
2:13:40
faith. The faith arises and God moves the mountain. So there's plans that God has even in this revival to open up
2:13:47
doors but he works with us. There's there's demonic mountains.
2:13:53
There's religious mountains, but it's up to us to move them. [Music]
2:13:59
It's up to us to believe, speak to the mountain, and God comes
2:14:05
then in power to move that religious Pharisee mountain and to open up the
2:14:11
door. And so, this is a prophetic word I'm saying right now because Jesus spoke
2:14:17
this to the disciples. He's like, I'm about ready to commission them to go out in the world, but they got to be strong
2:14:22
in faith to cast those devils out. They got to be strong in faith when they go in the prison. They got to worship God
2:14:28
still and believe. And then the the doors will open up after they praise God. The prison doors will open up.
2:14:37
You see, so he spoke that with purpose because he was ready to spread his revival all over the world. So he spoke
2:14:44
this, believe. When you speak to that mountain, it will move. So God is speaking this
2:14:51
prophetically now. God is ready to move greatly to to move these mountains, but
2:14:56
he's going to do it in response to our faith. He's going to do it as we rise up collectively together, steward our faith
2:15:04
even better, and and work out in the spiritual gym to have bigger faith
2:15:10
muscles. And then we will be speaking to that mountain. will stand together and God
2:15:16
will move those mountains through us. Hallelujah.
2:15:22
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Rise up army of God. Rise up. Shine
2:15:31
brighter. Believe bigger. [Music] Speak with authority.
2:15:37
[Music] Guard your heart. Trust in our God.
2:15:44
For he is mighty to save. He'll deliver and open up any door and move any
2:15:51
mountain. Hallelujah. Amen.

Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
2:16:01

2:16:16
the fire of God to come upon you all. Let there be an increase of fire in
2:16:22
Jesus name. May you arise stronger, stronger, stronger in faith, stronger in
2:16:29
heart in Jesus' name. May you grow and grow and grow from this day. May you
2:16:35
grow taller in the spirit, bigger in the spirit, bigger faith muscles from now in
2:16:40
Jesus name. And this army I declare is unstoppable. This revival army shall speak to the
2:16:47
mountains and they will move. And I speak and and and will you believe with me right now? Will you believe with
2:16:53
me right now as I declare to these mountains right now? Will you stand in faith and believe with all your heart?
2:17:00
Do not doubt with your heart at all. I declare right now
2:17:06

2:17:25
It's done. It's done. It's done. I declare every religious spirit,
2:17:35
Pharisee spirit that blinds people, that holds people back from encountering
2:17:41
Jesus in his revival. This Pharisee mountain must move in Jesus' name.
2:17:53
I declare this mountain of demonic evil lies.
2:17:59
the accuser of the brethren working through people, so-called believers,
2:18:05
so-called servants of God. This demonic mountain of false accusations that blind
2:18:12
people from coming into the move of God and receiving Jesus. This mountain must
2:18:17
move in Jesus' name.
2:18:25
And this demonic mountain of the devil's lies sending to people making them
2:18:31
skeptical of deliverance and the anointing making them hesitant making
2:18:36
them afraid making them confused. I declare this demonic mountain must move
2:18:43

2:19:12
move in Jesus name.
2:19:18
And I speak for every city and nation where there is a small group right now.
2:19:24
I declare every demonic mountain that is hindering people to come to the small
2:19:29
groups for people to come into this revival. This demonic mountain must move now in Jesus name.
2:19:38
And I declare every principality, every demonic territory of the devil in
2:19:44
every one of your cities and nations watching online that's trying to block people from receiving Jesus. I declare
2:19:52
that your city belongs to Jesus Christ. And Jesus Jesus is king. He reigns over
2:20:00
your city. [Music] The devil cannot have any territory. I
2:20:07
declare [Music] this revival must spread to the ends of
2:20:12
the earth. And I declare every principality, every
2:20:17

Close your eyes and take a moment with Jesus right now and surrender to him whatever he's leading you to surrender.
2:23:48
Maybe some of you have not been stewarding your faith. Maybe some of you have allowed doubt in your hearts. You
2:23:53
have not guarded your heart. Repent of this and and surrender everything to Jesus right now. Make a commitment to
2:24:00
God. Make a covenant with him right now. That you would have faith always in him.

2:24:15
this faith that he's grown in you.
2:24:23
And I encourage you to just speak to Jesus, surrender to Jesus. If you've never put your faith in Jesus,
2:24:29
I encourage you to put your faith in Jesus today and give him your life. You just have to tell him like, "Jesus, I
2:24:35
give you my life. I surrender to you. You are my Lord." And he becomes your Lord. And the Holy Spirit comes in your

2:36:02
Spirit. and to and for his newborn daughter um Natalie and that they all three of them and whichever children God

time and they don't want to work. They don't want to do anything.
2:39:10
This terrible want to have a family like that with bad spirits. That's bad.
2:39:17
I see God moving in power right now and breaking this generational curse now because of your faith. Because there's
2:39:24
people in the Bible, the parents came for faith in their children and the curse was broken and the spirits left
2:39:30
them because of the faith of the parent. So God moves the same today. I break
2:39:36

break these curses of witchcraft now in Jesus' name. And I break every
2:40:49
generational curse. I detach you from all these things. And I declare every spirit attached, every spirit of
2:40:56

2:41:49
Thank you, Jesus. What are you believing God for today? Um, just to heal me from
2:41:58
temptation. um from caring more about what people think than the calling that I receive
2:42:03
from him because I do believe that I have a a great calling from God and I have a power to influence others. It's
2:42:09
just I can be so stuck up here in my head and uh he's already making a way. He's already delivering me, but I just
2:42:15
need total deliverance and I need total freedom to conquer Satan and his temptations against my heart, my purity,
2:42:22
my life. Um and it's already happening. Amen. Are you here in LA or are you
2:42:27
visiting? In LA. You're in LA. I see a great calling on your life. Truly. Yes. Thank
2:42:35
you, Jesus. I see I see God has great plans to use you mightily in this city,
2:42:42
in this revival. I see a lot of people I see a lot of men and of and and women
2:42:49
that it's like God's putting put something special in you where they will be drawn to the words you speak to just
2:42:57
listen to to what you say about God. He's put something special in you where where where where he has called you to
2:43:04
reach many people who cannot be reached by others. Thank you, Jesus. And now it's time to
2:43:10

2:51:03
to use you powerfully to spread this revival
2:51:09

2:51:20

Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
2:52:17
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
2:52:26
I believe right now more miracles will happen than any Sunday because God God
2:52:32
has taken us glory to glory. He's he's opened up your spiritual eyes layer by
2:52:37
layer by layer. And the way he's opened up your spiritual eyes to receive more faith today is bigger than ever. And so
2:52:45
I believe those mountains that didn't move before because of lack of faith, they will move in your lives now.
2:52:53
Every yoke must be destroyed in this place. All sickness must be healed. You
2:52:59
know, in the times of Peter, when all were healed under his shadow of anointing, all were healed, all were
2:53:05
delivered, it was for two reasons. One, because he carried a high enough level
2:53:12
of anointing that no demonic power could could compete, could fight it. Every
2:53:19
principality even had to leave people. And number two, because the people believed, because the people had faith,
2:53:27
because they were taught teachings like we heard today where their eyes were opened up to receive. Their eyes were
2:53:33
opened up to have big faith. So, it's time for the book of Acts to come alive
2:53:40
like never before. I believe I believe that all can be healed today. all here,
2:53:48
all watching online can be healed and delivered today, right now. Are you
2:53:54
ready to receive? Hallelujah. If you need to renounce anything, if you
2:54:00
have demonic oppression, if you have sickness, start renouncing it now. Start speaking. Start renouncing specifically
2:54:06
the oppression in your life right now. Start renouncing the sickness. Start speaking it aloud now.
2:54:14
Those of you watching, start renouncing. And if this is your first time, whatever is not from God in your life, anxiety,
2:54:20
depression, addiction, sickness, just say, "I renounce whatever that is." This is one of the keys that unlocks your
2:54:26
deliverance. This is taking your stand, speaking to the mountain, and it has to move by God's power now coming.
2:54:33
Thank you, Jesus. I detach you all from what you have renounced, from what you
2:54:39
are renouncing. I break every curse. I break every generational curse. I break
2:54:44
every word curse, every curse of witchcraft. I break every demonic soul tie now in Jesus' name.
2:54:53
Children and adults alike, let's honor God. Children, children, let's honor
2:54:58
God. Okay, this is important. We have the fear of God and honor him. Amen.
2:55:05
I declare right now every demonic spirit attached to what you renounced must go
2:55:12
now in Jesus name. I declare every spirit of addiction must go. I declare
2:55:20

2:55:38

2:55:44
Every spirit speaking against your identity, speaking in your mind, negativity, it must go in Jesus' name.
2:55:52
And I declare every spirit that is holding you back from your calling, from being a mighty vessel of God, it must go
2:55:59
in Jesus' name. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Lord. I see

2:57:55
Whatever miracle that you have needed in your life that you came desiring God,
2:58:01
praying that God would do today, I release this anointing upon all of you.

3:01:40
head back to your seats for for a moment right now.
3:01:46
[Music]
3:02:00
We are going to give to God right now. I believe that today from today you will
3:02:06
be a more cheerful giver than ever. Why? Because your faith has increased.
3:02:15
And the Bible says that whenever you sow, you reap. The Bible says that whenever you bring
3:02:22
your tithe, when you give to the kingdom of God, God then pours out so many blessings upon your life that there's
3:02:31
not even room for all of them. Do you hear me? Even multitask those of
3:02:36
you making your way to your seats because this is important you hear.
3:02:41
Are you ready to be more of a cheerful giver than ever before? This pleases God. This pleases God when
3:02:48
we're obedient to give and also when we give cheerfully. When we give with faith, when we give with faith, knowing
3:02:55
that God is going to bring blessing, he's going to bring a reaping upon these seeds. Amen.
3:03:03

3:03:34
want to encourage also those of you in Paris and France and New Zealand to sew a seed, to make a sacrifice for your
3:03:41
nation because there's so much power in that. Um, and as I mentioned in the beginning, we have the Netherlands event
3:03:47

3:04:04
how to give to those specific funds. And I I want to thank all of you who contribute to the work of God here every
3:04:09

3:04:16
be here. We can do the work of God and do it with excellence how God wants it
3:04:21
to be and reach the most amount of people. Amen. So I want to thank you and I want to
