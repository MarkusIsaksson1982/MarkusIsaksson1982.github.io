38:49
nation Hallelujah Um and I also want to share everyone who is watching online Make
38:55
sure you share this live stream with your friends and your family with everyone on your social media pages This
39:01
is the biggest way that the word gets out and using our social media pages
39:06
is one of the wisest and most important ways to spread the gospel It's it's the
39:14
it's the biggest tool that God's given us because there's so much power in it
39:20
Power of influence even if you don't have many followers That's what happened to um Rebecca last week She shared she
39:27
had only 400 followers She didn't put any hashtags on the video and the video was anointed Her daughter we shared it
39:34
last week if you don't know what I'm talking about but her daughter praise um shared principles of God that she
39:41
learned here that she learned at the Arise and Shine conference about how to reject the devil when he's trying to
39:46
attack and trying to stop you and God was telling her to preach but then the enemy was telling her to not and was
39:53
bringing symptoms of a cold and she said "Get behind me Satan Shut up Satan
39:59
And she's six six years old right six And the video went so viral like almost
40:07
half a million views And then I posted it and now the one that I posted I think
40:12
has a couple hundred thousand at least views Glory to God
40:18
But but you know that's just so powerful She had like 400 followers Is that right
40:24
400 followers And look at what happened when she used the tool that was in her
40:30
hand that God gave her because it's anointed It's like Moses's staff Moses's
40:35
staff He says "How will people know that you've sent me how will the how will how
40:41
will really you be able to use me God?" And God says "Throw down the staff that's in your hand This the the
40:48
ordinary staff The ordinary staff that you already have Throw it down." Meaning
40:54
use it use what's in your hand in obedience to me And when he did it a
41:02
wonder took place And he did wonders through that which revealed that God was
41:08
with him which led him to fulfill his purpose which ended up leading him to
41:14
lead millions lead the Israelites out of Egypt to the promised land I mean just
41:20
from using what was in the hand you see the power you have the power in social
41:27
media So that's why I say it's the one of the most important tools that God has given us You don't have to have a huge
41:32
following You don't have to have a huge influence if you're obedient God will do wonders through you now Amen Hallelujah
41:40
So share share share online and um get excited and expectant for Jesus to come
41:46
and touch you through the screen every one of you wherever you are watching in the world Hallelujah
41:54
Amen I'm so excited for Revival is now Toronto It's this week It's this week
42:03
Canada I am so excited for what God is about to do Get ready Invite everyone
42:08
you know Come hungry Come ready and expectant God is gonna move so

45:39
sharing And we're so blessed to have you here home
45:45
Hallelujah Praise God Praise God
45:50
Well I'm going to share a message today called Wise Servant of God
45:56
We're going to go to um Luke
46:02
2:49 Before we go there what I call you all are warriors
46:11
of God Warriors of God in God's revival
46:17
army That's who you are warriors
46:22
Yes you are Christians which means follower of Jesus You are disciples which means a
46:29
student a learner student of Jesus and student
46:34
here of of of of the teachings here in this place where you are called to be planted to be equipped to be a powerful
46:41
vessel of God Amen But you are also a warrior
46:50
Warrior And why this is a really powerful
46:56
identity for you to know that that is who you are is that God has called you on this
47:05
earth to be a powerful vessel of him And in order to be a powerful vessel of
47:12
him who carries his power and love and his light you have
47:19
to be a warrior who fights the good fight of faith Shining your light and being a
47:26
vessel of God doesn't come just easily without a fight
47:36
But the thing that the devil hates the most is when you release God's power and
47:44
love his light And so when you do that the enemy is not happy and he will try
47:51
to stop you but he will fail when you know how to fight the good fight of
47:56
faith And and and Paul says this he says to Timothy "Be a good soldier of Christ
48:04
endure persecution with me alongside of me Be a good soldier That's a scripture
48:11
in the Bible that Paul says So he gives that identity that title of a soldier or
48:17
warrior And there's also a scripture that says "Fight the good fight of
48:23
faith." Which to summarize just means to follow
48:29
God and what he is calling you to do which is in his word which is in the
48:35
present tense word of God spoken through teachings that gives revelation of God's word and prophetic word like a now word
48:42
like revival is now The direction is not to pray for revival anymore but step
48:48
into revival and carry the revival torch and release revival and proclaim to
48:53
everyone that revival is now And be active to spread revival and proclaim
49:00
that revival is now Amen Hallelujah
49:07
So as you as you so you you were called to release the light the word the the
49:14
anointing of God and the enemy may try to stop you When he tries to stop you you reject his lies and you just keep
49:21
doing what God has called you to do to spread this revival to proclaim that
49:27
revival is now to share his love and his power with everyone You just keep doing
49:32
it The devil tries to stop you you reject him and he must flee So we can't stop you as long as you don't let him
49:40
Hallelujah Um and so when you really carry the anointing when you carry the power of God the enemy will try to stop
49:48
you And so that's why it's so important that you see yourself as a
49:55
warrior Not just as a Christian follower but a
50:01
warrior a soldier So every day you know I am a warrior So
50:07
if if if I have to step in battle all right I'm ready I'm equipped I have the
50:12
armor of God already on I'm renewing my mind constantly so
50:17
the devil can't trick me I know his battle plan I'm ready I'm prepared When
50:23
he tries to attack this is what I'm going to do I'm going to reject him I'm going to keep on doing what God has
50:29
called me to do Period Hallelujah
50:35
So this is what we have to do every day We are warriors who fight the good fight
50:41
of faith and have victory and victory and victory again day by day by day
50:47
Devil keeps being mad Devil may try to stop again but he keeps losing because we know who we are We are
50:55
warriors And we are not just warriors We are champions We are victorious warriors
51:02
of Christ Hallelujah So to to so to serve God to be a servant
51:08
of God means to be a warrior And um it says in Luke 2:49 "And
51:15
he said to them why did you seek me?" This is Jesus speaking "Did you not
51:23
know that I must be about my father's business
51:29
did you not know that I must be about my father's
51:35
business it is every single believer's calling to serve God to therefore be a
51:43
warrior of God Not a bystander not a civilian Christian
51:50
but a warrior of God which means to be
51:55
about your father's business And what is your father's business to
52:01
reach the lost to reveal his love to the lost to reveal his power and love to the
52:10
oppressed and to the sick to the spiritually dead
52:16
to release his power and love to the world So they so people so people who are in darkness may see this great light
52:22
of Jesus and come to him and and find not not only salvation but true abundant
52:29
life This is every single person's calling on this earth And I talk about
52:35
this a lot here So many people are wondering what their purpose is This is your purpose You don't need to search
52:41
any longer To be a warrior of God to serve God to be about your father's business
52:50
Every single day we should show up to work and be about our father's
52:55
business and serve him Do something do many things to advance God's kingdom to
53:02
do work for the father's business every single day You're not supposed to
53:09
sit around and wait You're not supposed to sit around and wait for someone to call you for someone to promote you for
53:16
someone to give you a position for someone to prophesy to you Go now and shine your light
53:24
David David when he was anointed when he was
53:30
found by God to be a man after God's heart and then God decided I'm going to
53:35
anoint him and then he sent Prophet Samuel to anoint him to prophesy his
53:40
calling to be king and to anoint him At that time when God did that and David
53:47
was anointed David wasn't chilling on the couch waiting for the
53:53
prophet waiting for the prophecy to come waiting for my calling What's my
53:59
calling he wasn't sitting around crying cuz he didn't know his calling yet
54:06
He also wasn't trying to force himself to be something
54:11
important force himself to be king try to network so he can be favored by the
54:19
current king and get great positions and the army and stuff He wasn't doing
54:24
that He was being a servant He was serving his father He was doing what his
54:30
father told him to do Take care of the sheep Take care of the sheep He was not
54:36
doing a glamorous job He was doing a boring job a lot of the time mundane job
54:43
difficult job fighting away lions and bears to protect the sheep Didn't get
54:50
any applause It's just God seeing what he's doing And his father his
54:56
parents and that is the place where he was anointed and he received his calling
55:02
and he was promoted And so so many pe so so often people
55:09
many believers are churchgoers and they they they are just
55:15
waiting to serve God They're waiting for someone to tell them to serve God They're waiting for someone to prophesy
55:21
to them to anoint them someone to notice them when that's not the way That's not
55:29
the way to get God's attention That's not the way to show God that you were after his heart That's not how to
55:35
be after God's heart How to be after God's heart is to be about the father's
55:43
business So what that looks like today is to be active in serving God in
55:49
whatever the Holy Spirit's leading you to do It's not complicated Shine your light Love people
55:57
well Be intentional Be intentional and purposeful when you go about your day I
56:03
want the light of Jesus to shine through me I want to make someone smile I want
56:09
to plant seeds so someone they feel they want to start talking to me more so I can then talk about Jesus because we
56:15
don't want to force Jesus on people We want them to open up and and and and and
56:21
desire to hear what we have to say Amen I want to love people so well that they
56:29
see my light and they're attracted so that I pull them to Jesus I
56:35
pull them to want to know more about Jesus I pull them to want to know more about my light about why I'm so joyful
56:42
and kind That's how we should go about our days Doing that is serving
56:47
God Serving God is doing anything that contributes to the work of God The work
56:53
of God is the ministry is the ministry of Jesus It's the preaching of the gospel It's the making of disciples the
57:00
equipping of the believers It's the healing of the sick and it's the casting out of demons It's
57:07
the workings of miracles signs and wonders to point to Jesus and reveal his
57:12
power and love and that he is Lord and King and to give him glory
57:21
So that's the core of the work of Jesus are these things and we show love to
57:27
people and we plant seeds and we we we we shine our light to bring them to the
57:35
work of God of the preaching of the gospel the healing of the sick the casting out of demons Sometimes you may
57:40
cast a demon out of someone You may pray for someone and they're healed You may preach the gospel to somebody But lots
57:46
of times when you go about your day-to-day life God is calling you to plant seeds shine the light that leads
57:53
them to a church where the gospel will be preached to them where they will be equipped they will be made disciples
57:59
they will they will be made into disciples they will be healed they will be delivered Amen
58:05
So to serve God to be about the father's business is to do anything that's
58:11
contributing to the work of God Every believer needs to be planted in a
58:18
church where God's power is That's God's will And that's the only way that people will not stay baby lukewarm and and
58:26
beaten up by the devil That's the only place where they will be equipped to be
58:32
mature vessels whose spiritual eyes are open who can now know the devil's schemes and have victory over the enemy
58:38
who can now receive impartation of anointing They've been moved to surrender because of the power of God
58:44
revealed in their lives Hallelujah They will receive impartation of anointing and they will be able to be a powerful
58:50
vessel of God Not just any old way not the way they think best not in a prideful way but truly in God's order
58:57
and with humility and purity Because this equipping this growing this
59:03
impartation has taken place in the church in the real church the true church that is pure that has pure
59:09
leadership that can lead them the right way that has the right example for them
59:14
to follow So this is the only way that believers will grow to be pure
59:22
Christlike and have victory over the enemy and be able to be powerful vessels of God themselves is if they're in planted in a church where God's power
59:30
is It doesn't have to be one specific church It doesn't have to be 5F church but it needs to be where God's power is
59:37
truly moving and where there is truly purity at the heart and in the
59:43
foundation Hallelujah Amen The kingdom of heaven must be present The Bible says "When I
59:49
cast out demons by the finger of God you shall know that the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
59:56
Hallelujah Praise God So it is all of your callings to serve
1:00:04
God to do anything that's contributing to the work of
1:00:09
God So a lot of this looks like serving in the church serving outside of the church in
1:00:17
ways that help the ministry like things like editing for example or moderating
1:00:22
or translating We have Spanish translation Portuguese translation happening every service Praise God
1:00:28
because people are serving So that's one of the ways that you serve Another huge way that
1:00:35
everybody can serve is by sewing contributing financially to the work of God because to be here costs thousands
1:00:43
of dollars every single Sunday to and and and and we glory to
1:00:49
God we we we are now at a place where where we God is calling us to host our
1:00:55
own events We hosted all of the conferences last year 5F Church but now
1:01:00
we're not sitting around waiting to be invited somewhere you know No we are going out into the world and making
1:01:08
disciples of nations and hosting our own events So we have a bunch of events that
1:01:16
we're going to be announcing soon They're going to be happen happening about once a month or more often
1:01:22
actually sometimes And one of them is Toronto that we are
1:01:27
hosting And some of these some of these events cost $100,000 just for a 2-hour
1:01:32
event because of the venue that's needed And it's not just the venue it's the lights and it's the audio and it's the
1:01:39
cameras and it's the live stream It's a lot of things that go into it that you'd have no idea unless you like plan an
1:01:47
event yourself And that's not even advertising We don't pay money really for
1:01:53
advertising We would like to we would like to to reach our people though if if pe if people want to give more There's
1:01:59
more we can do Amen Sometimes people a person would
1:02:04
donate money to for a billboard They said I want there to be a billboard so more people can see We've had billboards many times That was from someone with
1:02:11
his precious heart who who's planted at 5F who did that Praise God So yes these these events cost a lot
1:02:20
of money And so to serve God in this way is a big work you are doing that is
1:02:27
being a about your father's business because your contribution is
1:02:34
leading to thousands of people being healed delivered saved encountering
1:02:39
God's power and love Hallelujah I just happened to see um I don't have
1:02:46
them here to show right now but it just came to my mind We had posted a video from Revival is
1:02:53
now Philippines this past September where 8,000 people came and
1:03:00
glory to God Hallelujah And we just posted a video just like a video you
1:03:06
know it happened all the way back in September but we just posted just a couple days ago a video from that event showing God moving in power And there
1:03:14
was so many comments in the YouTube on the YouTube video of people testifying
1:03:20
of so many miracles they received One person was was healed of autism The
1:03:25
child is so transformed now Another person had an addiction to cigarettes
1:03:30
for years and this gentleman the got free completely of it Had no desire when after that
1:03:39
event And these are just there's so many testimonies So many I was overwhelmed
1:03:45
just reading them all Just people testifying of what happened last September Praise God You I posted them
1:03:51
on my Facebook page and on my Instagram story So after this you can check out you can read some of them But praise God
1:03:59
But those things happen cuz we went there You know like people can receive
1:04:05
online but there's some things that it's we need to step there and that's when people invite their family and friends
1:04:11
where the family and friends wouldn't watch the video you know or because it's in person God has something even more
1:04:18
powerful in store for people and does even more miracles than what they were receiving online you know and so that's
1:04:26
why this is a great great work of God that God has sent us to do is putting on
1:04:32
these events but they cost a lot of money So this is a big way if you're wondering how to serve God this is an
1:04:38
area where there is a need because we want to do more events because this is what God wants us to do Amen
1:04:48
Hallelujah And another way to serve God to be about your father's business the one of the biggest ways is to share your
1:04:53
testimony and share all of the videos and all of the things all of the the the
1:04:59
ministry that's going on Share them Share them Share them on your social media pages This is a big way you can
1:05:04
serve God So if there's not a place right now that you don't know of how you can serve in person maybe you're don't
1:05:10
live in LA there's huge ways that God is calling you to serve him and do powerful
1:05:15
things for him to advance his kingdom and be about the father's business Amen
1:05:25
Hallelujah So get busy with the father's work
1:05:31
Get busy If you're not being busy get busy Do not sit around and wait for a
1:05:37
promotion wait for a prophecy That's not how God lifts you That's not He'll wait
1:05:45
until you start serving him so that he can see that you are faithful and he can
1:05:51
trust you that you're a good steward The Bible says "Who is faithful with little
1:05:57
will be faithful with a lot." So if you're not faithful with a little you won't be faithful with a lot So if
1:06:02
you're not faithful with a little then God won't give you more That's why I say get busy or you'll never be able to
1:06:09
serve God more You'll never be able You have this big dream in your heart I want to serve
1:06:15
God And you're like I don't know how There's so much to be done now
1:06:21
Start so God can give you more because there's great work to be done but he's
1:06:26
waiting for you He's not going to distribute his important works that require so much responsibility and
1:06:32
excellence He's not going to give it to people he can't trust This is precious valuable work Amen
1:06:41
And so you know I remember when I was um I just graduated college I was 20 uh
1:06:48
what was I 20 20 How old are you when you graduated college 23 23
1:06:55
I graduated in 2013 Man when time passes you you forget
1:07:01
I graduated college in 2013 And um
1:07:08
and I remember asking God Lord what is my calling i'll do anything Like what is
1:07:14
it where do you want to send me lord I'll go anywhere What what is what should I do with my life i don't know
1:07:21
And I wanted to know the answer Then I wanted God to you know direct me clearly then but I didn't have a clear direction
1:07:28
I felt this pull to move to LA and to pursue acting because acting and singing were my biggest passions So I felt this
1:07:36
pull and looking back I know that it was God using using something using a desire
1:07:42
in my heart to get me to LA to the physical place where I would receive this prophecy over my life and to this
1:07:49
great city of angels where revival has broken out so many times to start his
1:07:54
revival to be to to be a place where his revival would pour out and go around the
1:08:00
whole world Hallelujah But God didn't give me that direct
1:08:05
prophecy that direct this is how you're going to serve me This is your calling He didn't give me it give me that back
1:08:11
then But I came out to LA and I just felt this hunger for God like never before And I started seeking God like
1:08:18
never before in my life And and I kept finding more of him because the Bible says when you seek him with all your
1:08:24
heart then that then you'll find him So I started seeking him with all my heart like never before And I started finding
1:08:29
more of him And then I just felt this desire in my heart and this calling from God to serve to serve him to serve him
1:08:36
to serve him And so that led the church that I was in at the time that church I
1:08:42
didn't that I had no clue at that time about the power of the Holy Spirit about the baptism of the Holy Spirit about
1:08:48
miracles and deliverance and healing I had no clue about that back then at that church But there was a church in LA a
1:08:54
big church that I attended for a few years and I served and served and served
1:09:01
for years I I would I remember I served in
1:09:07
every area except for one I served um with the ushers with welcoming people
1:09:15
with talking to people afterwards with doing the offering with um I served with
1:09:22
the the youth And so I would help them with like the Sunday school teach lessons I would sometimes act out like a
1:09:30
sermon type thing a Bible story I would um lead worship for the children And
1:09:36
then I would then I was on the main worship team team I did that as well And then I was a stage manager And so I
1:09:42
would have a headset and be in the background and I would tell the pastor and the worship team when they're supposed to come out And I would bring
1:09:49
this table and the iPad and the water out with my headset And then one time I
1:09:54
was asked to be the production manager even though I had knew no had no idea
1:10:00
how to do that And that was a very technical thing I'm not really a technical person I'm more of like a creative person But um I had to like
1:10:07
spend hours the night before like writing out the whole sequence of the
1:10:13
order of church and it was so it was like a mega church So it was
1:10:18
very precise detailed Everything was perfect
1:10:23
and in on time And so I remember being my headset and I had to
1:10:29
say Q stage manager Q for for like the first song or something Cue the person
1:10:35
that put the the the lyrics up Q I was saying standby to all of them Stand by
1:10:41
lights Stand by the whatever it was called the screen the words Stand by
1:10:46
stage manager I think I said their actual names Stand by with the worship team Go for worship team Go for the the
1:10:54
lights Go for the the the the words Go for the stage Go go go go go It was like
1:11:00
so intense and it was really not a strength I wasn't that great at it but God got me
1:11:05
through And I was so nervous to like get on a microphone and talk to the worship team and be like "All right are you
1:11:13
ready to run through the rehearsal?" But I did that And I remember I would spend two hours the
1:11:18
night before just like writing in that script like this the the events the the
1:11:23
you got to say Q to this person before this song and then Q before this one to this next song and and then for the sermon Q to everybody and the and the
1:11:30
exact time it's going to be this song is three minutes and so you know and I remember I would be I I would have to do
1:11:37
Bible studies sometimes at 6:00 am when I would serve in in that way and so I would do the Bible study at 6 am for the
1:11:43
for the um the production team and then
1:11:48
um we had four or I think even sometimes maybe five services and so I was like in
1:11:56
intense mode really like sweating like like every single service and so I was
1:12:03
there from 6:00 a.m like intense working until like 900 p.m or something with
1:12:11
just like an hour break Um and I wouldn't do that like every single Sunday It was like a rotation but if I I
1:12:18
was there the whole day regardless And you weren't paid anything which it was it's serving God you know But I was
1:12:24
doing those kinds of things serving in every area except for like hospitality I think is the only place I didn't serve
1:12:29
in I was doing that for like three
1:12:35
years My whole entire Sunday like morning to night just
1:12:40
serving And at the same time I'm inviting people wildly to church I'm
1:12:46
bringing droves to church basically anyone I can So serious about inviting people to
1:12:53
church And I share that because it was that season It was right around that
1:12:59
season where I received the prophecy for my
1:13:04
life I wasn't sitting around I wasn't sitting
1:13:10
around God was seeing I was after his heart God was seeing I was about my
1:13:16
father's business for years I was doing that At the time I
1:13:22
thought I was going to be a Christian music singer I had no idea this was God's plan for my life but I wanted to
1:13:28
be in his will more than anything So the Lord was showing me last night He's like "You are like David with the sheep."
1:13:36
You know like I had to see that you were really after my heart Being after God's heart is not about emotions and words
1:13:44
It's about action That's how God sees that you're really after his heart After his heart is to be
1:13:52
about his business because his whole heart is his
1:13:57
business The business of saving souls and revealing his love and power to them and delivering them and healing them
1:14:05
That's God's whole heart
1:14:10
Hallelujah Praise
1:14:19
God Praise God So you don't need a position a
1:14:27
title to be a warrior of God Amen
1:14:32
And I want to teach you some wisdom now in being a warrior in being a servant of
1:14:41
God So the wisdom I want to share with you that the Lord wants you to receive today first of all is
1:14:48
that you need to know that the devil hates what you're doing when you serve
1:14:53
God He hates it more than anything He's not happy So you you need to
1:14:58
expect that he's going to try to stop you You got to expect it You got to be
1:15:04
ready You got to know his schemes And so the way he tries to stop you these are
1:15:10
his schemes to bring lies of insecurity that you're not good enough
1:15:16
to bring lies that what you're doing isn't important because you're not
1:15:22
seeing the immediate results of what you're doing Many times you don't you don't see
1:15:30
the direct fruits and increase from what you're doing many times And hey I could
1:15:38
even take this for myself I know that there are way more testimonies than I
1:15:45
actually hear Probably just a tiny percentage of are
1:15:50
the ones I actually hear And I know that because many times when I get to meet people face to face or
1:15:56
when people come and share their testimonies here like from coming from traveling from somewhere or if I'm doing
1:16:01
a book signing sometimes somebody will share it with me and I'm like "What you never shared this send us an email Send
1:16:09
us a video We got to share this good news Don't wait for years later to just
1:16:16
tell me This is for the whole world
1:16:22
Hallelujah And so even me I know there's so much that I don't even see the direct result of If I saw the direct result of
1:16:29
it oh boy I don't know of everybody I would probably be flying out
1:16:35
here I mean I'm already full of so much joy but what I'm trying to say is like
1:16:40
there's a difference of like when you're planting and you're not seeing the fruit but then when you plant and then then
1:16:47
then you see the fruit Oh what joy that is you know
1:16:54
hallelujah And so but anyways when you are in the beginning of your serving God
1:17:00
and your beginning doesn't mean just day one It can be year one year two year three year four and it's still like
1:17:07
beginning time because in the grand scheme of things it's the beginning time It's a laying the foundation It's it's
1:17:12
beginning It's still in the the the field with the sheep
1:17:17
time So in the beginning times um you're you're you're planting and not seeing
1:17:24
the fruit right away It's years before you see the fruit
1:17:30
sometimes And in this beginning time God does a great work in you to
1:17:37
mold your heart to bring humility in your heart more humility in your heart
1:17:44
to build your faith to test your loyalty to God your faithfulness to
1:17:50
God to build a strength in you where you can persevere through
1:17:57
anything because you kept going without
1:18:02
seeing results and fruit but you just kept going and going and going because that's what God asked you to do Amen The
1:18:12
Bible says Zechariah 4:10 "Do not despise these small beginnings for the
1:18:18
Lord rejoices to see the work begin."
1:18:25
Hallelujah Anything that is big has to start small
1:18:32
There's no other way A house doesn't begin as a house It begins with a
1:18:38
brick With one brick That's how it begins And so with what God is calling
1:18:46
you to do in your life if your life is a big skyscraper in terms of your
1:18:52
calling you have to start with a brick that you can't fast
1:18:58
forward You have to start small That's the only
1:19:04
way And um it's in the in the times of of the
1:19:14
beginnings God takes you through a time where you will do things that are uncomfortable You'll do things you don't
1:19:20
want to do They're not fun And maybe there's a temptation to give up sometimes because it doesn't
1:19:27
feel like it's fruitful what you're doing But God is asking you to keep on going and serve him just because he's
1:19:34
telling you to serve him And don't worry about the results Don't worry about seeing it grow God will take care
1:19:43
of it God will do it God will be faithful
1:19:48
He will be faithful to water and bring to fruit to bloom every single seed you
1:19:53
sow Amen This was my small beginnings I remember
1:19:59
um I hosted my spiritual father Prophet George Davi I hosted him at a conference
1:20:05
Um this was the first year after the first year of receiving my calling and
1:20:11
being a spiritual daughter of him And it was a couple months after I started Fivefold Church We had a different name
1:20:17
at the time but we started as worship nights on Mahaland Drive And I started
1:20:23
there with me and a couple friends And I just made a sign out of a foam board
1:20:29
from Target And I didn't play guitar very well but it's all we had was my
1:20:35
limited basic guitar skills And so I bought a guitar from Guitar Center I
1:20:40
bought other things from Guitar Center like a speaker and a music stand and a mic stand And I went on that mountaintop
1:20:46
and I joined like 30 Facebook groups Christian Facebook groups And I posted
1:20:52
every single week sunset worship nights in these Facebook groups and people
1:20:59
would come from seeing them in the Facebook groups Couple people would come many people wouldn't come back but every
1:21:05
time there would be one to seven or so that would show up And it was so
1:21:11
uncomfortable for me to preach Preaching was my biggest fear and weakness Public speaking was my biggest fear and
1:21:16
weakness And the enemy would speak so often these insecurity lies You're not good enough You're not a powerful
1:21:22
preacher And look people aren't staying So they're obviously not being blessed These are the things I would hear in my
1:21:28
mind every single time but I just kept preaching That was the uncomfortable time of my small beginning But God was
1:21:34
calling me to do that The devil was a liar And as I obeyed God he was going to move
1:21:41
upon that obedience like he moved upon Moses's staff And he did He moved upon
1:21:46
my words even though they were babyish at that time Like I wasn't fully grown yet I was It was a small
1:21:53
beginning but he was faithful He was faithful to mature me and to make this
1:21:59
gift grow in me as I just kept persevering through that small beginning Amen And so a couple months
1:22:07
after doing those worship nights I hosted my spiritual father for a conference here and I didn't have any social media I mean hardly any social
1:22:14
media following in LA So if I were to you know make a post on Facebook or
1:22:19
something which I did like inviting people to the event I did many posts but I don't know how many people would come
1:22:25
from that because not many people were coming to my worship nights So I knew that I had to get God was calling me to
1:22:31
be about my father's business more to be creative to come up with ideas of how to
1:22:36
get the word out to more people And I knew the power of God moving through my spiritual father I didn't want the
1:22:41
people in LA to miss this I I I wanted the people to value it and to receive and be delivered and healed and receive
1:22:48
the prophetic anointing upon their lives And so I made a lot of efforts I went to
1:22:53
the print shop and I ordered tons of flyers and I ordered even a magnet that was this big Then I put it on my car my
1:23:00
Jeep Compass I drove around LA with the sign on the door Prophetic
1:23:08
Healing Conference And and I found out when um
1:23:14
some events were happening um downtown LA and I stood outside with the flyers
1:23:20
and as thousands came out of the Microsoft arena I handed them to people
1:23:26
for hours and so many people rejected them It wasn't comfortable But I remember one
1:23:33
man at that conference was touched so powerfully by God through the anointing moving through Jesus moving through my
1:23:39
spiritual father And he said "I came because because I found this flyer and
1:23:46
actually I remember I went to like Pi Hop and I laid the flyers down in Pasadena on a table and he said "I saw
1:23:52
the flyer there and then I saw you handed it out there." So I knew it was a sign I had to go Glory to God
1:24:00
And I think about a hundred or so people came to that event which was such a miracle considering there was no kind of
1:24:07
following or people didn't really didn't know my spiritual father or me in LA Um
1:24:12
but God moved upon that obedience Hallelujah But this was the small beginning was
1:24:19
like doing things that were uncomfortable and timeconsuming and so many peop so much rejection and feeling
1:24:26
like it's not doing much but just doing it because God is asking you to and
1:24:31
believing that he will be faithful to water that seed and nothing matters but
1:24:37
serving him and being faithful to what he's asking you to do Amen Hallelujah
1:24:44
The small beginning continued It wasn't just one year That was one year into it But then we were in a church basement
1:24:52
hidden from from people from the public But that's where our our theater was where we had church And you had to go
1:24:59
through an industrial kitchen to get in there And we were small We had like 15
1:25:06
to maybe 20 people And after that we then moved to Pan Pacific Park Senior
1:25:11
Activity Center which is like a gymnasium which has a stage And there we
1:25:17
got smaller We had about 15 people that year and then the next year and then the next year there was 10 And the next year
1:25:23
there was five And we would have worship nights on Friday nights and and Sunday
1:25:28
services on on Sundays And we it was a gym so it would look just like a gym So
1:25:35
we wanted I wanted it to look nicer so more you know and put effort and
1:25:40
excellence for Jesus So we got creative and I ordered these things from Amazon and got these like rigs that looked like
1:25:47
that kind of but it would have a long pole and we hung up like curtains all
1:25:52
around We just were doing these creative rigging things and we would keep all of
1:25:57
that and all of the speakers and all of the equipment and the whole drum set and even the big subwoofer that's this big
1:26:05
Um and the podium and literally all of that equipment we kept in my tiny dining
1:26:12
room of my tiny North Hollywood two-bedroom apartment So I didn't have a kitchen
1:26:17
table I would just eat on the couch so that the equipment couldn't be in the dining room table And so it was pretty
1:26:24
much like this whole all this whole area all full of equipment And we'd spend
1:26:30
about one to two hours loading all of the equipment going down the elevator
1:26:35
putting it in my Tahoe and another person's pickup truck and then driving
1:26:41
to Pan Pacific Park and setting up everything That took about two hours to set up everything And I was doing all of
1:26:48
that We'd only had a couple people helping doing that Few people doing that And then after the service was over we'd
1:26:54
take about two hours to take everything down And we load it back in my Tahoe My Tahoe was filled completely and um a
1:27:02
pickup truck And we drove it back to my little apartment brought everything up the elevator with many many many trips
1:27:09
and put everything back in the my dining room Two days every week So that's like
1:27:16
that was like I mean maybe 12 hours every week just loading things doing
1:27:24
that like hard labor work John Tall and I were there doing it There was a couple other people too every
1:27:31
time So we did that for years We did that for like I think about three years
1:27:36
or so every single week And all through that we were getting smaller and
1:27:41
smaller And um one time even there was only the sound guy there that we hired
1:27:47
cuz none of us knew how to do anything with sound So we'd hire a sound guy and there would be one to four people
1:27:54
there One time it was just the sound guy So we did the worship night just just
1:27:59
for the sound guy and had the live stream going with just a couple people watching if that and that was it But we
1:28:06
set all we did all of that work loading everything The six hours of loading
1:28:13
everything for one person that we hired to be
1:28:22
there And we would put down chairs like this and we would put down like 30 of
1:28:29
them every single week And we never filled even half of them We got kept
1:28:34
getting smaller And I would do it most weeks I would put down the actual chairs for years and then go up and play the
1:28:40
piano and lead worship and then preach Yes This was the small beginnings that I
1:28:48
went through You see and so and then after that when COVID hit we
1:28:55
then went outside and then we decreased even more So many times it was just Jean Tall and I And so now we didn't have the
1:29:02
whole rigging system cuz we're out in the park But now we loaded everything in my car We actually kept everything in my
1:29:09
car I think And then we'd have a wagon We put everything on the wagon all the equipment on the wagon And sometimes
1:29:14
remember it was 100 degree weather Jean Paul and I are sweating so much We're we're rolling it down the grassy hill
1:29:20
and things would fall off several times and we have to put him back on And we make so many trips And for many many
1:29:27
many months about more than a year at Pam Pacific Park Jean Tall and I did the entire setup setting up when revival
1:29:33
broke out We did the entire setup when 300 people showed up and revival broke out and it became a global revival We
1:29:40
were still doing the setup even for I think a few weeks later Um and so yeah and so you know it
1:29:49
was funny like when revival broke out I I think some people were like what she came out of nowhere you
1:29:55
know it was just like overnight or like overnight success There's no such thing as overnight
1:30:01
success You know it was years of small beginning of
1:30:08
feeling like you're going backwards Years of planning and planning and planning and not seeing a sprout come
1:30:14
out and feeling like you're going backwards Like what happened to the seeds we planted is how I would feel you
1:30:21
know but God wanted me to go through that God wanted us to go through
1:30:27
that for two reasons One to mold our
1:30:32
character to mold us to be more like Jesus We have to go through this fire to
1:30:38
be more like Jesus It's the only way to go through that waiting is the
1:30:43
only thing that produces patience So if you see someone that's so
1:30:50
Christlike they're so patient with somebody and you're like "How can they be that patient?" It's because of years
1:30:57
of your patience being tested and saying "Yes Lord I'll allow
1:31:02
you to test my patience I'll I'll choose to be content and go through this waiting season which
1:31:09
is really uncomfortable but I will choose to be content I will choose to not complain I will choose to keep
1:31:15
praising you and thanking you I will choose to keep on serving you every day Even though I don't like waiting nobody
1:31:21
likes waiting That's where the patience comes
1:31:27
from That's where the Christlikeness comes from The small beginnings the years sometimes
1:31:35
of small beginnings This is one of the reasons why God says "Do not despise small
1:31:41
beginnings for he loves to see the work begin." He loves to see the work begin of the refining fire that transforms you
1:31:46
more into his image to get you to the place where people can encounter him through you so
1:31:53
powerfully because your character is made so much into his his likeness
1:32:00
Hallelujah Hallelujah Praise God And he tests your faithfulness He tests if he can count on
1:32:07
you If you will keep showing up for him If you will keep obeying him Are you really serving him to serve him or are
1:32:13
you serving him for your own gain this is how it's tested When you
1:32:21
serve him for years and you don't get any kind of benefit from it you don't get any kind of applause from
1:32:28
it This is how he tests that And this is how that character is made in you
1:32:35
more where you lose your you die to yourself You die to your ambitions
1:32:41
So these small beginnings are beautiful because God does this great work in this
1:32:47
place Hallelujah He can't do that work when you're sitting on your butt waiting to be called to serve
1:32:55
somewhere He can't do that work there All right He does it when you start
1:33:00
serving him in these little things these simple things mundane things and you
1:33:06
keep serving him for a long time for years and you stay in small beginnings
1:33:11
and and and and allow him to do this work instead of complaining that you're not
1:33:17
growing or complaining that it's taking too long Amen
1:33:23
Hallelujah Hallelujah So this this is one of the big reasons
1:33:31
why this God does these small beginnings Why God made this small beginning in my life last so long was this was his big
1:33:39
refining fire for my life This is the biggest place that I was transformed and
1:33:44
I continue to be transformed every day Glory to God But like the biggest work came through came through this time
1:33:52
He needed me to be ready to be a shepherd of many people to not be halfway ready He had to do a big work
1:33:59
that took years So those small beginnings were
1:34:04
perfect beautiful Don't despise them They're beautiful They're perfect They're
1:34:11
ordained orchestrated perfectly by God Hallelujah The second reason that
1:34:19
God does small beginnings and and allows you to stay in it for a little while for
1:34:24
a while long while sometimes is
1:34:31
because God is building this big testimony in your life
1:34:38
Testimony of his faithfulness Testimony of what happens when you don't give up When you keep
1:34:44
believing God and you keep serving him he's he's building you out to be a modern-day Bible character who had who
1:34:52
has great faith who can be an example for other
1:34:59
people In my small beginnings one of the small beginning times that I didn't mention to you yet is that well many of
1:35:06
you have heard the story already but um some of you haven't um about four years more than four year
1:35:14
four years and some months after I started ministering so now four and a half years of feeling like it's going
1:35:20
backwards small beginning season for four and a half years almost I was
1:35:25
ministering in the park and there was one person sitting there on a 100 degree
1:35:31
something day and I was preaching to the one person and we had live stream going which would just have a couple people if
1:35:36
that at that time and as I was in the middle of preaching she gets up and leaves So then I shift to looking at the
1:35:44
live stream and I didn't know if even anyone was watching but I didn't give up and I kept preaching I finished the
1:35:50
message and um the Lord was reminding me of this
1:35:56
moment last night and I I see it with so much of a different perspective than I do back then When that happened all I
1:36:02
could think was this is hard It's been years of this It's like we're going
1:36:09
backwards This is hard but I love you God and I'll keep obeying
1:36:15
you That was like my mind at that
1:36:20
time But today I see it so differently Today I see I see that God
1:36:28
orchestrated this moment for me to share this story in the future that would
1:36:33
encourage thousands or maybe even millions of people and that when they heard this testimony it would lead to
1:36:40
them not giving up because they heard that
1:36:45
testimony Hallelujah It would lead them to not
1:36:51
give up on God and depart from the faith It would lead them to not give up on
1:36:57
what God had called them to do so they could be used mightily by God They could be like a David they could keep going
1:37:06
because they heard this testimony of God's faithfulness Hallelujah
1:37:13
And so I look back now and it encourages me today It encourages me right now in
1:37:19
my present tense situation in life I am so encouraged that even my life today God
1:37:26
is still building a testimony that's going to encourage thousands millions
1:37:32
more in a deeper even way than my testimony thus
1:37:40
far Hallelujah Hallelujah It helps me because so often
1:37:46
we're just like why God god isn't this enough god can you bring the reward yet can you
1:37:53
bring the increase yet can we increase at least a little bit lord what God can
1:37:59
some of the promises come at least one We I've been going a while It's been a
1:38:05
long time Can I have just one but that's how where we're are That's where we're
1:38:11
at in our minds so much when really God's saying "I'm going to use you to
1:38:18
encourage and lift the faith of thousands of people millions of
1:38:23
people Keep going This isn't about your comfortability This is about the
1:38:29
rescuing of souls in the
1:38:35
future Of course you deserve reward It's coming but it's not yet because this
1:38:41
testimony is going to touch tons of lives Hallelujah And so in this small
1:38:48
beginning that's another reason why God has the small beginning be the way that it is is because God is doing the same
1:38:55
thing in your life that he did in mine He's building a testimony that will lead many people to Jesus That will lead many
1:39:01
people to not give up that will lead many people to see the goodness and the faithfulness of God They will know that
1:39:08
they can trust God They will have the strength and courage to keep going
1:39:13
because of your testimony So it is worth going through the small beginnings Don't
1:39:20
despise the small beginnings We rejoice in the small beginnings God rejoices to
1:39:25
see this work done that's leading to many souls coming to him Hallelujah
1:39:31
[Applause] Hallelujah Thank you
1:39:39
Jesus God's in control Don't you worry about the what the results Don't look at
1:39:45
the results the lack of results Don't look at that one bit because God was in control The anointing was growing in me
1:39:53
this whole time And one day God just decided to turn it on like a light switch and make it flow out of me
1:40:00
and demons started manifesting and leaving people And that did not happen all those four and a half years of
1:40:07
ministering weekly bi-weekly two week two times a week sometimes Sometimes I would go live every single day of the
1:40:14
week during COVID times Not one time did a demon manifest and leave somebody until four and a half years It was God's
1:40:20
God was in control God was in control of the harvest God was in control of the
1:40:26
increase And so he waited and he waited for that
1:40:31
perfect moment when he would unleash the anointing and when the harvest would come And overnight revival was breaking
1:40:39
out all over the world through the screen going all over the world
1:40:45
People traveled from nations different nations every single week since that year 2021
1:40:53
just just months after the one person left when I was preaching to her is when
1:40:58
300 showed up at the park and it was overflowing in the amphitheater and hundreds every day since then and people
1:41:04
traveled internationally every single week since then So don't worry about what you're
1:41:09
seeing God's doing it on purpose This is the testimony This is
1:41:14
the test that will turn into a testimony It's your test that will turn into a
1:41:21
testimony to bless many people
1:41:26
Hallelujah Praise God Galatians 6:9 Let us not become
1:41:34
weary in doing good For at the proper time God's
1:41:40
time God's perfect time we will reap a harvest if we don't give up
1:41:50
Hallelujah That is a true word I can testify of that in my life I'm so grateful I didn't
1:41:57
give up Hallelujah What kept me from not giving up in those small
1:42:04
beginnings was believing the word of God Was being like a child and believing the
1:42:10
word of God The prophetic word of God over my life The prophetic word directing me
1:42:17
from my spiritual father speaking that revival is now speaking that revival is going to break out The direction that
1:42:22
would come through him in regards to God's plan for my life and ministry and here in LA He prophesied these things
1:42:30
and I like a child believed that they would come to pass the words that the prophet prophesied because God has given
1:42:39
prophets as gifts to the body of Christ for this reason to guide
1:42:45
us to direct us like a child We don't have to worry
1:42:51
We don't have to we don't have to worry trying to figure it out Stress it was like it was easy for me I
1:42:59
just simply believed the prophecy I believed that word I knew that God wasn't a
1:43:05
liar and so I kept doing what the word said I remember the uh prophet Jordan my
1:43:12
spiritual father prophesied I see the way that revival is breaking out in LA and all over the world How people will
1:43:18
start to know about this revival that has God has begun in the spirit is
1:43:23
through one minute videos And so God is telling you to put out one minute videos and keep putting them out like you're
1:43:29
going around the walls of Jericho and eventually the walls will come down Don't stop short And so I took that word
1:43:37
to heart I immediately from that word taught myself how to edit on the um
1:43:45
iMovie used what was in my hand my my laptop the iMovie
1:43:51
program and edited little videos and they got hardly any views for years And
1:43:58
one day this one minute video went viral just as the prophet
1:44:03
prophesied just as what God had spoken And that video going viral it the video
1:44:10
went as the video went viral so many people testified of miracles they received while watching the video And
1:44:16
that never happened on any video I had ever put out before Only one miracle ever had happened Now it's uncountable I
1:44:21
don't know to this day how many miracles happened on that one one minute video And it went virus on my 30th
1:44:28
birthday January 1st That was like a wink from God and a great confirmation and a great gift and a great
1:44:34
reward Hallelujah And that is what led to
1:44:39
revival breaking out That is what led to word spreading and eventually more and more people coming up until March when
1:44:46
the first demon was cast out of a person of a woman And then that video went viral And so the word happened just as
1:44:53
it was spoken So I was able to endure the small beginnings and not give up because I
1:45:00
like a child believed the word of God and was obedient to the word of God The direction the very simple direction
1:45:10
So that's God's direction for you now Don't try to do your own
1:45:17
thing Do what God has spoken Where you are planted do what God has
1:45:23
spoken If you don't have a per personal direct prophecy like I had you have all
1:45:29
you need right now This is the prophetic anointing I spent the beginning part of this message teaching you how you can
1:45:35
serve God Revival is now People need to hear and
1:45:41
know and see that revival is now and encounter this revival Encounter Jesus
1:45:46
So you have all you need to do it The prophetic word has been given to you many times I've repeated it again and
1:45:52
again Amen So you have all you need Focus on that Don't get distracted with
1:45:58
doing other things that God's not asking you to do He's a God of order and simplicity
1:46:04
Amen Hallelujah Praise
1:46:13
God And the last so so so so so the first thing I want to share you with giving you wisdom in serving God is to
1:46:20
be be aware of the enemy's schemes to try to stop you He he will try to stop you with thoughts of insecurity like
1:46:26
you're not good enough and that what you're doing doesn't matter
1:46:32
You see in my story how the enemy could have played that so hard and he
1:46:39
did You're not a very good preacher You see people aren't even coming back and it's getting
1:46:45
smaller This isn't working He definitely spoke that many times but I ignored him
1:46:51
and I rejected him and I just kept believing the word like a child and kept doing what God called me to do
1:46:58
And you may see me as like a good preacher now but I did not feel like a good preacher for those four years
1:47:04
during that small beginning Not one time did I feel I mean pretty much not one time did I feel like
1:47:11
a good adequate preacher So don't listen to your
1:47:17
feelings The devil's lying through them many times Amen
1:47:23
Your weakness is powerful because that's where God's power and glory is revealed the most when you give it to him and
1:47:31
allow him to use it Hallelujah So that's the big one in your
1:47:37
wisdom to know the devil's scheme to try to stop you by bringing these thoughts of insecurity But the second thing I
1:47:44
want to share with you in wisdom in serving God um so that the enemy never has an inch and you can always keep
1:47:52
being powerful serving him Hallelujah Um okay The bigger the army
1:48:00
the more the devil's kingdom is crushed The bigger the revival army the more the
1:48:06
devil's kingdom is crushed Okay
1:48:13
So there's power in numbers
1:48:19
What I mean by that is it doesn't matter what kind of small job you think you're
1:48:25
doing It's massive It's powerful When you're serving
1:48:32
God putting down chairs is no small thing I put down chairs for many years
1:48:39
that many people didn't even sit in Now you're preparing the space for people to receive the anointing They've fallen
1:48:46
back in their chairs for God to meet them in their chairs
1:48:53
Hallelujah Like whatever you're doing to serve God in this work in this move is
1:48:59
big You are seen as a warrior not a bystander a warrior who carries power
1:49:06
over the enemy to crush his kingdom So I say that to
1:49:12
say you need to be aware that the enemy wants to stop you from serving and he
1:49:19
wants to find an open door through a warrior to try to attack the work of
1:49:25
God to try to attack the servants of God
1:49:31
leaders So it's not just the Don't think that it's just me that the enemy might
1:49:37
might want to try to attack No you got to be aware
1:49:44
yourself You got to be aware Now you have victory over the enemy But you have to be aware only when you are aware and
1:49:52
only when you have decided I will not give the devil an inch I will not open
1:49:58
any kind of door to the enemy I will serve God every day with excellence with
1:50:04
humility with a servant heart You need to make that intention every
1:50:10
day And if you start to have other thoughts and feelings cropping up of pride of jealousy of other
1:50:17
motives when it comes to serving God catch yourself Watch yourself The enemy
1:50:24
is looking He's looking to find an open door to attack the army to attack the
1:50:30
work of God And this doesn't this doesn't always
1:50:35
mean like a Judas like a betrayal or a persecution I don't mean just that It
1:50:40
can mean that for sure For sure That's what happened with Judas That was an open door that he that he chose to allow
1:50:48
the devil to use him I don't mean just that though I mean
1:50:54
even a way to attack the the the
1:50:59
preciousness and the purity and the joy and the order and the unity of the army
1:51:06
and the work You see if you're serving in the work of God here here in this
1:51:11
place or online it's so important that we're all united that we all have pure hearts that we all have servant hearts
1:51:18
that we are all putting others before ourselves that we have all died to our egos and selfish ambition It's so
1:51:26
important because if there's an open door there in some way the enemy can penetrate through that door and bring an
1:51:33
attack for the whole work of God or even bring an attack to leadership
1:51:40
So it's so important for you to be aware of this to know the powerful thing you
1:51:45
are doing when you serve God that it's not something to take lightly but to
1:51:51
really take it seriously to to to to see that the purity of your heart because
1:51:56
many times many times I talked about this a little bit last Sunday we need to grow we need to keep growing we need to
1:52:03
be aware of an area where we're not growing and we need to make change we need to make intention
1:52:09
But the thing is is people can tend to be lazy in this area Uh I don't feel like attending to that
1:52:15
yet Yeah These negative thoughts these prideful thoughts these selfish thoughts eh I don't need to do anything about
1:52:21
them yet People can think that way I'll get to that later You know they're thinking that
1:52:27
it's just having to do with their own spiritual health but when you're serving God it's
1:52:33
affecting the whole army So it's so important you realize this
1:52:39
like serving what I'm doing in this revival army is so serious and I want to make sure I'm
1:52:46
pleasing God always but not just like my own personal relationship with God that
1:52:52
I'm pleasing him but like I care about this work I care about this army
1:53:00
I don't want to harm this army I don't want to open a door for the army to be
1:53:05
harmed for anything to take away from the work of God Because when you see the seriousness
1:53:11
of what you're doing the honor of what you're doing in serving God that gives
1:53:16
you more strength and motivation to be serious about keeping every door
1:53:23
shut Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah Praise God
1:53:32
1 Peter 5:8 "Be alert and of sober mind Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to
1:53:38
devour Resist him standing firm in the faith because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is
1:53:45
undergoing the same kind of sufferings Be alert Be of sober mind." He's looking
1:53:52
for an open door He's looking how to make the army not as strong because he
1:53:59
knows the power is in numbers The more he will be defeated the bigger our army
1:54:05
is All right be aware Resist him standing firm in the faith You are not
1:54:11
alone We are all warriors fighting the good fight of faith and we can do it
1:54:17
together Hallelujah We have victory as we stand together Hallelujah
1:54:24
Hallelujah Thank you Jesus And I lastly just want to share
1:54:30
um a couple testimonies A couple testimonies One I meant to share in the beginning but
1:54:37
let's share it right now Um was it last uh two weeks ago I think
1:54:43
it was There was a a mother and son here from Germany I think it was two weeks
1:54:48
ago Maybe it's three weeks I think it's two weeks Do we have the picture yeah So I posted this on social media So a lot
1:54:53
of you might have seen it but I know some of you didn't But it is so powerful So on Easter resurrection Sunday this
1:55:00
mom and son came to a rise and shine conference They came the next day um on Easter resurrection Sunday They were
1:55:06
think they were standing right here and God delivered them It let Oh we don't have the Okay there's a picture where
1:55:12
they're they were standing with a picture It was a picture of a family member but they were standing with a p
1:55:19
and he he had written down what he was renouncing renouncing lust And so he had struggled with several years of a it was
1:55:26
porn addiction right pornography addiction And he tried so hard to stop
1:55:32
it and he cried an hour one time straight because it grieved him how he could not stop it And God delivered him
1:55:39
on that day completely set free Hallelujah No desire to do that anymore
1:55:46
And he was so overjoyed Hallelujah And then his mom um she was set free
1:55:53
from bipolar disorder on that same day as well Hallelujah So the following Sunday which
1:56:00
is like a couple weeks ago they came and testified of this And then the
1:56:05
father/husband from Germany who didn't come there in person but he testified this powerful testimony I wanted to
1:56:12
share this with you Yesterday you posted a video from my wife and my son from Germany As a husband and father that was
1:56:18
the moment that changed my life The fact that my wife was freed from 25 years of bipolar disorder is an absolute miracle
1:56:26
We literally went we literally went through hell together but I also had my share of burdens Half a year ago when I
1:56:32
read Katherine's first book The Secret of the Anointing I was freed from pornography Now when God through
1:56:38
Katherine broke the generational curse on my son I was also freed from the
1:56:43
compulsion to masturbate Praise God And he was all the way in
1:56:49
Germany when that took place Since I was seven years old so for 50 years I was trapped by this
1:56:57
generational curse Jesus which also affected my father I
1:57:04
tried everything to get away from it Condemnation shame and self- accusation were my constant companions accompanied
1:57:10
by constant failure But now I am truly free since God through Katherine broke
1:57:16
this curse through the anointing Every day I wake up with joy and can hardly believe what has happened And I know there are many men
1:57:23
and boys out there driven by this addiction I can tell you yes there is deliverance when you come under the
1:57:28
anointing Praise God Hallelujah
1:57:37
Hallelujah Wow Wow And I just noticed now that he said it was through my first book that God delivered him from from
1:57:44
pornography Praise God So speaking actually of the book I wanted to share
1:57:51
another testimony because how God is using you all to spread this revival is
1:57:56
so powerful I I hope you're getting the revelation of the power you have the power God's given you of the truth that
1:58:03

1:59:51
Um this is Rue who's in Toronto I brought one book from my car in my bag
1:59:57
and I didn't know who I was going to give it to I get on my floor at the hospital cuz this is where she works And
2:00:04
one of my nursing colleagues from another unit decided to pick up overtime on my unit As I saw her coming down the
2:00:10
hallway we greeted each other and she said "I don't know why I agreed to do overtime I missed out on my yoga class I
2:00:18
kept quiet and then a few minutes later she randomly asks me if I go to a
2:00:24
specific church I replied no Then she asks where I attend church and I said 5F
2:00:30
Church based in Los Angeles Then I went into my bag to pull out an invitation to Revival is now Toronto And I also pulled
2:00:36
out the book She opened it up randomly to chapter 8 page 106 which talks about
2:00:42
yoga
2:00:49
which talks about yoga as a counterfeit to being yolked with Jesus She was so
2:00:55
shocked she began to read it out loud As she read she became increasingly astonished that she was just talking
2:01:01
about missing her yoga class to now reading that yoga was demonic We both knew this was a divine appointment and
2:01:08
that Jesus wanted her to know how much he loved her Hallelujah
2:01:14
[Applause] So this isn't that amazing I mean divine
2:01:21
encounter de I mean that that is no coincidence right that is
2:01:27
Jesus This is what Jesus is doing right now He he's setting up these divine
2:01:32
appointments He's pursuing people He's setting it up where all we have to do is be obedient You know Ru is just like I
2:01:38
was quiet for a few minutes I pulled out my book Very simple
2:01:44
Ah and this is just one of many I'm seeing these every day happening I share
2:01:51
this for you to know the exciting work the important work that God is calling
2:01:58
you to do right now He's set up these divine appointments
2:02:04
I'm telling you he set them up for you They're ready to go And your part is
2:02:09
very simple takes a little bit of boldness but that you got the fire of the Holy Spirit to give you that boldness and you're going to receive
2:02:15
more today Hallelujah So get out there and be about your
2:02:22
father's business Get out there and spread this good news
2:02:28
even harder even farther and wider Amen
2:02:33
Keep spreading the book and shining your light army of God

2:03:53
greatly needed right now Greatly needed so that we can do more for God Greatly
2:03:58
needed because God is taking us higher It's so beautiful the small beginnings after God opened the doors to the
2:04:05
harvest it kept increasing I was thinking today I was looking back and how look at the worship band that is
2:04:11
here now that God has provided For years I was just playing on
2:04:16
the piano not very well just me and Jean Tal For for years it was just John Tall
2:04:23
filming We were in the the white building with a hilarious setup with
2:04:29
live stream carrying the laptop cuz we were just using what was in our hands and we didn't know what else to do We
2:04:36
didn't have the finances yet to to be able to have this live stream that we have now God has been faithful to take
2:04:42
us glory to glory to glory It wasn't until last year that we were hosting our own events regularly like monthly And
2:04:50
now God has brought us to that but he's he's taking us higher and higher But we got to step up to the plate and do more
2:04:57
We got to be ready to serve more and to contribute more Amen So I want I want to invite every one of you because there is
2:05:03
this new level this new level financially God is taking us to this year where it's even more events It's
2:05:10
more more events even than last year with the conferences that God has
2:05:15
planned There is more of a need in this area because of this higher standard
2:05:21
that God's taking us to reach more and more people So I encourage you to to s
2:05:27
to give more to contribute more in this area because there is a need It's because there's a need because God is
2:05:34

2:05:39

2:05:44
important to not look at something and see like maybe you don't see the need Maybe you don't see the need It you
2:05:53
know and sometimes we're pulled on our hearts more when you like see a need But
2:05:58
I'm telling you if if we didn't have people giving we couldn't be here every week Amen And still it's in faith even
2:06:06
for this week in Toronto It's in faith that God is going to provide Amen
2:06:12
Believing people will because we're making it free events That's why I'm saying this year is different from last
2:06:18
year because they weren't free events last year Now God is calling us to do free events So so it doesn't hold back
2:06:25
anyone from coming But that requires more faith on our part and it requires more giving on your
2:06:31
part because it's all on us All on 5F
