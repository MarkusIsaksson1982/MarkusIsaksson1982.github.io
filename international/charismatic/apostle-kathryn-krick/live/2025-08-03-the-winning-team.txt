Sweden, where God moved so powerfully
35:48
at Revival is now Stockholm, Sweden. Wow. It was truly one of the most
35:54
powerful moves of God I've ever witnessed, been a part of. And I'm still
35:59
in awe of what Jesus has done. I was looking at pictures. I, you know, traveling. I I I I my flight was at 8 in
36:07
8 something in the morning um on Saturday after getting back at midnight to the hotel after ministering. So
36:15
that's it's a long journey back, you know, and it's evening time last night. I see the pictures, some of the pictures
36:22
of the event. And I am just filled with energy and joy. Just the Holy Spirit
36:29
moving through these pictures, just seeing God touch his people. God moved
36:35
so powerfully. People came so hungry. They ran through the doors as soon as
36:42
the doors were opened up. So hungry to encounter God. People came from about 25
36:47
nations, maybe more, to encounter Jesus at Revival Now Stockholm. Hallelujah.
36:54
And God moved so powerfully. He did so many miracles. He set free so many. He
37:01
brought healing for so many. And um also a powerful powerful word. God has God
37:08
spoke that it's time for revival in Stockholm. He has chosen this nation to
37:15
be a place of revival that will influence Europe. Hallelujah. And this
37:21
revi revival has taken place in the past in Sweden, but it had grown cold. And
37:26
now it's time for revival to begin again and be greater than the latter day than

the la than the the past days. Hallelujah. So, hallelujah. It was such
37:39
an atmosphere of joy and excitement for God's plans for Sweden and for what he

did. He moved so mightily and I'm so in awe. We have a little video showing some of what he did. So, we're going to watch
37:51
that video right now.

38:03
death, all must go now in Jesus name. Be
38:10
free. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
38:15
Revival has been here in Sweden in the past, but over time it has grown cold.
38:24
But now God is bringing revival, days of revival
38:31
back to Sweden. Every time she tries to move forward,
38:37
this demonic spirit holds her back. I declare all of you, every spirit of lack
38:42
must leave her in Jesus name. The time is now for revival in Sweden. This is

40:33
that so many people were healed and freed and encountered Jesus. It's a huge thing you did. Even if you contributed a
40:39
little bit is a huge thing that you did. Amen. So, thank you so much and I bless
40:45
you. Hallelujah. May you experience this great joy of seeing people freed and
40:50
healed and delivered thanks to what you have done being vessels of God. Amen.
40:56
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Well, I want to um welcome everyone this
41:04
week who has become part of Fivefold Church, the Fivefold Church family, who's become planted at 5F Church from
41:09
around the world. We have people planted from 162 nations around the world that
41:15
join us every Sunday that join us live. And so this week we are welcoming 156
41:21
new 5F family members. We have a new territory this week of Palestine. Wow.
41:28
Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
41:34
Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah.
41:41
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. This revival is reaching the ends of the earth. Every
41:49
nation shall know our Jesus. Our Jesus who moves in power, who saves, heals,
41:55
and delivers. Hallelujah. So, these are where all of our 156 new five family
42:01
members that joined us this week are from. All of these states and all of these nations and territories. Glory to
42:07
God. Welcome to the family. If that is you, as you become planted, you will be
42:13
so blessed and flourish and walk in abundant life. So, I'm so excited for
42:19
you. You, we are also excited for this abundant life that you will experience as you plant yourself in a true church
42:27
where God is moving in power. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I also just want to
42:34
share going back to the Sweden event just to just to share a little more praise report about what God did in
42:40
Sweden. Um I it's it's like every time I minister
42:45
now at a different city or nation where we have a small group, it's it's it's an
42:52
even greater joy because you can see this growth of what God is doing. And
42:58
you can see, you know, that as as I go to minister, as we have these events, Revival is now events and conferences in
43:04
different cities and nations, it's not just a one-time event. It's not just a one-time moment for people to receive
43:11
and then they go back to life as usual. But we are paving the way for revival to
43:19
be in that city, in that nation. this apostolic work of the body of
43:26
Christ in that city, in that nation, to be experiencing revival and to be having
43:31
the power of God in the church and a place where people can come and receive from in person, not just online. Amen.
43:39
And so, um, you know, in Sweden, we have a small group in Sweden. And there are
43:45
members of our 5F church family who've been planted for years. Miriam is one of
43:51
them who's a who's a 5F church small group leader along with Daniel. But Miriam, I remember um she came to the
43:59
first Revival Now event in Europe and I distinctly remember watching the testimonies. I would go through and
44:04
watch every testimony and edit them. And I remember seeing her testimony and being just touched by her testimony, how
44:11
God touched her. and she I think she's been to maybe probably I think every single if not most or every single
44:17
Europe Revival Now event. And so it was just so amazing to see four years later
44:23
um she shared her testimony along with our other 5F church family who have been
44:29
planted at 5F church for years. They shared their testimonies of how God has
44:35
delivered them, healed them, saved them, transformed their lives. Hallelujah.
44:40
Um, we have a picture, the other picture, not this picture. There's another one. Um, yes, here we go. So,
44:47
this is our 5F church family in Sweden, some of them who have been planted for years, and they first shared their
44:52
testimonies. Um, and it was so powerful just to see how as we keep sewing seeds
45:01
in this revival, as we keep sewing seeds, there's true amazing growth that is has taken place and will continue to
45:08
happen. you know that people are being equipped in other nations to carry this
45:13
revival truly carry this revival in their nations. Amen. And then now we can put the other
45:19
picture. Um also I was so blessed to meet with the Sweden small group, 5F church small
45:25
group and Finland small group and Sw uh Norway small group. Amen.
45:32
Hallelujah. This is our 5F this is some of our 5F church family.
45:38
These were those those from Finland and Norway are those who traveled and Sweden who traveled to Stockholm and our
45:43
family's even bigger in all of these places, but these are all who were able to travel to Stockholm. And so what joy
45:49
it was to see in person and bless all of our 5F Church family in Scandinavia and
45:55
the Nordic. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. Glory to God.
46:06
All right. Um, we have some testimonies from some of you that I want we're gonna
46:13
have them share with everyone and bless us all. Amen. With their testimonies.

47:47
gotten so strong and um, I just want to renounce
47:52

49:13
Um, Daniela. Daniela. Yes. Can you come to the stage?
49:25
Hi. Would you like to share your testimony? Yes. Um, this is my fourth time here in
49:34
5F. H. I've been planted planted since 2022. And every year that I come is a
49:41
miracle. So I have a bunch of miracles. First time I came to Delician Park and
49:48
um I received impartation of anointing. I realized that after one month that God
49:54
used me to deliver my husband and he didn't believe um he was like there
50:01
there must be a God or something but he didn't believe in all this. He thought this was fake. But he manifested in my
50:10
home. He fall back with the power of God and he testified that since that time
50:17
his life is changed. Now
50:22
before that he for one year he wouldn't h find a job a good job. after the
50:29
deliverance that happened to him, he found a job and he got promoted in that
50:34
job. Also,
50:40
I I was free also after Elician Park. I was free from infirmity. I used to get
50:46
sick very often and I felt like a bladder infection and on this area very
50:54
discomfort. I used to go doctor to doctor, hospital to hospital and since
51:00
2022 nothing of that for me
51:06
also that happened the first time I went.
51:13
Then the second time I went in the stage to testify and I started to shake and
51:20
fall back with the power of God. And on that year you gave the word um the
51:28
promise will be fulfilled and um I was waiting for many years to sponsor my my
51:34
my dad, my mom and my grandma to live in Canada. The beginning I thought we
51:39
barely will make it for one the day that we make it to sponsor. that year that
51:45
you gave the word I we were able to expo sponsor three of
51:51
them not just one also I got praise God also um I got the
52:01
job that I was waiting that year I I was waiting also for many years to move my
52:07
son to a Christian school but we didn't do it because my husband didn't believe right that year we were able to move him
52:14
to the Christian school. And then um the next year that we came, I came again to
52:23
testify last year because we come every year at this time. We I bring my son for
52:29
his birthday to the first time we came he was turning nine. Now he just turned
52:34
11 and um that because of gen generational curses um he was fighting
52:43
lustful thoughts uh that will attack his mind and body and after the last time
52:49
you prayed for him um after some months
52:55
all completely stuff stop and um two weeks before coming here the the
53:02
thoughts the attacking thoughts came back, but he knows he's rejecting them. We watch you.
53:10
We watch all your teachings every night. He says, "We are planted here. Apostle
53:16
Katherine is my spiritual mother." And um yes, also last time I was here, you
53:24
said um everything that that is attacking to this family, God gone. And
53:30
my husband still needs deliverance. He um flies here with us to LA. He he wants
53:38
us to come. He believes in this because every time I come h something happened
53:43
to our lives, but he has he he hasn't been he I know is um oppression. He
53:50
hasn't been able to come in. He waits for us in the hotel. But um that time
53:57
after that time you prayed for us before my husband for some certain seasons he
54:04
will drink drink drink and then now he that that's not happening anymore. He
54:10
even says is because of of this. Um
54:16
yeah. Um also when I came in 2022 the the reason I came at the first time was
54:24
because of marriage was very bad and I was also getting a very sick. I remember
54:30
one of my co-workers said to me, I wish you will be more I wish you happiness
54:36
day because I was also every time crying because of that. And since 2022, our
54:43
marriage wow is a is an imp is so
54:49
impressive for me. He restore God restores our heart. He put um
54:56
love between us is like in a miraculous way. before that we used to try to go
55:03
and I brought him for kind of counselings with pastors of everything but nothing but since I'm here or
55:12
marriage it's just my miracle I cannot describe the different way
55:21
and um also um for your teachings um because my my
55:29
son also pray My son also is praying for my husband to come here because he he my my son knows
55:36
all the principles here. He tells my husband you should come and be free. I tell because of your teachings. I tell
55:42
my my son um this is our promise and we are just going to enjoy the way to that
55:49
promise and believe and he he knows that and also another miracle in arise and
55:56

56:04

56:10
and um erh on that was on Saturday. Uh I
56:15
saw on the rise and shine. I wasn't here but I saw it. And then on that Tuesday,
56:21
the next week when he uh went back to work, he got promoted. He couldn't
56:27
believe it. He didn't apply or anything. He just arrived there and um and was
56:33
promoted. Yeah. So yeah. Uh, I have more miracles, but
56:42
those are the the the the main ones. Praise God.
56:49
Hallelujah. Miracle upon miracle. Wow.
56:55
Wow. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. And I
57:00
declare that any everything that has been holding back your husband from coming, every spirit, every lie, every
57:09
curse, every bondage must be broken now in Jesus' name. I declare nothing to
57:15
hold him back anymore from joining you to come to church and be planted fully
57:22
in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
57:28
I love you. Glory to God. Wow. That's the power of
57:35
being planted where God's power is. You see how important it is to be planted that even even even family members who
57:42
aren't surrendered to God can be blessed because they're receiving the anointing
57:48
flowing through you. Wow. And God uses that as seeds. God
57:55
uses that as a way to pursue them to open their eyes so that they can come and seek him and encounter his love.
58:02
Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. Wow. Jesus.
58:12
Okay. Now, we have pastors from We have pastors from Texas, Ron and Courtney.
58:28
Hallelujah. Praise God. Welcome. So, I hear you both
58:37
have testimonies. Yes. Yeah. In April, I had I've had endometriosis and the pain was so um
58:46
intense that I couldn't walk for for a few days. And so I was taking all these medications and I watched one of your
58:54
live streams and you declared healing and I was instantly healed. Um all the pain just melted away and I had never
59:02
experienced a healing like that before. Um but Jesus touched me and healed me. So yeah, I'm excited. Praise God.
59:09
Hallelujah. Wow. And you have a testimony?
59:15
I was watching your tape and I lost my wife in 2001
59:22
and I was really plagued by depression and grief and I felt it just lift off
59:30
just by watching and I began to cry and it it totally released off
59:39
and I'm totally free now. Praise God. Hallelujah.
59:46
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Wow. And you're both pastors. Is that right?
59:51
Yes. We came to receive impartation. We flew in from Texas yesterday and we're leaving tonight. So, we came in.
59:58
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. God is going to release this. I was going to
1:00:04
say even in it's it's kind of crazy because Pastor Ron hasn't traveled in about 20 years and so all of his
1:00:11
identification to board the flight was uh expired which we didn't know until we got to the security checkpoint. Somehow
1:00:18
his boarding pass uh printed out TSA pre-check which is really difficult to
1:00:23
get. You have to go through like a process to get it. and his boarding pass printed out TSA pre-check and just you
1:00:30
know I um everywhere I've traveled a lot all around the world and it's so
1:00:36
different to travel with favor. Every person that's been our Uber driver has been a Christian. We met a man from
1:00:42
Armenia who had a vision of Jesus revealing himself to him. Um we met a
1:00:48
man who uh who had like lost he missed his flight or something like that. And
1:00:53
so we just got to minister to him and pray with him. And it's just so different to travel with favor. And so God God made a way. So we're here. We're
1:01:01
excited. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So what made you want to
1:01:07
come to travel all this way to to receive? I wanted to receive the anointing that
1:01:14
you have in your life for deliverance, for the people I minister to.
1:01:19
Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. and you. I'm so hungry for all of Jesus. So, I
1:01:25
want I want anything that he that he has. I want all of him in my life. Amen.
1:01:31
Hallelujah. Praise God. God is releasing his anointing upon you all right now
1:01:37
because you have hearts that he can trust. You have pure hearts. Thank you, Jesus. I release this anointing upon you
1:01:44
now. May God use you in power as you minister to people. May miracles take
1:01:50
place. May the captives be set free and may revival spread through you in Texas in Jesus' name. I release this anointing
1:01:58
upon you and may God use you mightily to those you minister to. May they receive
1:02:03
miracles. May they be set free. May their eyes open up and may revival
1:02:08
spread through you in Jesus' name. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:02:16
Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. Thank you,
1:02:22
Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Wow.
1:02:28
Wow. Nothing can stop you from receiving from God. There will be supernatural favor
1:02:36
upon you that doesn't make sense to get you to where God needs you to be under
1:02:42
the shadow of the anointing to receive miracles, to receive impartation.
1:02:48
Hallelujah. Wow. Praise God. [Applause]
1:02:57
I'm in awe. I travel all the time. I just know what a miracle that is. Jesus.
1:03:04
Wow. Wow. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you,
1:03:10
Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Wow. Well, we're gonna get into the word
1:03:15
of God right now. And I'm titling this message today the winning team.
1:03:21
Hallelujah. I'm going to be I'm going to be sharing about being on the winning team, which is on God's team.
1:03:29
When you're on the winning team, you were on God's side. And I'm going to be
1:03:35
sharing what it's like to be on the winning team. On God's side, and how to
1:03:40
get there, how to be on the winning team. Amen. Hallelujah.
1:03:49
Okay. So I want to first talk about I first want to talk about different kinds
1:03:54
different types of Christians in the body of Christ today.
1:04:00
There are different types of Christians. There should only be one type of Christian
1:04:05
and that is one who is fully surrendered to Jesus and is really aligning themselves with
1:04:14
God's principles with God's way you know not surrendering your own way like
1:04:20
surrendering to God according to religion according to religious doctrine
1:04:27
what what you think is the right way to surrender
1:04:32
but humbling yourself so that God can open up your eyes to see what really
1:04:39
surrender means to see what really laying your d laying
1:04:44
your life down and becoming a disciple looks like. Cuz you have to seek God to
1:04:50
find him. You have to seek him with all of your heart in order for your eyes to
1:04:57
open up to see really what God means in his word. the true revelation of his
1:05:03
word. Amen. So the first so so so one type of Christian that we see today are lukewarm
1:05:11
lukewarm Christians. Lukewarm Christians and we get this word from how it says in
1:05:16
revelation God says because you are not hot or cold
1:05:22
you are lukewarm I will spit you out. So the word lukewarm means not on fire not
1:05:28
surrendered. It means living a double life. It means living the Christian way
1:05:35
sometimes but living your way other times. A lukewarm Christian has doors
1:05:41
open up to the devil. They've given a foothold to the devil in certain areas of their life. So when when a person is
1:05:49
lukewarm, not only is this not pleasing to God,
1:05:54
not only is this a path where it's not certain if you'll go to heaven, that's
1:06:01
the narrow road where we can have confidence of where we're going when we are surrendered and walking on the
1:06:07
narrow road. Amen. So, not only is it that you don't have that certainty, and
1:06:12
that's a dangerous place to be, but also when you're when a person is a lukewarm
1:06:18
Christian, they are giving the devil access to them. They are opening up
1:06:23
doors to the enemy. And what that looks like is giving authority to the enemy
1:06:28
for him to have his way in their life. When you surrender to God, you are
1:06:35
closing doors to the devil. You are not giving the devil access. You are saying no to temptations. You are saying no to
1:06:42
the devil's lies. You are saying no to the devil's portion that he's trying to inflict on your life. And you are
1:06:49
instead saying yes fully to God. You are saying yes to believing in God and
1:06:55
believing in his word. You are saying yes to in his word where it says by his stripes we are healed. So you you are
1:07:03
prescribing yourself subscribing yourself to that doctrine. You're saying this is my truth that I must be healed
1:07:09
that I must be free. I won't accept the devil's portion on my life. I stand on
1:07:15
the word of God. I reject the devil's lies and I will do the necessary to
1:07:21
receive freedom and healing if I need that. Which means surrendering to God.
1:07:26
It means renouncing. It means positioning positioning yourself where God's power is so God's power can come
1:07:32
upon you and deliver you and heal you. And it means being planted so you're receiving a spiritual protection over
1:07:38
your life and also being equipped to have victory over the devil and have
1:07:43
your eyes opened up spiritually so the devil can never deceive you. Amen.
1:07:49
So um that's a surrendered life. So, a lukewarm life is when you're giving
1:07:55
authority to the to the enemy by having these doors opened up. It's like you're agreeing with the enemy's portion on
1:08:02
your life and what he wants for your life in some areas. That's the action of
1:08:08
living lukewarm. It's the action of having those doors opened up. And so
1:08:15
when a person is living a lukewarm Christian life, they are missing out on
1:08:21
the hand of God upon their lives. They are missing out on accessing the
1:08:26
supernatural power of God. They're missing out on the miraculous life that a Christian is intended to have.
1:08:34
They're missing out on abundant life. And the big reason of this is because they are giving access to the enemy. And
1:08:40
you can't have it both ways. You are choosing if that is you, you are
1:08:45
choosing the enemy's portion. You receive abundant life. You receive
1:08:51
miracles. You receive the supernatural life when you stand firmly on God's side. When you surrender to God, that's
1:08:58
when you receive that. Amen. So another type of Christian that we see
1:09:05
is a Christian who has most or all doors shut to the enemy.
1:09:12
They are living on the outside what looks like a great beautiful Christian
1:09:17
life. They're not doing the the sins that we consider, you know, the main
1:09:23
sins like drinking and doing drugs and sleeping around and uh swearing and
1:09:31
living impure sexual lifestyles and all of this and stealing and lying and cheating. They're not doing any of those
1:09:37
things. They're going to church regularly. They're reading the Bible. They're praying. Um and they're treating people with kindness and they're serving
1:09:44
in the church. They're doing all of these things. is they're praying um having relationship with God
1:09:51
but they are not accepting
1:09:57
God's move. They are not accepting revival. They are
1:10:03
not accepting God's anointing. They are not accepting of God doing a new thing.
1:10:08
They want to stay with the status quo. They want to stay in tradition. They
1:10:14
want to stay where it's comfortable. Where most Christians are,
1:10:19
where it's pop, things are popular, where there is no controversy, there's
1:10:24
no drama because of persecution. That's where they want to be. So on the
1:10:31
outside, it looks like they are a great Christian and they are not opening up doors to the
1:10:39
devil. So this type of Christian because they
1:10:45
are not opening up all these doors to the devil for the most part they probably aren't
1:10:52
experiencing any bondage. For the most part they have peace most
1:11:00
of the time. They have Jesus in their hearts, Holy Spirit in their life. They
1:11:07
have a pretty good life. but they're not experiencing the miraculous life.
1:11:15
They have peace and joy, but not abundant peace and abundant joy.
1:11:24
They don't experience this wild favor like the testimonies we
1:11:30
heard. They don't experience that.
1:11:37
So when they share with someone about their life with Christ,
1:11:43
it's like they don't describe any miracles. They just describe how now they have
1:11:49
peace and their life's pretty good and they know where they're going when they
1:11:54
die and they have a friend in Jesus, but there's no testimony of the
1:11:59
miraculous happening. There's no testimony of the mighty hand of God coming upon their lives. and there's not
1:12:06
a lot of fruit in their lives where people are being saved, healed, and delivered as God moves through them.
1:12:15
This is this this is the status of a lot of Christians today. And some of these Christians, by the way, do have bondage.
1:12:21
And that's due to um generational curses or it's due to abuse that maybe occurred
1:12:27
when they were children um or their life before they were a believer. They opened up a lot of doors. So, some of these
1:12:34
believers are in church today and they have all doors shut to the devil, but they have bondage because they need the
1:12:40
anointing to come upon them to destroy the yolks. The anointing is the power of God. The power of God that moves through
1:12:46
vessels. But there's both. Like if we look in if we go in churches today, like many churches today with the where the
1:12:54
anointing is not spoken about and the power of God is not demonstrated like most churches that we see today. You'll
1:13:02
see a big mix of those believers. You'll see lukewarm, but you'll also see people who are serious about living the
1:13:09
Christian life um but not open to the power of God or not hungry to the power of God. And some
1:13:15
of those Christians, they won't have bondage because they're keeping doors shut to the enemy. And other people,
1:13:21
though they're not opening doors to the enemy, they had bondage from the past that needs to be dealt with that needs
1:13:28
the anointing to come upon their lives. So that's another type of Christian that
1:13:34
we see today. Um, and then we have the Christian Pharisees,
1:13:42
which is like conflicting, polar opposites, but they call themselves Christians, but they're
1:13:48
really Pharisees. So, they say they're on God's team, but they're literally on the devil's team.
1:13:56
Um, on the outside, they may look like they uh
1:14:02
they may look like they're thriving. They may look like God is with them on the outside,
1:14:08
but on the inside, this isn't the case because you can't be against God and see
1:14:15
God's favor upon your life and see God's hand upon your life. That can't work. It
1:14:20
doesn't work that way. Um, and these Pharisees that came against Jesus, they
1:14:25
were 100% on the devil's team. They were saying they were on God's team. Many of
1:14:31
them maybe believed they were really on God's team, but in reality they were on the devil's team. They were being
1:14:36
influenced by the devil. And they were carrying out the devil's work to try to
1:14:42
keep people away from Jesus, from receiving from Jesus and being disciples, to falsely accuse Jesus, to
1:14:50
crucify Jesus and persecute him. And so there are there there's always been
1:14:56
Pharisees ever since the Pharisees in the times of Jesus. And before the Pharisees in the times of Jesus, there
1:15:02
was Pharisees in the Old Testament that would come against the servants of God
1:15:08
like Jezebel for example. Um but these uh Pharisees of today, they they
1:15:16
can be those Christians that you know many times they the mo usually the Pharisees are the ones that look really
1:15:22
like really great Christians on the outside. They're in the church always. They're preaching really good. Um,
1:15:29
they're talking about how much they love God. They seem to be doing lots of good works. And they're so passionate about
1:15:35
God, it seems, and they passionately speak about false prophets and
1:15:41
protecting people from being deceived and all of this. So, it can look on the outside like they have this fire for
1:15:48
Jesus and this great love for people, but in reality, they are on the devil's team.
1:15:54
Um, and there's no God's hand upon them bringing
1:16:00
miracles upon their life when they are on the devil's team. Um, and like I
1:16:06
said, it can look like, you know, it it can when you think about Saul, like
1:16:13
Saul was like acting like a Pharisee trying to kill the anointed servant of
1:16:19
God, David. Um, and when you look at Saul, he once he
1:16:26
lets jealousy enter his heart, it says that a de a demonic spirit entered him
1:16:32
and he would be tormented by these demonic spirits and it would make him um
1:16:39
have serious mental problems and uh that is so so so he opened the
1:16:45
door to the devil with being influenced by the jealous jealousy lies. And so
1:16:51
then it's like he he said yes to the devil. Like I will accept jealousy and I
1:16:57
will now hate David, the servant of God, anointed king, and I will now even try
1:17:03
to kill him, get him killed. So he's now carrying out the devil's works. And um
1:17:10
you know on the outside if you're if you if you imagine being in that time
1:17:17
remember he was king and he was even anointed by a true prophet Samuel Saul
1:17:22
was. So imagine being in that time and you're you're seeing, oh, he's an
1:17:28
anointed servant of God and but but now he's on this mission to kill David and
1:17:36
you're seeing that there's armies backing Saul up. Like it wasn't just
1:17:42
Saul trying to take out David. It's not like everyone was like, "No, David's anointed. We won't go and try to kill
1:17:50
David with you, Saul." No, they they did what Saul said to do. He was king. And
1:17:57
and and and it's so many years. It's many years that Saul is on the hunt for
1:18:04
David is hunting him, trying to kill him with armies, armies behind Saul.
1:18:11
Years are going by. So just imagine if you are a person back then in the that
1:18:18
time seeing this going on. You could wrongly think
1:18:24
that or wonder if God was with Saul
1:18:30
because he's not being struck down. God will allow like he literally allowed
1:18:37
Saul to keep hunting David for all these years.
1:18:44
He let him keep doing that. So just what I'm saying is like as a
1:18:49
bystander back then, you might be confused. You don't see Saul having repercussions
1:18:57
and you're not seeing the inside of him that's tormented by a demonic spirit.
1:19:03
On the outside, he's still king for years.
1:19:08
On the outside, he has armies backing him up. On the outside, poor David is hiding in
1:19:15
caves. I thought God's supposed to be with him, but now we know that God was with him,
1:19:23
but he wanted him to go through this refining fire.
1:19:30
And at the proper time, in God's perfect timing, God would bring David victory
1:19:37
and he would make Saul to be stopped and the promise would be fulfilled. David
1:19:44
would be placed as king. which was God's call for his life.
1:19:49
Nothing could stop that. He was given that victory. Hallelujah.
1:19:55
But God God wasn't missing anything through the time David was being hunted. He He
1:20:02
was allowing this for David's refining fire so that he could be prepared for
1:20:07
this calling, this great calling. That was his preparation. That was his preparation. Character was being built.
1:20:14
His faith was being built through this, through going through those trials.
1:20:19
That's what the refining fire does. It's what brings the gold. Hallelujah. Takes
1:20:24
out the impurities. So, but as a bystander, it can look like maybe what
1:20:32
Saul's doing isn't so bad and maybe God is still with him. But God wasn't with him. The anointing
1:20:38
left him and even he sent a demonic spirit to him. So
1:20:45
Pharisees, they have serious repercussions and what you sow you will reap.
1:20:50
Now God God wants them to turn to to to him and repent and he will make them
1:20:56
like Paul who used to be Saul and remove their past.
1:21:01
So there is that hope. Hallelujah. But what I just want to say is I I I like
1:21:07
don't think that if a person doesn't choose to repent that they just get away
1:21:13
with it. What you sow you reap. And don't be fooled if it looks like
1:21:18
there aren't repercussions just because you don't see God strike them down. God has so much mercy. He
1:21:24
gives people years and years and years to repent. And his ways are so much different than ours. He is a God of
1:21:31
justice. Don't be mistaken. He is the God of justice.
1:21:37
But his justice looks different than what what we think justice looks like.
1:21:42
His justice looks like staying with us in the caves, sticking
1:21:48
beside us, not letting us perish, being allowing us to go through refining
1:21:53
fire. It's for our good. leading us into the wilderness like
1:21:58
Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit in the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
1:22:05
That doesn't sound like fun, huh? That was not fun. But that's where the
1:22:11
Holy Spirit led Jesus for his good to be tested
1:22:18
to be refined as an example for us that we must go through this refining through
1:22:24
this wilderness be tempted be tested by the devil. Amen.
1:22:29
So justice looks different. The the the the justice that we're thinking of it does come. It does come but later than
1:22:37
we want it usually. Amen. But this justice also looks like
1:22:43
proving himself through us by our fruits by the fruits and people in pure in
1:22:49
heart seeing those fruits and seeing that God is with you. And this justice
1:22:54
looks like this justice and God being with you looks like miracles continuing
1:23:00
to pour upon your life. abundance of peace, abundance of joy, whether it's the mountaintop or the valley, and God
1:23:08
being able to use you mightily, like how Joseph even was used mightily by God in
1:23:13
the prison as God used him to interpret dreams
1:23:18
to the people who were in prison with him. So whether you're in the valley or
1:23:23
the mountaintop, the glory of God can still be revealed through you and God can do miracles through you still. The
1:23:30
hand of God is upon your life still and he will rescue you from every attack of the devil. Thank you, Lord.
1:23:37
Amen. So, that's what's going on on the inside that many people don't see.
1:23:42
That's what's going on in the inside. That's the truth. God's hand is with you in the mountain tops or the valleys.
1:23:49
Hallelujah. But God's hand is not with the Pharisees.
1:23:54
They're not experiencing the miraculous life and they're actually reaping. They're reaping bondage. And even don't
1:24:02
be fooled when it looks like people are prospering. The devil gives rewards, too.
1:24:08
But the blessings of God come without sorrow. And the rewards from the devil
1:24:14
come with sorrow. So that looks like demonic spirits, bondage. That can look like a every
1:24:21
single day flooded with guilt and condemnation.
1:24:27
It can look like just a life where there's no protection of God. So, anything bad can happen
1:24:36
and it not be turned around for good because you're not serving God. So, it's a it's a life of hell on earth
1:24:44
even if it's not shown on the outside. Do not be fooled by Pharisees
1:24:50
of today. That is not someone you want to align with. You don't want to follow their
1:24:57
example. God's hand will not be with you. Amen.
1:25:11
All right.
1:25:16
So now I want to talk about how to be on the winning team. That's how not to be on the winning team.
1:25:24
When you stand firmly with God, stand firmly and you surrender your life to
1:25:30
Jesus truly, which means accepting his move, which means accepting the cost,
1:25:37
accepting persecution that goes along with surrendering to God. The mighty hand of God will be upon your
1:25:44
life every day. And he will bring you victory upon victory. An overwhelming
1:25:51
victory every day in every situation. And you will experience a life of
1:25:57
miracles, a supernatural life every day. Supernatural favor that doesn't make
1:26:03
sense. It says in
1:26:09
uh 1 Corinthians 16:13, "Be on guard. Stand firm in your faith
1:26:17
in God, respecting his precepts and keeping your doctrine sound."
1:26:25
So, respecting his precepts, a synonym I looked up online for precepts is
1:26:30
principles. So God's way of moving, God's ways,
1:26:38
not being a Christian in whatever way you want, but truly truly respecting and
1:26:44
following his principles like his new wine principles that have been so lost in the body of Christ that
1:26:50
he is restoring now such as his principle of how he releases miracles and moves in moves in power which is by
1:26:57
his anointing he puts in vessels and also a principle of how to receive
1:27:03
impartation, anointing through impartation, not just any old way,
1:27:10
but impartation like we see Elijah released to Elisha, Paul released to Timothy, Moses released to Joshua.
1:27:18
His principles of sewing and reaping both financially and sewing in different areas.
1:27:25
His principles of the power of life and death is in the tongue. So be very
1:27:30
serious about only speaking positive or else you're opening up doors to the enemy in your life.
1:27:36
His principles of being planted in one church, a church where God's power is moving and a church that God is truly
1:27:43
calling you specifically to be planted in because that's where you'll be equipped to have victory over the enemy
1:27:49
and to be a powerful vessel of God. That's where you receive impartation. That's where you receive a protection in
1:27:54
the spiritual realm. That's where you'll receive the anointing to destroy any yoke whenever you need it. Receive miracles when you need it. Hallelujah.
1:28:02
So, I just briefly mentioned some of the principles, new wine
1:28:07
principles that are by and large not being taught in the body of Christ today, but are so foundational
1:28:14
for every believer. This is a big part of surrender to
1:28:20
Jesus. And this is how we stand firmly with God. With God on his side. And this
1:28:29
is when you will see abundant life come upon your life. This is when you will see the m miraculous come upon your
1:28:34
life. The favor come upon your life. This is where God can entrust you with anointing because you're actually
1:28:40
respecting his precepts. respecting his principles as this verse
1:28:45
says, if we can put it up there, respecting his precepts and keeping your
1:28:50
doctrine sound. Act like mature men and women and be
1:28:57
courageous. Be strong. If you didn't see last Sunday's message, watch it. But remember last Sunday how I shared one of
1:29:04
the most important ways of obedience meaning of obedience to God is to be
1:29:12
mature to be spiritually mature. That is a choice to take seriously the teachings
1:29:19
these principles that are released to you and apply them actually apply them
1:29:25
in your life. So it says here, act like mature men and
1:29:33
women. So that's a choice. That's an action you must do. Be mature. Hallelujah. And be courageous. Be
1:29:40
strong. You don't have to wait for the feelings of courage. You don't have to wait for the feelings of strength. You
1:29:47
can actually be courageous and be strong right now, every day. It's up to you because God
1:29:54
lives in you. So when you choose to do something, he backs you up. When you choose to do what
1:30:01
he's calling you to do, he gives you the strength and ability to do it.
1:30:08
You're not without the Holy Spirit calling out to God to come and give you strength. He's in you. Be strong. Be
1:30:15
mature. Apply the principles. And you'll be amazed at how the power of God gives you the strength. He gives you the
1:30:21
ability to do all that he's asking you to do. to do hard things that aren't hard with God.
1:30:28
Amen.
1:30:34
Hallelujah. Let everything you do be done in love,
1:30:39
motivated and inspired by God's love for us. So this scripture, the first verse,
1:30:45
it's saying, stand firm. Stand firm in your faith. Respect his
1:30:50
principles. Act mature. Be courageous and strong. Do everything in love. This
1:30:56
is a great summary of what it means to be on God's side.
1:31:02
To stand firm with God. to really be on God's side, be on his
1:31:08
team, where you see his mighty hand move upon your life, you have to stand firm,
1:31:14
not wimpy, not sway back and forth, not stick just one toe in, not stand
1:31:22
beside the will of God, but you have to stand firm directly in God's will, not
1:31:28
caring what other people think, not not being moving and shaken when persecution
1:31:34
comes, when the devil attacks standing firm.
1:31:39
Hallelujah.
1:31:45
So now I want to give you some examples of
1:31:51
what being a a a a real surrendered Christian, real disciple looks like. One
1:31:57
who stands firm with God. And I want to see I want you to see what happens in
1:32:02
their life when they stand firm. So, we're going to go to 2 Chronicles 20:17
1:32:07
and then verse 24. You need not fight in this battle. Uh
1:32:14
the word of God is coming to uh uh the leader of of the people of God right
1:32:20
now, Jehoshaphat. You there's a massive army coming against them. Massive,
1:32:27
way bigger than them in the physical. The word of God comes forth. You need not fight in this battle. take your
1:32:33
positions. Stand and witness the salvation of the Lord who is with you, oh Judah and Jerusalem. Do not fear or
1:32:40
be dismayed. Tomorrow go out against them, for the Lord is with you. Verse
1:32:46
24, when the men of Judah came to the lookout tower of the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude, and behold,
1:32:52
there they were dead bodies lying on the ground, and no one had escaped. When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take
1:32:59
their spoil, they found much among them, including equipment, garments, and valuable things which they took for
1:33:04
themselves, more than they could carry away. So, so much that they spent three days gathering the spoil.
1:33:13
So, this is what it looks like to stand firmly with God.
1:33:19
Massive armies are coming against you, but God's eye is on you and his hand is
1:33:25
upon you and he is on your side and he brings you, he himself, God himself
1:33:31
brings you the victory. It says you don't even have to fight him. God will fight him.
1:33:38
And God brought them God brought them an overwhelming
1:33:45
victory. So this is the mighty hand of God that comes upon your life when you
1:33:50
stand with God. Now these pe these people that experience this mighty hand of God, God's people,
1:33:58
they were on they were in God's army. They were an army. They were being about
1:34:05
the father's business. They were not just living however they wanted being lazy but they were active
1:34:14
actively in God's army. This is when we see mighty the God's
1:34:20
mighty hand come upon them. So to be to stand firm with God, to
1:34:27
really stand with God means to love his people, to be about his business, to
1:34:34
take your place in the revival army, not be a bystander and just watch, but to stand in that army. That's when you get
1:34:41
to experience the mighty hand of God bringing you victory. Amen.
1:34:47
Hallelujah. Okay. Now we're going to see the example of Joshua.
1:34:53
Joshua 6:1. So now we have another um group of God's
1:35:01
people. They were an army as well. And they were on a mission. God was taking them into the promised land, not just so
1:35:08
that they could frolic and have fun and enjoy the food and the sunshine,
1:35:16
but he was bringing them there for a purpose. He was bringing them there to fulfill his mission, his assignment that
1:35:23
he had for them. He he he was calling them to do the work
1:35:28
of God. And this work of God would continue until I mean not until up till
1:35:33
now and keeps on going. Amen. This is the history of the work of God. This is
1:35:39
our lineage. So they were an army of God once again.
1:35:45
And it says, "Now Jericho, a fortified city with high walls, was tightly closed because of the people's fear of the sons
1:35:52
of Israel. No one went or came in. The Lord said to Joshua, "See, I have given
1:36:00
Jericho into your hand with its king and the mighty warriors." And so after this,
1:36:06
then God instructs them on what to do of how to see the victory, how to see God's
1:36:12
victory. So he instructed them to walk around the walls of Jericho several times for several days. And
1:36:20
after the last time that he called them to march around the walls of Jericho, God made the wall to come down.
1:36:28
And so they weren't doing anything with such force. What they were doing was very simple. Marching around, bl uh uh
1:36:36
yelling shouting, uh bling the trumpet. They aren't doing anything too crazy,
1:36:42
too wild. They are just simply obeying God and keeping on going, obeying God.
1:36:48
Not putting their logic into it, their mind into it so much, but just simply
1:36:54
like a child obeying what God has spoken, keeping on going, not stopping short. And then they experience God's
1:37:01
mighty hand come and bring them victory. And now it says, God says, "I have given
1:37:08
you." Oh, that's powerful. I have given you.
1:37:13
It's already done. This is before they I mean, this is when they're outside of the walls. They
1:37:19
weren't even trying to chip away at the blocks yet or anything. They weren't trying to throw uh weapons, bombs or
1:37:26
something in the devil's camp. They're just simply children of God who were
1:37:32
standing firm with God, obeying him day by day. And all of a sudden, God says,
1:37:37
"I've given you this land." This is how you'll see the victory come
1:37:43
that I've already given you. You just do a simple thing of obeying, and I will give it to you. I have given it to you.
1:37:49
Praise God. You see how powerful it is to stand firm with God in his army,
1:37:56
revival army. Wow. Hallelujah.
1:38:03
Now, and we're going to go to the example of David. 1st Samuel 17:46. So, um, David was about his father's
1:38:11
business as well. He was commanding armies. He was doing the work of God. He was not just chilling, hanging out,
1:38:17
worshiping God with his harp alone. He was doing the work of God, commanding
1:38:23
the armies, worshiping God and worshiping also him
1:38:28
with with with the works. Hallelujah.
1:38:33
So there was many battles that David had where he was coming against enemies.
1:38:39
They were the people of God were coming against armies and God would just give them victory after victory after
1:38:44
victory. 1st Samuel 17:46. Today the Lord will con to today the Lord will
1:38:50
conquer you and I will kill you and cut off your head. Oh, but before we actually before we get to that, we're
1:38:56
going to go backwards before he even was king. And this scripture is when he defeated Goliath.
1:39:02
Amen. So um God called him to to defeat Goliath. And
1:39:10
it says, "Today the Lord will conquer you." That's Goliath. And David says, this is David speaking. Today the Lord
1:39:16
will conquer you and I will cut you and cut off your head. And then I will give the dead bodies of your men to the birds
1:39:21
and wild animals and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel and everyone assembled here will know that the Lord rescues his people but not
1:39:28
with sword and spear. This is the Lord's battle and he will give you to us. As
1:39:36
Goliath moved closer to attack, David quickly ran out to meet him. Reaching into his shepherd's bag and taking out a
1:39:41
stone, he hurled it with his sling and hit the Philistine in his forehead. The stone sank in and Goliath stumbled and
1:39:46
fell face down on the ground. So David triumphed over the Philistine with only a sling and a stone for he had no sword.
1:39:55
So we see in this scripture we see that it's God bringing this victory once again.
1:40:04
So when when David obeys with a sling out in the stone, it was God's power in
1:40:09
him, moving in his arm, pulling it back just the right amount, aiming it just the
1:40:16
right way. So that that's it it was it was the power of God upon that stone, gliding it
1:40:23
in the air to hit it at the perfect spot that would knock him down, Goliath down
1:40:29
dead. Come on. Look how powerful it is when you stand firm with God.
1:40:36
The victory God brings you. Hallelujah. So then we see now David becomes king
1:40:42
later on and now he is having many battles and God is bringing him victory every time. Here's one example. 2 Samuel
1:40:48
8:13. So David became even more famous when he returned from destroying 18,000
1:40:53
in the valley of Salt. He placed army garrisons throughout Edom and all the Edom became David's
1:41:01
subjects. In fact, the Lord made David
1:41:06
victorious wherever he went. I'm going to read that again. In fact,
1:41:13
the Lord made David victorious
1:41:18
everywhere he went. Hallelujah.
1:41:28
Now we're going to look at the example of Elisha. 2 Kings 6:15.
1:41:33
So um in this example Elisha Al in the story
1:41:38
Elisha's servant comes and he finds this huge army that's way bigger than
1:41:46
Elisha's army, their army, the army of God in the physical. And he's really
1:41:51
concerned. He's worried. And it says, "When the servant of the man of God got up early the next morning and went
1:41:57
outside, there were troops, horses, and chariots everywhere." "Oh sir, what will we do now?" The young man cried to
1:42:03
Elisha, "Don't be afraid," Elisha told him, for there are more on our side than
1:42:09
on theirs. Then Elisha prayed, "Oh Lord, open his eyes and let him see." The Lord
1:42:15
opened the young man's eyes. And when he looked up, he saw that the hillside around Elisha was filled with horses and
1:42:23
chariots of fire. So in other words, there was an angelic
1:42:28
army, God's army in the spiritual realm that was so much bigger than that physical
1:42:36
army coming against them. And God gave them victory. God God gave Elisha victory. Amen.
1:42:43
Hallelujah. So all of these examples in the word of
1:42:48
God, these are just some. There are so there are many more. But time and time again, we find these servants of God who
1:42:56
are truly surrendered to God, who are about the father's business, who are standing in God's revival army. God
1:43:04
brings them victory every time. God's hand moves and defeats the enemies for
1:43:12
them. every time. So in the Bible, in these examples in
1:43:19
the Bible, in the Old Testament that I shared with you, these are physical armies,
1:43:26
physical army of God um having victory over the physical uh uh armies coming
1:43:34
against them. They're enemies, but it was a spiritual battle. Now today, we
1:43:40
it's the same thing. There's God's revival army. You are God's revival army. We are God's re revival army.
1:43:49
Hallelujah. And
1:43:54
there are enemies. There's a enemy of Pharisees. That's the that's the main enemies against the work of God
1:44:02
that that try to come against the revival army. They try to come against God.
1:44:08
But we have a a spiritual army backing us up. We have angel armies
1:44:14
backing us up that are more powerful than the demonic
1:44:20
armies that are with the Pharisees, the enemies of our enemies.
1:44:28
And on top of there being an an angelic army, we have just the the in general
1:44:35
the mighty hand of God. that dispels the angel army that backs
1:44:41
us up, that moves miraculously to defeat our enemies. Every single time
1:44:50
the enemies back then would come, the armies, the the the enemy armies, they
1:44:56
would come physically trying to kill the people of God, trying to kill the servants of God, like in the case of
1:45:03
David, Saul trying to kill David. But today, you can't get away with that. You
1:45:09
can't get away with just killing people. You go to prison. So that seriously, that's like the
1:45:15
difference cuz times change like that. But people are the same. Like like the the hatred,
1:45:23
you know, that that Pharisees have for the people of God, for the army of God, they try to kill in different ways. They
1:45:30
try to kill through words. They try to kill through exposed videos. They try to
1:45:35
kill through social media and all these different ways they try to kill the work
1:45:42
the servants of God, the work of God. They try to kill emotionally in their hearts. They try to kill the actual
1:45:49
church church the the the the services, the move of God.
1:45:55
And so it's so much similar that we see in the Old Testament
1:46:00
these the the war the war going on. The war was physical and spiritual back then
1:46:06
and it is physical and spiritual today. They physically use words today instead
1:46:11
of bullets. They physically upload videos today in instead of uh back then
1:46:17
it probably wouldn't have been bullets yet, but you know what I mean. Their weapons that they were using their
1:46:22
bows and arrows and everything. Hallelujah. Um,
1:46:28
so but but the same principle applies of God's army always having victory
1:46:37
because you're on God's side. If God is for us, who can be against us?
1:46:44
Who can be successful against us? Nobody. It's not possible.
1:46:52
Nobody can defeat God. No demonic power can defeat God. No exposed video going
1:46:58
viral can defeat God. No gross, madeup, lie, false accusation
1:47:04
can defeat God. Nothing can defeat God.
1:47:11
Nothing. So, you know, in in these examples I give, it's you're it's looking scary.
1:47:18
These armies look really big. Their weapons look really big. Saul and his
1:47:23
army. They have a big army. It's David just running in the caves. Like, it looks scary.
1:47:30
But God's army was so much more massive than their enemies. And God's hand came
1:47:37
through every time. God didn't miss a day of battle. It's not like God was sleeping one day
1:47:44
and the devil won. Never happened. Never will happen.
1:47:50
God's mighty hand will bring victory every single day for for his army for
1:47:56
people who are standing with him in his army always. Hallelujah.
1:48:04
Hallelujah. Romans 8:35.
1:48:10
Can anyone ever Can anything ever separate us from Christ's love? Does it mean he no longer loves us if we have
1:48:16
trouble or calamity or are persecuted or hungry or destitute or in danger or
1:48:21
threatened with death? I want to I want to highlight this. Does it mean he no longer loves us if we are
1:48:28
persecuted? Does it means the devil is winning if we are persecuted?
1:48:35
Does it mean we should be in despair and start worrying and start doubting and and maybe give up if we are persecuted?
1:48:43
Does it mean the enemy is winning if we're persecuted? Does it mean those who persecute us, Pharisees, are winning if
1:48:49
we are persecuted? No. As the scriptures say, for your sake, we
1:48:55
are killed every day. We are being slaughtered like sheep. We are being slaughter. We words of
1:49:02
death are sent to us in the forms of persecution. servants of God especially every day there are negative words
1:49:08
whether seen or unseen by the servant of God sent by Pharisees by enemies we are
1:49:13
slaughtered like sheep meaning we are put on the chopping block but God preserves us and we have joy and we have
1:49:20
peace and we have victory but people are trying to pick on us trying to bring us
1:49:27
down but they're defeated but this is the meaning you know as it says we are we are slaughtered it doesn't mean like
1:49:33
we are literally slaughtered But do do you see what I mean? It means people are coming against us every day.
1:49:41
But despite no despite all these things, it says no. Does it mean he no longer loves us? Blah blah blah. Does it mean
1:49:49
he no longer loves us if we are persecuted? No. It says,
1:49:56
"Despite all these things, despite all these things, despite all persecution,
1:50:02
despite all exposed videos, despite all negative words, despite all hatred and
1:50:07
hearts of people who are jealous and prideful, despite
1:50:13
all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ who loved
1:50:22
us. Not just victory. The the the Bible says
1:50:29
overwhelming victory. Overwhelming victory.
1:50:36
Woo is ours. Is ours.
1:50:43
Say, "It's mine." Say, "Victory
1:50:48
is mine." Victory is mine.
1:50:54
Hallelujah. Victory is ours.
1:51:00
Despite everything, no matter what, it's ours.
1:51:06
Amen. Through Christ who loved us. Hallelujah.
1:51:12
Hallelujah. Psalms 112:1 says, "Praise the Lord.
1:51:18
How joyful are those who fear the Lord and delight in obeying his commands.
1:51:24
Their children will be successful everywhere. An entire generation of godly people will be blessed. They
1:51:30
themselves will be wealthy and their good deeds will last forever. Light shines in the darkness for the godly.
1:51:37
They are generous, compassionate and righteous. Good comes to those who lend money generously and conduct their
1:51:42
business fairly. Such people will not be overcome by evil. Those who are
1:51:47
righteous will be long remembered. They do not fear bad news.
1:51:53
They confidently trust the Lord to care for them.
1:51:59
They are confident and fearless and can face their foes triumphantly.
1:52:05
[Applause]
1:52:10
They share freely and give generously to those in need. Their good deeds will be remembered forever. They will have
1:52:16
influence and honor. The wicked will see this and be infuriated. They will grind
1:52:21
their teeth in anger. They will slink away, their hopes thwarted. So this means that the wicked will be
1:52:28
frustrated because God will always give you overwhelming victory.
1:52:36
This is why we should face our foes with
1:52:41
courage. What does it say? Triumphantly. They are confident and fearless and can
1:52:47
face their foes triumphantly.
1:52:55
So in other words, why would you get down, be discouraged, be afraid when
1:53:01
persecution comes your way? When people falsely accuse you and lie about you?
1:53:07
When people think wrongly about you? When people try to stop you and what God
1:53:13
has called you to do, why would you fear? Why would you be
1:53:18
discouraged? The Bible says that we we children of God should face our foes
1:53:25
triumphantly. Wow. [Applause]
1:53:30
So to so so to have fear in the face of persecution, in the face of attack, to
1:53:35
have discouragement, to have doubt, to get down,
1:53:41
that's to be cowardly. I mean, that's to not
1:53:47
know or have revelation or remember the God who is on your side,
1:53:55
fighting every battle for you, coming with his mighty hand every single time.
1:54:06
and and God has taught me this. And I pray you learn from my example. I pray
1:54:14
even those of you who have been around for some years and have seen me go
1:54:19
through some some persecution or maybe if you haven't been around for some few years, but you've heard about it. I pray
1:54:26
that you can learn and believe me when I say
1:54:33
that there is no need to let the devil get to you, get to your heart. Whenever
1:54:40
persecution comes, whenever try someone is trying to stop you, whenever
1:54:45
someone's trying to question your faith and trying to stop you from doing what God has called you to do,
1:54:52
you there's no reason to fear. There's no reason to be sad. There's no reason
1:54:58
to doubt. There's no reason to think maybe they're winning. Maybe the devil's
1:55:04
winning. You're believing a lie if you're doing those things. I'm telling you,
1:55:11
you should face your enemies. You should face the devil. You should face persecution triumphantly every time.
1:55:18
Like how David said, "I'll fight him. No problem." God who is with me when I'm
1:55:25
fighting the animals, the bears, the lions, he's going to be with me now, too. This Goliath is much bigger.
1:55:35
But I know that he's going to be with me again, even though this de this enemy is
1:55:41
bigger. And you see David not afra. You see him facing Goliath triumphantly. And God
1:55:48
wants you to have this attitude, this confidence of a victor that you are.
1:55:58
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I've I've I've gone through persecution
1:56:04
that I never would have dreamed of. I've gone through um attacks from of the devil using people, doing evil things,
1:56:12
speaking evil things against me, making up lies. I could never imagine people would be capable of doing this. Any
1:56:17
person, let alone someone who calls himself a Christian, a pastor, a minister, could never imagine this. I've
1:56:24
been through that time and time again. But I have never
1:56:30
seen God let me down. I have seen him bring me victory.
1:56:36
I have seen him bring me victory every time. I have seen him fight every battle for
1:56:43
me. This is years now. This is eight years now. I'm talking eight years. I've
1:56:50
seen God bring victory upon victory for my life. I've seen God bring victory after
1:56:56
victory for 5F Church and for his move for this revival.
1:57:01
He's never failed me yet. He's never failed us yet. And he never will.
1:57:10
Never. And I pray you will grasp this revelation
1:57:16
so you can live this life of a victor. We are not reaching for victory trying
1:57:23
to get victory. It's not a question on this earth. Even though you have a good record as a runner, you don't really
1:57:29
know if you'll win the race or not. We know we will win because God is on our side.
1:57:35
There's not It's not like on the earth you have a chance of losing. Maybe you're the best athlete, but you could still get an injury. It's not like that
1:57:43
with God. God can't get an injury. God can't miss it. He can't miss.
1:57:52
That's who's on your team, leading your team.
1:57:58
This is the winning team of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
1:58:04
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:58:14
Hallelujah. Victory is ours. Victory is ours.
1:58:22
Victory is ours. Victory is ours.
1:58:28
Hallelujah. In Jesus Christ. Victory is ours.
1:58:33
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
1:58:40
And so when you're feeling the heat of persecution, when you're in a valley,
1:58:46
never again think you're being punished. Never again think the devil's winning.
1:58:54
This is different. When you're in the anointing, you're not in bondage anymore.
1:59:01
Was David punished as he was being chased by Saul? Was he being punished by
1:59:07
God for making a mistake or something? No. Was Joseph being punished when he was
1:59:12
thrown in the pit when he was then thrown in the prison? No. God allowed this as a beautiful,
1:59:20
precious, necessary, refining fire process for him to become for David to
1:59:26
become as well the leaders that God intended them to be. Amen.
1:59:33
If you want to be great for God, you have to go through hard things.
1:59:39
It's a joy to go through hard things for the sake of Jesus, for the sake of him being able to use
1:59:46
you how he wants to save and heal and deliver his people. So, it's a joy to go
1:59:53
through hard things. Jesus says, it says with a joy set before him, he endured the cross.
2:00:00
This should be your attitude. If you go through valleys, if you go through persecution, this is what I
2:00:07
need. God knows I need this. Hallelujah. [Applause]
2:00:22
And and there's a perspective that God wants to you to be shifted in your mind about.
2:00:28
He wants you to understand how you always have victory. Okay? He wants you to really grasp that. He doesn't want
2:00:35
you to think you're being punished sometimes when you're in the wilderness. He He doesn't want you to think um He
2:00:41
doesn't want you to be so confused when you're when it seems like the promise is delaying. But God never delays in his
2:00:47
promise. It's his perfect time. He doesn't want you to be confused like, "Don't I deserve the promise by now yet?
2:00:54
I don't understand why it's not here yet." He doesn't want you to be even confused. He wants you to rest knowing
2:01:00
his timing is perfect. Knowing his ways are perfect. Knowing that you don't know the big picture. God does. It's not just
2:01:07
about you. It's not just about you being happy in the promised land and frolicking and enjoying the food and
2:01:13
sunshine. You're going to the promised land for a greater purpose. It's for
2:01:18
God's people. And so, there's some mysteries you don't understand as to why things aren't happening yet. So rest and
2:01:25
live victoriously. Live triumphantly in the waiting. Amen.
2:01:32
The victory is coming and you're already living in it every day with Jesus.
2:01:37
Now, now, now think about this. Caleb and Joshua. Um, okay. I don't know if some of you
2:01:44
know this, but the Israelites, it took them about one to one and a half years
2:01:50
to first get to Canaan, the promised land. It should only have taken 11 days, but
2:01:56
it took them about 1 to one and a half years to first get to Canaan. The first time, the first time when they reached
2:02:03
Canaan, only after a year, year to year and a half, God gave them an opportunity
2:02:10
to conquer the promised land. He sent spies in there to spy out the land, to
2:02:17
spy out, to see the enemies, how powerful they were, and everything. And Caleb and Joshua were among these spies.
2:02:24
They came back and there's supposed to be only one right answer because God there's only one answer that they should
2:02:30
have had which was a good report saying we'll be able to conquer the enemies because God already told them I've given
2:02:36
you this land. So they should they already know the stories of the past of how God would
2:02:41
always come through you know do they just saw all of the miracles and signs and wonders and the splitting of the
2:02:47
sea. So, what are these armies compared to their God? Right? But all of
2:02:54
the spies except for two, Joshua and Caleb, said, "Oh, they're too big and scary. We're not going to be able to
2:03:00
defeat them. We better not even try cuz we're going to just die." And so, this was a lack of faith. And
2:03:08
so, God saw they were not, these people were not ready to go into the promised land. Their faith hadn't been built up
2:03:15
enough yet. They wouldn't be able to do what God had called them to do when they got in the promised land. They had to be
2:03:22
prepared more. They weren't ready yet. He gave them a chance, but they weren't ready yet. Except for Joshua and Caleb.
2:03:30
They would have been ready. So then God sentences them to 40 years in the
2:03:35
wilderness for them to get ready, for them to be prepared. And so after 40 years, Joshua and Caleb
2:03:43
were the only ones that that made it from the original group that went into the wilderness. Now it's a new
2:03:48
generation. God was preparing this new generation, making sure that they were ready this time.
2:03:55
And then Joshua led them into the promised land. Okay, now think about
2:04:01
this. Can you think about Can you put yourselves in Joshua and Ca Joshua and Caleb's shoes?
2:04:07
Can you imagine? You are fully surrendered to God. You are being obedient to follow his
2:04:13
principles, to believe his word, to be people of strong faith. And now God has
2:04:19
brought you to the promised land. You're ready to walk in your promised land.
2:04:24
And God says, "You're ready, but the rest aren't.
2:04:30
I need you to all go together, so you have to wait for 40 years.
2:04:39
Have you ever thought about that? What's impressive about their character
2:04:46
is we don't see them complaining. We see them being faithful.
2:04:53
Continue to be faithful to God. Wait on God. Be patient.
2:04:59
And that would be hard to understand, hard to grasp. But they surrendered their understanding
2:05:05
to God and just simply trusted God like a child. I know God's good. God's ways are
2:05:12
higher than mine. So, I'll just obey and not complain and be patient
2:05:17
and stand on the word of God that we will enter the promised land in God's perfect timing.
2:05:28
Joshua 14:10. Now, as you can see, the Lord has kept me alive. This is Caleb
2:05:33
speaking. Now, as you can see, the Lord has kept me alive and well as he promised for all these 45 years since
2:05:39
Moses made this promise. Even while Israel wandered in the wilderness, today I am 85 years old. So, um, him and
2:05:46
Joshua were around in their 40s when they went to Canaan the first time. And
2:05:52
so, then they were 85 and in their and Joshua was in his 70s when they finally got to enter the promised land. But you
2:05:58
see, you can you can hear in their voices in the scripture that they weren't bitter,
2:06:04
that they had a pure heart before God. They trusted in him. And God spoke to me through the scripture. And he spoke he
2:06:09
spoke to me. It was so powerfully just like showing me the promises, the promises of revival. It's not about one
2:06:16
person. It's not about five people. It's not about a hundred people. It's not about 500 people entering the promised
2:06:23
land. this promised land of revival expanding all over the world. It's it's
2:06:30
a much bigger picture than many people realize, than many of you realize
2:06:35
because in this revival, God is transforming his whole body. He
2:06:41
He is transforming and purifying his whole body. This revival is not just supposed to be about one church just
2:06:48
having their own revival and move. But what God is doing is so much bigger.
2:06:56
Day by day, step by step, person by person, he's bringing transformation,
2:07:02
purification into the whole body of Christ. He is restoring his anointing. He's
2:07:08
restoring his new wine ways. It's massive what God is doing.
2:07:15
And this is really humbling because me, you, many of you may be like Joshua and
2:07:23
Caleb, ready to to run to the stadiums and
2:07:30
these big promises that God has spoken of this revival. You know, we may be
2:07:36
ready, but others are not yet.
2:07:41
So we have to go with God's timing.
2:07:47
And and this is true for me even with when the f um four and a half four years
2:07:53
ago in 2021 when revival broke out. I really thought that this revival was
2:08:00
going to break out years before that when I first received this prophetic word. And maybe there was an opportunity
2:08:07
for it to, just like there was an opportunity for the Israelites
2:08:13
to go into the promised land after a year or a year and a half, but instead it took 40.
2:08:19
But it wasn't about me. This revival wasn't about me.
2:08:25
It was about the whole body of Christ being a part of this revival.
2:08:31
And so I remember I would just have and even prophetic words can be this way. Prophetic words can be like it's
2:08:37
happening soon and maybe God does want it to happen in a year but instead it has to be more years because it depends
2:08:42
on if people are ready or not if they will be obey or not. So sometimes these prophetic words that you hear it it it
2:08:48
is this zeal and excitement of God to do things fast but it's up to people to go at his pace.
2:08:54
So it's not that the prophecy didn't come to pass yet. It's not that the prophecy was delivered wrong.
2:09:00
It's just things can change if people aren't ready yet.
2:09:06
But God is so good and patient. You know, those Israelites, they did make it into the promised land. It just took
2:09:13
longer, but they did make it there. This is how it is with this. This is how it
2:09:18
was with this revival. I really thought it was going to break out sooner, but it still broke out.
2:09:24
Four and a half years later, there's the number four again. Hallelujah.
2:09:29
And and there's more promises of this revival of massive ways God is going to
2:09:34
move through the media, move in stadiums,
2:09:40
massive, massive promises. God has given me, God has given 5F Church. God has
2:09:47
given this move of God, this revival where we have just seen a little bit of
2:09:53
what's in store. Hallelujah. But God is moving so perfectly in his
2:10:01
timing, in his ways that are beyond our understanding. So this is the importance of us
2:10:08
remembering the promises are not about us. It's about God's people.
2:10:14
So when you find yourself getting so obsessed with the promise and why isn't here yet, you're probably thinking about
2:10:21
yourself too much. The promise isn't about yourself. It's about other people. It's about God. It's about the body of
2:10:27
Christ. Amen. Hallelujah.
2:10:37
We are the Joshua generation. We are the Joshua generation entering
2:10:42
the promised land of revival.
2:10:48
And and today we are God spoke this God spoke this specifically to me. He said that today I want my people to celebrate
2:10:55
the victories that I have brought them. The victories I have brought them in this revival. I want them to celebrate.
2:11:02
He wants us to celebrate today. He has brought so many victories to us
2:11:08
and he's going to continue to bring so many victories. And um I was I was seeing you know I was
2:11:17
so amazed in Sweden because we just started the small groups just a few months ago the five of church small
2:11:23
groups and I'm just in awe of God of the victory he's brought through these small
2:11:28
groups of the expansion of this revival that he's brought through these small groups.
2:11:33
It's so powerful in such a short amount of time and I celebrate God. I celebrate
2:11:39
what he is doing spreading this revival in other nations and states. Hallelujah.
2:11:45
And so um we have we have small groups 40 small groups around the US and around
2:11:50
the world. And we and we have um 18 of those small
2:11:56
groups are in other nations around the world. And I I was seeing in Sweden, I
2:12:02
was seeing so many of the the two of the leaders of the small group and also other small group leaders in Finland and
2:12:09
Norway. They were sharing. They were on the stage sharing about sharing the announcements and just just standing as
2:12:16
leaders in God's revival army for their nation, for Scandinavia, for the Nordic. Hallelujah.
2:12:21
And um I'm see I met with these small groups and I'm I'm just I'm in awe of
2:12:28
how God is equipping and building his church, his revival in all these
2:12:33
different nations. And the Lord was showing me like these small group leaders and many of you
2:12:40
here, those who serve at 5F Church, you are like Joshua and Caleb.
2:12:49
There are many around you. There are many believers around you, churches that you came from, family, friends of the
2:12:56
past who did not have that spirit.
2:13:02
The Bible says, I don't have the scripture for you here, but there's a scripture that says that Joshua and Caleb had a different spirit.
2:13:09
It literally says the word a different spirit and they reported the good report so that that they had a spirit of
2:13:15
humility, childlikeness, and faith and obedience.
2:13:21
You have that spirit. Others don't have that spirit. They call themselves Christians. They're in Christians of
2:13:27
these different categories that I've shared. But they don't have that spirit, but you have that spirit. And you are like
2:13:32
Joshua and Caleb in this Joshua generation we are in. And because of you, now look at this.
2:13:39
Joshua and Caleb were first of all, Moses was used mightily by God to lead
2:13:45
to be a leader for Joshua and Caleb. He led the way transforming them to be
2:13:53
like God and to follow God and to believe in God and to receive impartation.
2:13:58
He did his job and then their job, Joshua and Caleb's job was then to be an
2:14:04
example for that new generation that would then enter the promised land.
2:14:10
Look how powerful one person Moses is. Even if it's just two people that bore fruit from him.
2:14:17
And then those two people, that's millions of Israelites. Two people, they
2:14:22
they they they had they were that example. And people followed their example. And God saw they were ready
2:14:28
now. They were transformed. They could go into the promised land. So God spoke this to me that those of you that are
2:14:34
here, those of you that are serving, those of you who are small group leaders, those of you across the world
2:14:39
who have said yes to Jesus, you are in this revival army. You are like Joshua and Caleb.
2:14:45
And you what you're doing is so powerful. People are following your example. Whether you know it or not, you
2:14:52
are the light in the darkness. You you are carrying the torch of revival. And
2:14:58
many will come and believe in Jesus, will come and be a part of this revival
2:15:03
because of your example. Hallelujah.
2:15:08
Hallelujah. And God was giving me this picture of
2:15:14
like when you think about it, it feels like really depressing that there's millions of Israelites and only two like
2:15:22
make it, you know, only two can be faithful to God.
2:15:28
It's like kind of depressing to think about, right? But like like it can make
2:15:33
you feel like, oh, this is how it can be in revival. Like how come there's so much rejection? How come people don't
2:15:39
get it? How come people don't see? You feel like such a minority,
2:15:44
especially among your family and friends. Joshua and Caleb, you're like Joshua and Caleb.
2:15:51
But mil so many people entered the promised land because Joshua because of
2:15:56
Joshua and Caleb's example. It changed the the tide turned. The tide changed
2:16:03
drastically because they obeyed God. And this is what we're going to see in this revival.
2:16:09
Hallelujah. The tides are turning. Is that the right
2:16:14
metaphor or is it changing? Tides are turning. Tides are turning.
2:16:20
The tides are turning. It's happening. We are entering the promised land of
2:16:27
revival. We are We are already there. but the promised land of of revival being accepted all over the world in the
2:16:36
body of Christ, not being hindered or held back. Hallelujah.
2:16:41
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
2:16:47
March on Joshua generation. March on. God is using you powerfully
2:16:55
and you will make history like Joshua and Caleb made history. This is the end
2:17:00
time revival. This revival will never end and you will be known as a Joshua generation.
2:17:09
Hallelujah. Anybody excited? Thank you, Jesus. God, we thank you for
2:17:16
all these victories you have brought us. You know, can we put up we have I have a slide here. I I want to take we're
2:17:22
running short on time, but I just want to share like I I want to I want us to as we even worship during ministry time,
2:17:28
I want us to celebrate what God has done so far. These are nations where and
2:17:34
cities where revival is now events or conferences have been in the past four
2:17:39
years, just four years. 19 nations.
2:17:45
Look, it's like all over the world. [Music]
2:17:52
[Applause] This is despite
2:17:57
so much persecution, so many schemes of the devil, using
2:18:02
people, speaking nonsense, false accusations, making their their
2:18:09
videos. This is after people trying to stop these events from happening in all
2:18:15
different ways. I'm not going to reveal all the ways. I don't want to give anybody ideas.
2:18:20
But someday I will share with you. But all these different ways people have tried have made great efforts. Not great
2:18:28
like a lot of they took a lot of efforts to stop these events from happening
2:18:35
to stop us from having church. And look what God has done. Nothing
2:18:40
could nothing could stop these events from from going forth. Not not a single one did the devil win.
2:18:49
and on and and and and and and every single event so many people have been saved, healed, delivered, encountered
2:18:56
the love of Jesus, received impartation, the baptism of the Holy Spirit was set on fire. Every single one, every single
2:19:04
one. So much victory.
2:19:10
We are have people planted from 162 nations. Even someone in Palestine became part of five of church this week.
2:19:19
Th this is overwhelming victory. I mean, this is like we can't count the
2:19:26
victories. We can't count the victories. We can't count the battles. There's been so many. We can't count the victories.
2:19:34
How great is our God? How great is our God? Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
2:19:42
Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
2:19:50
If you're not already, I want to encourage you. Come to the winning team.
2:19:55
Stand firmly on God's side. This is where you'll see his mighty hand come
2:20:00
upon your life, favor upon favor, and live a life of miracles every day. This
2:20:07
is where you'll be used powerfully by God and fulfill your purpose on this earth.

2:20:20
Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus.
2:20:26
Thank you, Jesus. We're going to praise him like never before in a bit because we're celebrating these victories today.
2:20:33
I want to invite you all to give to God right now. We have Paris and New Zealand
2:20:39
events that we are planning, but before we can start booking venues. We need to
2:20:44
raise the funds for it. So, I encourage you, we have a fund for Paris, a a
2:20:51
revival event in Paris and New Zealand. And God wants us to do many more events
2:20:56
than these, but we have to raise the funds. So this is a big way that God is
2:21:01
asking his army to step it up so that he can so that he can move in all these
2:21:06
different events around the world. Amen. Hallelujah. And to be here every week.
2:21:11
It's a great cost. So I want to thank you first of all all of you who are giving every week. This is a powerful
2:21:18
way that God is using you and his revival army so that his works can go forth. Amen.
2:21:24
Thank you Jesus. Thank you Lord. Hallelujah. As you give, God pours out
2:21:32
so much upon your life. This is, as I mentioned, one of the principles, great
2:21:37
principles of following God is sewing and reaping. And so, as you sew, you
2:21:43
truly reap. You truly reap. There's a powerful principle in sewing. We heard
2:21:48
this testimony actually earlier today of a woman. She swed a seed specifically for her husband. And what was the
2:21:54
testimony? That her husband got a promotion, right? Then two days later, that's a powerful principle of sewing.
2:22:01
Many miss. There's power in sewing. There's power in making sacrifice to
2:22:07
God. There's power in putting God first and him then taking care of things in
2:22:13
your life. Amen. Hallelujah. If you want to give online, these are the ways you
2:22:19
can go to the link in my bio. If you're watching on Instagram, lift your hands right now or your seeds right now.
2:22:27
I release this anointing upon every one of you giving upon every seed. Let there
2:22:33
be a harvest. Let there be an increase. Let there be doors that open up for you
2:22:38
of provision in Jesus' name. I break every curse of poverty now. And I speak
2:22:44
your life to be filled with abundance. Your your cup to overflow. And for you to see the blessing it is to
2:22:52
to be a blessing to God's kingdom. May you see the blessings that pour upon your life because you have been a
2:22:58
blessing to God's kingdom. Because you have been a blessing with your sewing, because you have blessed others in this
2:23:05
way in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. You can bring your seed forward right now.

2:25:17
you need miracles, I encourage you to come lift your faith. If you need
2:25:23
deliverance, if you need healing, I encourage you to come to the altar. If
2:25:28

come with hunger. Lift your faith. I want to encourage everyone right now to close their eyes and take a moment with
2:25:40
Jesus. Maybe what what kind of Christian are you?
2:25:47
What kind of Christian are you?
2:25:53
I want you to to really think about what kind of Christian you are. Are you lukewarm?
2:26:00
Are you being a good Christian, closing doors, but haven't stood firmly with God
2:26:08
and accepted him in all of his ways? accepted his move, his power, his
2:26:15
revival, his servants. Have you been a Pharisee? Have you kept
2:26:20
a Pharisee tendency in you? If I if you're any of these types of Christians
2:26:26
in any way, I I encourage you to surrender to God and make the choice
2:26:32
today to s to surrender everything to Jesus and to step firmly in his will and
2:26:38
stand firmly with God. Just speak from your hearts right now to God right now.
2:26:45
Just speak to him. whatever he's leading you to repent of,
2:26:51
just speak to him from your heart. And if you need freedom or healing, I I I
2:26:57
encourage you to surrender to God with however he wants to touch you right now, with however he wants to deliver you.
2:27:04
That it would be his will and not your will.
