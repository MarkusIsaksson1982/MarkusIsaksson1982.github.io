0:06
Where's my phone? My phone. Lily has my phone.
0:11
Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah.
0:17
My phone.
0:24
[Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
0:33
Hallelujah. Revival is now. Praise God. Praise God. What an amazing
0:41
day the Lord has made. Amen. We will rejoice in this day that the Lord has made and be glad in it. This is
0:49
a an amazing day that the Lord has made in revival where God is going to move in power and do many miracles and bring
0:56
freedom and healing and impartation and the baptism of the Holy Spirit and baptism in water spontaneously is going
1:04
to happen today. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Are you ready? Are you excited?
1:10
Hallelujah. Um first of all, just a couple announcements. We do have Are the sheets here yet? And towels
1:16
on their way. They're on their way. So, at some point, we're going to be having sheets sheets coming so that you can sit
1:23
down if you'd like cuz we're having a full service here. Hallelujah.
1:29
And we have we've purchased a whole bunch of towels and big dark t-shirts
1:36
cuz I know some of you want to be baptized, but you weren't prepared for this spontaneous baptism. So, they're on
1:42
their way. So, um, once the the the sheets get here, you can look around and sit down if you want to sit down. Um,
1:49
first of all, thank you so much for being flexible with the Holy Spirit today. Thank you. So, yeah, the serving
1:58
team was there ready to serve this morning at 10:00 a.m. and and we they were just alerted then that there was an
2:05
issue with the AC at the Velasco Theater and there was a crane in there working on it right there, but we were not
2:11
allowed to go in because of that issue. So, we're here.
2:17
Hallelujah. And and God only allows things to happen
2:23
when he intends it for good. When he the Bible says in in this
2:30
scripture, he just kept speaking this to me today over and over again that man
2:35
makes their plans. Man makes his plans, woman makes his plans, people make their plans, but the Lord directs our steps.
2:45
And so the Lord has directed our steps today. I know that for one, the reason we are here today is because people are
2:53
going to be baptized today that need to be baptized today. There are people that God knows it's their time. Today is the
3:00
day and it's going to be so powerful. It's going to be so miraculous what happens when you go in the water. Those
3:07
of you that are going to be baptized, it's time to shed the past. Your past self, the way the devil's been hunting
3:14
you of your past, the way these bombarding thoughts have been coming up of your past, they're going to be left
3:20
in the water. Yes. All these residual ways that have been creeping back in in your life, in
3:28
your mind, they're going to be in the water and gone and dead. The old you is going to be dead today. And you are
3:33
going to rise with Christ, a new creation, new life. That's why God calls us to be baptized in the water because
3:40
this is a prophetic symbol of what happens in the spirit when you give your
3:45
life to Jesus. The Bible says that you are crucified, co-rcified with Christ.
3:52
And when you come out of the water, that's symbolic of you being co-resen with Jesus. Hallelujah. Praise God. So
4:00
that's for one. And another thing God told me today as I was on the car on the way here, the Lord spoke this to me. He
4:05
said, "Today I wanted you to visit the stones, the memorial stones."
4:12
The memorial stones of where revival broke out. Revival broke out outside
4:18
and revival broke. This is so powerful. Glory to God. You know this plan the
4:25
Holy Spirit gave us just an hour ago about. We sent um we sent uh uh uh Steve and
4:33
Weston. They went to Guitar Center and purchased this and this and do you know that this is the exact I still this is
4:39
the exact one that I purchased at Guitar Center back in when we went out to the
4:44
park in 2021. Now it's some it's it's back at Jean Tall's place. You saw it in her garage, but that's too far to drive.
4:52
So, we got a new one. But and we might have to move it. Yeah, let's move it actually. Oh, Lord. because the water's
4:58
coming up just in time. The Lord directed us to notice this speaker. Thank you, Lord.
5:04
Thank you, Jesus. Wow. Hallelujah. Thank you, Holy Spirit.
5:10
But yeah, um God says, you know, Josh Joshua in the times of Joshua and I went
5:16
God's been speaking so much about the Joshua generation. How we're the Joshua generation, how we're going into the promised land. We are already stepped
5:22
into the promised land of revival, but we are bringing revival all over the world. this generation, global revival,
5:27
end time revival. We are the Joshua generation. Hallelujah. And it was in Joshua's time where God where where God
5:34
parted the waters for them. And he commanded them to set down memorial
5:40
stones as a remembrance of that miracle that God did there.
5:46
And so God calls us to do that in the spirit today to set memorial stones to
5:53
remember. If we don't do this, we'll forget. If we don't set something to remember, we'll forget. We'll take for
5:58
granted what God has done for us. We won't value what God has done for us. And we won't remember how faithful he
6:04
is, what he did in the past. Remember last Sunday, I was saying I I shared with you, we you have to remember what
6:10
God has done for you. You have to remember or you won't make it into the promised land. And so the Lord was speaking to me today that part
6:16
of the reason why this is how the Holy Spirit led us today was when we are outside whenever we are
6:22
meeting outside this is our this is our time of returning to the memorial stones. Amen. Of remembrance remembering what God did
6:30
how revival broke out. Amen. Hallelujah. So, for those of you that
6:36
don't know the story, for those of you that don't know the story, um God had spoken that revival is now for America,
6:43
that it was going to spread across the world. It was going to start in LA. It was going to spread across the US and across the whole world. This was through
6:48
my spiritual father, Prophet Joe Davy, in 2017. And he he prophesied this and
6:54
God had called me to start Five-fold Church um uh a little bit before this, a
7:00
few months before this. So we started this we started I started Felful Church a few months before we started out on a
7:05
mountaintop outside. So we began outside and um actually that is when that is
7:13
when I believe I got this actually I I do believe not this exact one but this
7:19
is a new one today but this same exact Bose speaker. And um a couple months later we had church inside. We were
7:25
renting a space. We were having in a kind of a gym area, senior activity center at Pam Pacific Park. That's where
7:31
we were most of the time. We were at different places, but we were there for a couple years having church every
7:36
Sunday. And we got smaller each year from 20 to 15 to 10 to 5 down to just
7:44
two of us, Jall and I in 2020 when COVID hit at times, just the two of us. But we
7:49
decreased for about 4 years. And oh, by the way, we have sunscreen, too. If
7:55
anybody needs sunscreen, go to the beach. We don't want anyone to get burnt. Go to the beach, uh, the middle
8:00
area to get sunscreen. Hallelujah. And so, we decreased each year, but I but I
8:06
knew that God had spoken, "Revival is now." I knew that that word was true,
8:12
but it looked like the opposite. It looked like the opposite of revival breaking out. But we kept declaring,
8:17
"Revival is now." John Paul and I wrote that song in the summer July 4th. What
8:22
was it? 2018 was it? Or 2019? 2019. We wrote Revival is now when our church had
8:29
just five to seven people in it coming each Sunday. 2019.
8:34
And um we would sing it all the time. That song kept believing that God's word
8:40
must come to pass. Amen. And of course, you picture what it's going to look like. You make your plans
8:46
in your mind of how revival is going to break out. You know, and I remember when I found the venue we were having church
8:52
at at the Pam Pacific Park. It was a gym space, an auditorium gym space. I remember when I went in there at the
8:58
time, we had 15 10 people. But I said, "This is perfect because Revival is going to break out. We're going to need
9:04
a massive venue. So, this gym is going to be perfect. It's massive." And so,
9:09
every week I we would set up two We would set up more chairs than we needed. We would set up like way more chairs.
9:16
Three times as many chairs many times. like 30 or something chairs and we would set down the connection cards, the
9:22
offering envelopes, and and then we'd pick them all up again at the end of service, most of them, because it was
9:28
just a few handful of people that would come. And sometimes those chairs would
9:34
yell at us. It felt like like the empty chairs, but we kept believing. We kept
9:39
believing God's word that that his word would not fail and we
9:44
would see it come to pass. So I pictured I pictured that that this gym was going
9:52
to be filled one day and you know that never happened but it happened in a much
9:57
better way. This revival breaking out it happened in a much better way. What happened was in 2020
10:04
co hit so we could no longer rent the gym space auditorium space we were
10:10
having church in. We could no longer rent it. They wouldn't allow us to have church there. So, it was like, "Oh, no.
10:15
What will we do? We We can't have church anymore." Well, the Lord the Lord spoke
10:20
to me. I'm moving outside of the box now. Take my church outside.
10:27
And so, we went outside with this Bose speaker and just this
10:33
same simple setup and we had church service twice a week most of the time,
10:38
Fridays and Sundays. And do you know that instantly I was filled with e such
10:45
more joy in the park than in the building because
10:50
all of a sudden people they were starting to they were going for jog or they were just walking in the park and they would come and they would sit down
10:57
and then I would pray for them and the Lord would speak to them through a prophetic word and they would start crying. They would be touched and I was
11:04
so full of joy because that would happen at our church before and when we were in the building but only like once a month
11:10
one new person would come and they would be touched by God that you you would see them be touched by God
11:16
but usually they wouldn't come back and it was like once a month we would be so blessed to see the Holy Spirit moving in
11:23
power is with someone new coming for example because as I've explained before
11:29
um the the wind wind, earthquake, and fire moments are not supposed to be all the time, right? So that's why, you
11:37
know, the Holy Spirit was moving, but we weren't seeing the manifest power of God
11:42
every week. And at this point, we hadn't even seen deliverance yet or healing yet. But when we were in the park,
11:48
sometimes 10 people would come, sometimes 20 people would come. And I remember there was just this
11:55
breakthrough as soon as we we were going out in the park for years. We were decreasing every
12:01
week. Now we're seeing people come. They didn't return usually, but it would be
12:07
10 people, 20 people, 25 people. And each time people will be touched so mightily by God through prophetic words.
12:14
And I just remember so vividly going for a hike one time and just praising God. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for bringing
12:21
people. Thank you that people are being touched by your power. Thank you, Jesus.
12:27
I mean, this was such breakthrough. And so already it seemed like going outside
12:32
was like going backwards but we were experiencing revival like we hadn't before. We were experienc more
12:39
experiencing more people coming. We were experiencing the power of God moving more immediately. I remember that season
12:45
I was so full of joy. And it was like the first time I felt such contentness
12:51
in that deep wilderness place was when we followed the Holy Spirit in such an
12:57
unconventional way, uncomfortable way, humbling way, outside of the box way.
13:03
That's when there was this breakthrough even before revival broke out in 2021. And this part I don't share that much,
13:08
but I'm sharing this with you now. I'm just I'm saying like when we follow when you follow the Holy Spirit, it it's
13:14
uncomfortable sometimes because you have your plans and that you want these plans to happen and they seem like good plans
13:20
and many times we go by logic which God is not many times usually in logic and
13:26
but we have these plans and we pray for them. We ask God, God, I believe you will do this. Where what we ask and
13:32
believe in, we will receive. The Bible says, which is true. But sometimes God
13:37
is just God confounds us with a better plan
13:43
than what we have. Man makes his plans, but the Lord directs our steps.
13:51
Hallelujah. And as you grow in the in the wisdom of the Lord, as you grow in the wisdom of
13:58
the Lord, truly, you are making wise decisions. The plans you have are good.
14:03
They're not bad. It's not like, oh, they're inside of the box and safe. I don't mean that. As you grow in the
14:09
wisdom of the Lord, you can make really good plans that that are godly and good.
14:16
But sometimes God is just God and wants to show that he is God. wants to
14:22
confound us, wants to humble us, and wants to confound the world. Not just
14:27
us, not just humbling us, but confounding the world. Like, you know how revival broke out in the park that
14:34
just is for the glory of God. Hallelujah. You know, I mean, even how videos started to go so viral, I believe so
14:41
much is part of it because it was so shocking. Yeah. It was so shocking. How can this be?
14:47
Right. Right. We we we r we rarely see deliverance today and the power of God move today in
14:53
the church, but we're seeing it now in the park with this little setup.
14:59
It it's so shocking. It makes people even drawn more like this has to be God, you know?
15:07
So that's sometimes why why God's plans don't really make sense to us and are
15:14
not what we had planned for, not what we would have thought would be best,
15:20
the highest standard of excellence for God and etc. and predictable. That's why. And so um
15:29
God brought us here to remember what he's done. Every time I I I minister outside, like we've had baptism services
15:35
here before, and every time I'm out here, I can't help but go back in my
15:41
mind to that place where God made those walls of Jericho come down that I had
15:47
been believing in for many years and made revival to break out.
15:55
This is our these are our memorial stones. Thanking God, remembering what he has done. Thank you, Jesus. So today
16:01
is a day where God wanted us to remember what he has done. How far he has taken
16:06
us, how far this revival has grown and to remember that he is Lord
16:12
and we he is our leader. Holy Spirit is our leader.
16:18
[Music] Going back to the story, um
16:24
well I I wanted to share you know it's so important that you follow God when he takes you outside of the box. when you
16:29
follow him, when he has different plans than the plans you made because this spiritually even is a breakthrough for
16:35
you. Like I I I I was actually reflecting on it recently. I was like, "What?" I remember in 2020 when the rest
16:43
of the world was depressed. I remember in 2020 there was this
16:49
breakthrough for me before every year I was thinking like, "Oh, I hope revival
16:55
come breaks out this year. Oh, every every like January 1st, I just I wanted
17:00
it to the depths of my heart to the point that it was uncomfortable and it was almost discontentment. You know, you know when you want the
17:06
promises of God so bad and but God calls us to be content still. He
17:13
wants us to be hungry, but we have to be content. We cannot just be hungry. And so, I remember every year for about 3
17:18
years, every year I was just hungry and not the most content. I wasn't depressed. Praise God. I kept trusting
17:25
and believing God and kept humbling myself and that kept me in a place of content, but it wasn't full contentment.
17:32
The hunger was overpowering the contentment lots of times. But when 2020 hit, there was breakthrough and I felt
17:38
so content all of a sudden. I felt like whenever revival breaks out, that's
17:45
cool. For the first time, I felt like okay with God's plans if it's going to
17:50
take longer. I You know how like it's hard for you to really verbalize that? You're like, "Yes." In your mind, like,
17:55
"I just want God's will." But I finally got to that place where I was like, "Yes, Lord." Even if it's several years,
18:01
that's okay. I'm okay with it. Let your will be done. I I felt that
18:06
deep in my heart for the first time in 2020 when we had gone down to two people
18:11
with this simple setup outside. And I was meditating on it recently, actually, just just a just a couple the past week,
18:18
I think, in preparation for this message, I do believe now. But I was I was I was meditating. Why was I so
18:25
content all of a sudden? Like why? Like what happened? And this is what it was. It was the Holy
18:31
Spirit. Whenever he moves outside of the box, there's a great grace there. There's a great grace. Whenever you're
18:36
in God's will. And so when it's time to shift, it's exciting. When God says go here, go a different way. It means
18:43
you're closer to the promised land. It mean you're going there for a good reason. Not just because. Not just cuz
18:48
God's like go here just for no reason. There's a purpose. It's a new level. It's even a reward.
18:55
You think you think about you think about Joseph. You think about Joseph when he was thrown into prison. When he
19:02
was thrown into prison, um it was because they believed that he was was
19:08
making sexual advances on uh uh uh Pharaoh's wife. And um so people believe
19:14
the false accusations and threw him in jail. But that was his place of breakthrough. That was his place in the
19:20
jail was where he needed to be positioned where God would make the promise be fulfilled because he
19:27
interpreted the dreams of people who were in the prison with him. And then one of the guys he interpreted the
19:32
dreams to was true. It happened. And then all of a sudden, God gave Pharaoh this disturbing dream. It disturbed him
19:38
so much. He was restless. He needed to have his dream interpreted. and and and
19:44
the guy that had his dream interpreted in the prison, he's like, "Well, I know somebody who really hears from God.
19:50
God's grace is on his life. You need him. You need God moving through him, the anointing on his life."
19:57
And so he said, "Okay." He pulls him out of the prison. He interprets Pharaoh's dream. And he interpreted true. The
20:04
Pharaoh could tell it was God speaking through him. And that led him to see the grace on his life, the anointing, the
20:10
wisdom that was going to benefit and bless Pharaoh. So Pharaoh then promotes him to the very highest position besides
20:18
Pharaoh, which was the dream, the promise that God gave Joseph years ago.
20:26
So you see, it was outside of the box. It was not what Joseph would have planned to see the dream come to pass.
20:32
And it was uncomfortable. It was not fun to be in the prison. It was it was very
20:38
not uh it sometimes the will of God is not fun. It was not fun but that was his place of breakthrough. That was the
20:44
place the promise was fulfilled. Hallelujah.
20:51
And so the Lord was speaking to me. He's like he spoke to me how by me being flexible and by by me being
20:59
flexible and following him outside of the box in this place that was humbling in this place that felt like we're going
21:04
backwards. just by me following him there. It was an immediate breakthrough for me personally even before revival
21:10
broke out. It was a supernatural uh breakthrough of peace of joy that just
21:16
supernaturally happened by following God outside in his will outside of the box.
21:23
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's the grace of God's will. You know
21:28
the Israelites they they they followed the cloud. God was in the cloud
21:34
by day and a pillar of fire at night. And so imagine during imagine during the
21:40
day when they follow, not only are they getting perfect direction, they don't have to worry or fret. Are we in God's
21:46
will or not? Not only that, but they were sheltered from the heat of the sun
21:51
with that cloud. There was this great blessing beyond being in the perfect will of God in the
21:56
direction. But there was a grace, a blessing upon their lives with that cloud
22:02
sheltering them from the sun. And at night time, the the pillar of fire, it would have been cold at night in the desert, but that fire would have kept
22:08
them warm. Not only did it guide them, but it kept them warm. Hallelujah.
22:14
Hallelujah. Praise God. Praise God. It says um Isaiah 55:8, "For
22:23
my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, says the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your
22:29
ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. His ways are better. His ways are
22:34
higher. You know, we grow in the Lord and we become more like him. We have the mind of Christ. The Holy Spirit's within
22:40
us. But there is still that separation of creation and God. Amen. Creation and
22:48
God. God always wants us to stay humble. So we're never going to have like the
22:54
exact mind of God. We will always need to depend on him and seek him. So yes,
23:00
he transforms us. So we're just naturally walking with the Holy Spirit, but sometimes he will boom confound us
23:05
and saying, "Surprise! We're going to the beach today."
23:10
People are going to get baptized today in fire and in the water. Surprise!
23:16
Hallelujah. And I'm so expectant for what God's going to do today.
23:22
because of that it it it means and and and also whenever it a reward it's a reward of do it's uncomfortable to go
23:29
outside of the box so he gives you a reward he gives you a reward reward more of his spirit more
23:35
blessing I've seen him do this every time and now it was it was the spring of 2021
23:44
we have been having church in the park now for I don't know from from from July 31st
23:52
So, it's about the anniversary of when we first started having services outside, July 31st. From July 31st until
24:00
um May 21st. That was the period of having church outside before the first
24:05
demon was cast out. So, the first demon that was cast out at Five-fold Church
24:12
was with a simple setup like this outside in the park with just a few
24:17
people. And that woman was set free by God's power. Hallelujah. And a video of
24:23
her deliverance went massively viral immediately. And people started flocking. People started traveling
24:30
pretty much every single week since that since then to come and encounter God's power and to experience revival. A
24:36
couple months after that, May 30th, 2021, we went from 80 people the
24:42
previous week. We kept growing from that first deliverance from 20some people. May 20 20 May sorry March 21st 20ome
24:49
people we grew to 80 the mid midmay 2 months later and the next week 300
24:55
people came the amphitheater was literally overflowing when that September there was just one person I
25:01
was preaching to and they left in the middle of the service onund something degree day and look what God did in that
25:09
short amount of time and this revival has kept growing since then we've had people traveling every single week from
25:15
around the the country and around the world since that summer every single week to be here and encounter God's
25:21
power to experience revival. Hallelujah. But this great promise was fulfilled in
25:27
the most unlikely place. I never in a million years would have guessed that
25:32
that is where the promise would be fulfilled and revival would break out in the park with such a simple setup. I
25:38
would never imagine in a million years that people would like take us as a
25:43
church seriously type thing enough to get in flights to get on a plane
25:50
and travel from all all over the world. I never would have imagined that because I never heard of that. I never heard of
25:56
that. I never imagined. And so God confounded me. He confounded all of us by moving
26:03
outside of the box in a humbling way like Jesus where there was no room for
26:08
him in the end. They said there's no room for you here. But he was born in a manger and God allowed that to happen. God allowed that
26:15
as an example that he can do anything. It doesn't matter. You can be in the manger and salvation will come. You can
26:23
be in the most unlikely places and salvation came. Our savior came in the most humble and lowly of places.
26:31
And so in the most humble and lowly of places, God moves today. Still, this is what humbles us as well. This is what
26:37
humbles us. Um the more that God humbles me, the more that that that um I go
26:44
through obstacles and I get humbling in that, I find that
26:50
I I'm less entitled. I'm less entitled.
26:56
Because as I go through uncomfortable situations, as I go through rejection,
27:02
as I go through waiting and continuing to believe in the promise of God, and
27:07
this is today, too, promises that haven't come past yet, the more I I have to make that choice. You can either you
27:13
can go one way or the other. You can either get bitter and resent God and give up or you can just simply keep on
27:21
obeying God, keep having the childlike faith. Two options. And by the grace of God,
27:27
I've chose the second option. And I've kept choosing nothing matters but obedience. Nothing matters but
27:33
obedience. I must obey God. His timing is perfect. I trust him. And the more that you do it, it it builds faith in
27:40
you. It builds patience. It builds your Christlike character, it builds the
27:46
fruits of the spirit. That's why things don't happen fast. God needs things to build in you.
27:52
Hallelujah. So, every time things have not gone gone how I thought they should, how I'd like
27:58
for them to, and I said, "Oh, I really thought this would happen. Why didn't this happen?" God had something else in
28:04
planned. He had a different timeline planned. But it humbled me. It made me
28:09
to see God's ways are best. I've just got to trust him. Things haven't happened yet. Well, God's time is best.
28:16
It's just not God's timing yet. Tim timing yet. As simple as that. And so, it is beautiful to follow the Holy
28:23
Spirit when he goes outside of your plans. It is beautiful because it
28:30
produces the most precious thing in you ever. The heart of Christ, the fruits of the Holy Spirit, humility.
28:38
Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
28:44
It says in John 3:8, "As the wind's blowing right now," this verse says, "the wind blows where it wishes
28:54
and you hear you hear the sound of it, but you cannot tell where it comes from
28:59
and where it goes." So is everyone who is born of the spirit.
29:06
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So this is our life with the Holy
29:12
Spirit. And we must remember this because sometimes there will be seasons where it's like God saying to do one
29:19
thing, go here. Go here. We're going on this straight line. And it's it can be for months. It can be for years that
29:24
this is the direction of God. And you can get so used to that and you can forget that God is like the wind. And
29:33
God might make a sharp left or sharp right suddenly. He's like the wind and he's the God of suddenly
29:42
where he changes everything in one instant. That is our God.
29:48
So you got to be you got to remember that in order to follow the Holy Spirit,
29:53
you have to be flexible. You have to adapt. You have to be ready for him to do something suddenly. For him to change
29:59
your life completely in one second. for the past season to just be gone all of a sudden before you had had a chance to be
30:04
prepared for that season to pass. You have to be prepared to do something you don't want to do, do something uncomfortable, do something not fun. You
30:11
have to be ready. You have to have that spirit of readiness and be flexible.
30:16
Amen. This is where God's grace comes. This is the only place God's grace comes. God's
30:22
grace is only in his will. If you want the blessings of God's will, you have to
30:28
be flexible. You have to go in the valleys. When he says go in the valleys,
30:35
you have to be okay with that in your heart. These are the people God can use the most powerfully are those who will
30:42
let go of their plans and be flexible and go wherever God wants them to go. Amen.
30:47
Um I've I've you know ex following the Holy
30:53
Spirit the way I me following the Holy Spirit how it's looked for me many times is um like
31:00
God will say God will God will God will say don't go through this door because it's not mine but it seems like a good
31:07
door you know man's doors
31:12
you don't need to make connections here and connections here that could lead to doors opening cuz that's not my door opening up ahead there. Don't make
31:18
connections there. Wow. It It looks like Don't appease people.
31:24
What you do is going to offend them. The way you minister is going to offend them. The way you preach is going to offend them. The way you pray for
31:30
people, the way you cast out demons is going to offend them. The way you honor people, the way you honor, you honor where honor is deserved. The way you
31:36
honor your spiritual father, the way you preach the new wine, it's
31:41
going to offend a lot of people. And it's going to cause a lot of people to close doors in your face.
31:49
But I want you to only follow me. And I will open up doors that no man can shut.
31:57
And those are the doors that I want to go through. And they're going to take longer sometimes. They do take longer
32:02
sometimes. But it's so worth it. Because God's doors come with supernatural grace that the world can
32:08
never give you. They come with a supernatural joy the world can never give you. And they and they come with
32:14
the anointing. This is one of the big keys of how I've seen the anointing move by the grace of
32:21
God in my life in this ministry is by following strictly following God's
32:28
ways only. Which means saying no to man's ways, logic ways, pleasing people
32:35
ways, conventional ways, comfortable ways, things that make sense ways. It
32:40
means saying no to those and it means waiting on God. It means
32:46
having to be patient. But it is so worth it.
32:51
[Music] And this is God's calling for all of you. This is God's calling for all of you.
32:57
Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Um this revival has so much grace of God on
33:05
it because we are following the leading of the Holy Spirit.
33:10
And it doesn't matter what kind of persecution comes. It doesn't matter what anybody says. Nobody can stop this
33:17
revival. No, nobody can stop this revival. Nobody can stop this move. But it's but it's
33:25
only when we stay in God's will. It's only when we let him be Lord, Lord of this revival, leader of this revival,
33:32
master of this revival. As long as we will do that, we are walking in the
33:37
supernatural grace of God where there is victory after victory
33:43
after victory after victory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
33:50
This is part of how we are the light of the world also is when we follow God's will because people start to see it in
33:56
your life. This is how the supernatural grace and favor is seen upon your life. People they see something different
34:02
about you. They see favor on your life that they don't have. It's because you are following the Holy Spirit. You are
34:09
strict to follow the Holy Spirit. And there's a supernatural flow of grace over you always.
34:17
Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Holy Spirit. So
34:24
this is um this is as a revival army. This is muscles that God is building in
34:30
you all the time today. He's building in you
34:35
flexible adaptable muscles, stretching you.
34:42
Stretching you so that you are ready to go to to make a quick turn. when he says
34:48
make a quick turn to do the splits when he says to do the splits
34:54
to do a ballet move when that you will be able you you won't be lagging you
34:59
won't be left behind you won't be saying ow this hurts so much you are agile
35:07
you're ready you're ready you're ready to pivot wherever God goes wherever God takes us
35:15
and this is the muscles that it's not just for the a leader. This is this is an army.
35:21
This is how revival expands is through through his army. So he is building these muscles in you.
35:27
If you ever find a time where of disappointment, maybe you're praying for
35:32
something and it didn't happen, you need to understand this. The Bible says that
35:38
whatever you ask for and believe in your heart that it will happen, it will come to pass. God will do it.
35:47
But remember, at the same time, we make plans, but God directs our steps.
35:52
Remember, at the same time, God's ways are higher than our ways. So,
35:58
there's going to be many things that you pray for that is going to be prompted by the Holy Spirit that God absolutely
36:04
wants to happen this exact way. You know, maybe you're finding an obstacle, you're finding stagnancy, and you you
36:11
pray, you ask God, and you declare breakthrough, you declare provision, you declare this specific door to open, for
36:17
example. And that's what he is is speaking. And and that happens. It happens. Exactly. But there'll be other
36:23
times where God's like, "Time to confound you. Time to humble you.
36:30
You're going to make your plan and you're going to think it's a good one." And it there's nothing wrong with it. It's not like it's ungodly, but I'm
36:36
going to confound you. It's time. It's stretching time. It's stretching time.
36:42
It's time for you to go flexible with me. I'm going to catch you off guard. So, you need to know that when you're in
36:48
surrender to God, whatever you ask for, you will receive when it's God's will.
36:54
When it's God's will. But sometimes things won't happen because it's not his timing or he has a
37:00
different way that he wants to bring it. So, we have to have we it's important to
37:06
not get disappointed in those times. It's important you have that mature understanding. No, God, why didn't you answer my
37:12
prayer? But he didn't let you down. He had He had something better planned. Or if you
37:18
haven't seen it come through yet, you need to know immediately God's ways are higher. He has something better than
37:24
this great plan that I had and prayed for. He has something better.
37:30
Amen. And sometimes it's that it's just not the timing yet. And God's building
37:36
something in you that's so precious that you need. You need for later to fulfill your purpose. And that's the scripture. It
37:43
says, "All things work out for good for those who are called according to his
37:48
purpose. All things work out for good." So God allows some things to happen. You don't
37:54
understand why, but he has a plan how he's working this out. Perhaps it's that it's part of your refining fire. Perhaps
38:00
is that he's building patience, building faith, he's building flexible muscles in you. Perhaps perhaps it's something you
38:07
don't even realize. Perhaps it's something like this that God has this special plan to that when he that when
38:13
people become baptized today, he's going to do something so supernatural in that that he needed to do in the water
38:19
through the baptism instead of in the church. Or perhaps as we are in this season of acceptance, perhaps there is a
38:26
harvest on the beach right now and people are going to come and start hearing the word and become saved.
38:32
Perhaps God loves somebody so much who is at the beach for a beach day today to go swimming that he brought the church
38:39
to them. Hallelujah. Perhaps there's going to be a divine
38:45
many divine appointments here. You're going to you have flyers. You're going to evangelize to people after the service and people are going to be
38:51
saved, healed, and delivered as God moves through you as a vessel. Perhaps perhaps this is the mind we must have.
38:59
This mind of childlike trust. God's ways are best. I don't have to understand
39:04
what his ways are right now in this moment, but I trust he's in control.
39:10
Something that I've learned that's so important is whenever you're feeling stress, you know, cuz you uh something's
39:17
not working out right, the door's not opening, time's running out, how are you going to pay for the bill, whatever it
39:23
is, stop stressing because what you're doing when you're stressing is forgetting that
39:29
God sees, that God loves you, that God has a plan way better than
39:35
yours, that God cares about you being able to pay your bill more than you do or whatever. Whatever it is, he cares about
39:42
whatever you need more than you do. He loves you more than you love yourself.
39:47
Nobody can love you, even yourself, the way God loves you. When whenever you're stressing, you're
39:53
forgetting God sees and loves you and has a plan. You should make this practice the next
39:59
time you start stressing, the next time you start worrying, the next time you start feeling like you want to cry with the the cuz you're worried and the
40:06
pressure of something not happening, nothing happening yet. Renew your mind immediately. I'm forgetting that God
40:12
loves me and that God sees and that God's in control and he has a plan. I'm forgetting that God is my provider. And
40:20
start confessing, God, I trust you. I thank you, God, that you your ways are better than mine and you're providing for me right now. I thank you, Lord,
40:26
that your hand is upon my life right now. I thank you, God, that you care about this situation more than I do. I
40:31
thank you, God. I worship you. I trust you. The plans you have for me are good. plans to give me a hope and a future.
40:38
This is one of the most powerful things you can do that will please God is to catch yourself the moment you start to
40:44
stress. Renew your mind with this and start confessing the truth and praising God.
40:51
Amen. It pleases God. It pleases God when you do that. We don't need to stress. That's
40:57
why God says, "Why do you worry even for a day? Why do you worry even for a second? You're wasting time. What does it add to your life?"
41:04
I pray you get this in your mind that any second you are worrying, you are
41:09
wasting time. Any second you are stressing, you are wasting time. You
41:14
could be at peace. You could be having joy. You can be worshiping God, enjoying life.
41:20
Because God's in control of your life. Period. Simple. Be childlike, children of God. Be childlike. Amen.
41:28
Amen. What God intended for evil or sorry what the devil intended for evil,
41:34
God intended for good. Even when it seems like such evil
41:40
things are happening.
42:00
And the promise will be fulfilled no
42:06
matter what. Hallelujah.
42:11
Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you,
42:17
Jesus. Our God is so good. He's so powerful. I think one of the biggest
42:22
things that believers are missing is
42:28
is remembering just how powerful he is in your personal life.
42:34
just how in control he is and just how good his plans are for you.
42:41
And so I pray that you will I pray maybe can you see maybe me as a testimony or a
42:47
fivefold church even the things that we've went through, the things that we've gone through, but
42:53
I'm in awe of God's faithfulness. Week after week, month after month, year after year, I look back and I stand in
43:01
awe. I pray your eyes will open up today of the faithfulness of God.
43:07
His ways won't make sense to you some lots of times. I'm telling you, they won't make sense, but they don't need to
43:14
make sense. You're called to be childlike and just trust. Amen.
43:21
I pray you will trust God more than ever. You will be you will be adventurous with
43:27
the Holy Spirit. you would be adventurous like run to the beach in your church clothes.
43:34
This is a this is a practice here for you. This is a flexible training here.
43:39
Stretching gym the gym. We're going to the gym. You know, church is about being equipped.
43:45
The the church going to church is about being equipped. So today you you better
43:50
you better be making sure every single day you have your your gym clothes on
43:55
in the spiritual realm. Here we are. Get ready to work your muscles every time you go to church.
44:02
Every time you listen to the word of God, you're not there to relax on the couch when you come to church. When you listen
44:08
to the word of God, be ready to be active in the spirit. Be ready to be stretched, get uncomfortable
44:14
a little bit, sweat, you're going you're so your muscles might be sore a little bit after, but
44:20
that's good. Amen. It means you're getting stronger. Hallelujah.
44:27
Hallelujah. Praise God. Wow. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
44:34
Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Praise God. Well, um I want I want us to take a
44:42
moment right now just to thank God and to give to God. Um just to to to thank him in action right
44:49
now. I don't know. Do we have uh do we have offering buckets? You do? Okay.
44:56
So maybe some ushers can pass them around. Um if you'd like to give online, you can go to fivefchurch.org/give.
45:03
You can go to um the link in my bio if you're watching online. But I want right now we're going to give thanks to God in
45:09
an action. And um every time you give to God, it's a spiritual thing that's taking place. Every time you give to
45:16
God, he releases something to you in the spiritual realm. Many times it's also physical things like resources like
45:22
financial resources, but it's also always spiritual, something you're receiving. And so I see right now as you
45:30
give to God, there is a special grace and anointing coming upon you that's
45:35
going to help you grow, that's going to help you become stronger, that's going to help you become flexible, that's
45:40
going to get you out of that comfortable place in the spiritual realm. Amen.
45:45
Hallelujah. So if you need an envelope, you can just raise your hand. But I want to just declare over all of you right
45:51
now where you are. I want to declare over you all. Lift your seed or your hands right now. Thank you, Jesus.
46:00
Upon every one of these seeds, I speak right now for doors to open in their
46:06
lives. Breakthrough, doors of breakthrough, doors of increase. And I speak unexpected miracles, unexpected
46:12
provision, unexpected breakthrough. Let this come upon your life. Let you be
46:18
confounded by your God with how he comes through in a way you didn't expect in a
46:23
way that was miraculous. May these blessings come upon your life and let faith in God increase with what
46:31
God does now in with with this increase in your life. Let there be no lack in your life anymore in any area, but let
46:38
there be continual abundance in Jesus name. Amen.
46:44
Hallelujah. Praise God. Thank you, Jesus.
46:50
Well, I want to encourage you all right now. I'm going to be praying for everyone right now. God's going to deliver and heal anybody who needs
46:55
freedom or healing. I just met someone in the bathroom that said they came from Texas uh to to receive freedom,
47:03
believing God for freedom. Hallelujah. So, I know that there are many of you who have traveled a long ways to receive
47:09
freedom and healing from Jesus, to receive all that he has for you. So, I
47:14
want to encourage you to stand up right now and position yourselves all all right now in the position of receiving
47:20
from God. God has something for every single one of you right now in the spiritual realm.
47:27
Thank you, Jesus.
47:35
Thank you.
47:44
Thank you, Jesus. And I want to uh I want to invite everyone right now to close your eyes and take a moment with
47:50
Jesus. I know God has spoken to you through this word through to many of you. And I know some people are feeling,
47:58
some of you are feeling convicted right now that you've been resistant. Whenever God doesn't come through in the way you
48:04
wanted him to, maybe you complain, maybe just in your heart, you feel some
48:09
resentment, bitterness, like God let you down or something. But right now, I know
48:14
God's going to be showing a lot of you his faithfulness. Just take a moment with God and look at his faithfulness in
48:21
your life. Look at how he's never let you down. Just just look right now. Remember, look back. What are your
48:28
memorial stones? Look back right now and remember how he has come through you
48:33
through for you every time. Go back to those moments where you didn't know where he was, where you thought he
48:38
wasn't answering your prayers and and remember now how he came through indeed.
48:44
How he came through in ways you never would have expected. Just take a moment and reflect. Take a moment and remember.
48:50
And as you do this, thank God. And as you do this, also speak to God. Repent.
48:56
If you've if you've been someone who complains, if you've been someone who gets upset when things don't go how you
49:03
wanted it to, you you felt disappointment towards towards God. Maybe you even prayed things that were
49:10
were not kind to God. You like saying things like, "God, where why didn't you come through? Why didn't you come
49:15
through?" Things like that. I encourage you to even repent for words like that
49:21
because they're lies. Amen. [Music] I I encourage you right now to just take
49:28
time with God and say sorry for anything that was disrespectful to him
49:34
and just confess your faith in him. Confess right now that he is faithful.
49:41
Confess to him right now that you put your 100% trust in him, not 98%. And that includes when he takes you on a
49:49
turn you didn't expect. Just speak that to God right now.
49:58
Speak from your heart.
50:06
Thank you, Jesus.
50:11
Just lift your hands right now. You can bring the phone closer. the
50:18
Bluetooth just for the music. It the Bluetooth can
50:23
be closer. Thank you, Jesus. I release this power of God upon you all
50:31
right now. And I speak all of this resistance to be flexible
50:37
with God. All of this resistance to be childlike and humble and dependent like
50:44
a child on God. May this be broken off of you now in Jesus' name. And I declare
50:51
any of the bitterness that you have had towards God, it must go from you.
50:58
I declare that the wounds you've had, the trauma you've had from people
51:03
disappointing you, that trauma you've projected towards
51:09
God. Some of you, I speak, if that's you, renounce that. Renounce that trauma of people disappointing you, of parents
51:17
disappointing you, of of pastors, of ministry leaders disappointing you, of
51:22
church hurt, just renounce that now.
51:28
Thank you, Lord. I speak now every demonic spirit, every demonic yoke and bondage that came
51:35
through this trauma of people disappointing you, it must go from you
51:41
now in Jesus' name. Thank you Jesus.
51:47
May all of this heaviness lift off, all of this pride lift off in Jesus name.
51:54
Thank you Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
51:59
And I speak this anointing to come upon you all. A grace to come upon you all to
52:04
be childlike and humble before God. That you would be flexible and adapt
52:10
with God always. That you would be at peace in every circumstance. When it seems like it's not working out,
52:17
something's not working out, when it seems like breakthrough isn't here yet, may you have peace, total peace from now
52:23
in Jesus name. May you grow in the spirit from now in Jesus name to have
52:28
this peace. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Lord. May you I I speak you to
52:35
arise in the spirit to rise up to rise up higher
52:40
higher levels of maturity in Jesus' name.
52:45
Entering into the rest of God always. Thank you Lord. Thank you Jesus. Amen. Come here hun.
52:53
Create kindness shirt. Come here. God is touching you right now. I feel it. Hallelujah. God is touching you.

53:04
delivering you right now. I break every curse of witchcraft off your life now. I
53:10
break every generational curse. And I declare every spirit that came through trauma, through demonic soul ties, every
53:17
spirit speaking against your identity in Christ, I declare all must go.
53:24
now in Jesus name. I receive it.
53:30
Thank you Lord. Thank you Jesus. Be free completely.
53:37
Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. You are free. Hallelujah.

54:08
ask everyone to actually take like five steps backward just cuz I'm we're getting in the water here. We're going to make a little more space.
54:16
[Music]

Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Praise God. Yes. What are you
1:23:31
coming believing for? We went to to church. My wife called
1:23:36
yesterday. She's visiting our son in Arkansas. I said, "Paul, go see Katherine tomorrow." I went to the
1:23:42
church and I saw this sign and I came here. We want this breakthrough. We follow you. We see. We want your boldness, your simplicity, your wisdom,
1:23:50
what God has given you.
1:24:12
And we want the same explosion that happened. We want this anointing. The same thing. I'm a pastor from Brazil. 42
1:24:18
years here fighting for revival, my wife and I. So just this anointing with this
1:24:23
breakthrough that happened in the park with you. We want to help in the parks of Anaheim in Jesus name. That's all we
1:24:29
want. Hallelujah. God is so proud of you. This heart is
1:24:34
humble. This heart God can use. Thank you Jesus. Thank you Lord. I release
1:24:39
this anointing upon you. May the power of God fill you now. And may revival
1:24:46
break out through you and your ministry. Let people be healed and delivered. May they come to Jesus through you. Receive
1:24:53
this fire of the Holy Spirit. Receive this anointing in Jesus name.
1:24:59

Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you Jes. The pastors are coming to

This revival is for all churches. This revival is for all ministries. If
1:25:31
you will be pure in heart and humble yourself and surrender, but God wants it for all.
1:25:37
It says in the Bible, "All who believe, these signs shall follow, they shall cast out demons, that they shall lay
1:25:42
hands on the sick and be healed." That means it's God's will for every believer
1:25:49
to walk in his power. And so I speak this about this revival
1:25:55
and this anointing that moves here. This is for every pastor, minister, everyone
1:26:01

2:27:49
he would likely need surgery uh, for us to have the children and he didn't want
2:27:55
to have surgery and I told him I didn't want to have and if it was in God's will
2:28:00
it would happen. Yeah. And so I was serving um on park in 2020.
