Introduction
0:00
today you shall be free from the disgusting evil voice of condemnation the bible says you shall
0:06
know the truth and the truth shall set you free you will be free today because you know the truth and it says my people perish
0:12
because of lack of knowledge because of lack of understanding many of you have been perishing in this area because you just didn't know today you
0:18
will know the truth and you will be free it says in the bible in romans 8 verse 1
Romans 81
0:24
so now now there is no condemnation for those who belong to
0:32
christ jesus i like you joining along i think everybody should join along let's say that again let's get this in us right
0:38
now let's speak this truth so there is now no condemnation for
0:44
those who belong to christ jesus it doesn't say there's just not as much
0:50
it says there is no zero none for those who belong to christ
0:56
jesus so that means that if you believe that jesus is your savior
1:02
if you've accepted him as your lord and savior into your life by speaking with your lips jesus you are lord i give you
1:09
my life that's all you have to do some variation of saying it because what counts is your heart
1:14
not religious dictations amen but if you believe and speak with your heart jesus
1:21
i give you my life i believe you are my lord you belong to jesus
1:27
boom as simple as that you've become a child of god you belong to him if that's you
1:35
everybody here today then there is no condemnation for you so that means that
1:41
every kind of thought in your head every kind of voice in your head of
1:47
condemnation it means it's from the devil god can convict you god can god
1:52
can speak to you god can correct you but he will never condemn
1:57
you never so therefore you should never condemn yourself if you
2:03
are ever condemning yourself that means that you are agreeing with the devil
2:08
speaking condemnation to you one of the devil's biggest strategies to keep you
2:14
from knowing god's love and walking in god's power
2:19
is to speak the voice of condemnation to you hoping you'll believe it's god speaking
2:26
it to you and or hoping you'll believe it's your original thought and it's truth like
2:32
i'm bad i condemn myself god's probably mad at me god's
2:37
just probably disappointed in me i i'm so bad i'm such a bad person i'm
2:42
not a good enough christian i don't do enough i don't read the bible enough i don't pray enough that's all condemning
2:48
by the way the devil speaks this the war is in your mind and he's been at war with humanity with
2:54
this same voice of condemnation since the beginning with adam and eve in the beginning with adam eve when they disobeyed god the next thing he did was
3:02
drive condemnation in them they immediately saw they were naked the meaning that they saw they were naked
3:08
means that they had shame like i need to cover myself they didn't know what naked
3:13
was before then and that's why god says who told you you were naked
3:19
the meaning of that is you had no condemnation in you before you saw my love rightly for you and we
3:26
were so intimate you didn't see that you were naked you were bare before me you weren't afraid that i was going to judge
3:32
you or condemn you you were bare naked before me and didn't even know you were naked you were free you were living in
3:37
my love adam and eve thought it was god condemning them and they condemned themselves and so what happens is they
3:43
cover themselves and they hide now the bible says that the kindness of god is
3:48
what leads us to repentance in the passion translation it says romans 2 4
Romans 214
3:53
do you realize that all the wealth of his extravagance extravagant kindness is meant to melt your heart
4:00
and lead you into repentance the loving kindness that's void completely of
4:05
condemnation that leads you to repentance the only power you have the
4:10
only ability you have to be able to repent to desire to repent is when you
4:16
can accurately see god's loving kindness towards you
4:21
and say no to the voice of condemnation adam and eve could have been like god i need you and run towards him seeing him
4:28
rightly like how it speaks of the father of the prodigal son arm is wide open the prodigal son did so many bad things and
4:35
he was gone for so long and he spent his father's inheritance his fortune and he runs back as a prodigal son and the
4:43
father is like this arms wide open throws a party for him because he's coming back that's the heart of the
4:48
father and the father of the prodigal son it's so powerful when you read that story because he wasn't even like having
4:54
his arms crossed and welcoming him back he wasn't even like we need to have a talk first before i even let you back on
5:00
my property the father just knew that none of that was gonna help the son to repent he knew that the son needed to
5:07
see that he loves him regardless of what he's done and that is the only chance the son had to
5:14
be able to and desire to change his ways and this is my testimony i was a christian my whole life and i was
5:20
lukewarm and i put one foot in the world and i was doing the partying thing i was in college i still loved god and i went
5:27
to church twice a week every week and i love to talk about god and i would set
5:32
out with the intention to read the bible and spend time with god it never happened and i didn't know what was
5:38
wrong with me but i did hear a voice in my head all the time condemning me for not reading the bible for not setting
5:45
alone time one-on-one for god and what i've learned looking back is
5:50
that voice of condemnation never once helped me to repent
5:56
it didn't change me so then i encountered the power of god for the first time six years ago
6:02
and as i encountered his power that's like when i really met jesus because the kingdom of god is not a matter of talk
6:08
but a power the real jesus is not just hearing about him and being told you need to go read your
6:13
bible and being told that he's good but actually meeting him encountering him
6:19
tangibly in power so he's touching your heart tangibly and opening up your
6:24
spiritual eyes so that's what happened to me just one time in in the presence of god i'm seeing people healed
6:30
delivered i received a prophetic word that was so loving of god the one thing that he chose to speak through that
6:36
prophet was full of so much love and letting me know that he was near with me near to me it opened my eyes to who he
6:43
is like this love that i've never known before i immediately knew that my god was not a god of condemnation it wasn't
6:50
even a sermon or anything that led me to have this revelation it was meeting jesus
6:55
and i just knew all those voices in my head were never caught i just knew it because his love there's no way he could
7:02
condemn the kindness of god led me to repentance seeing his love and kindness
7:09
it's like i wanted to spend time with him i wanted to go in his word before you know that condemnation voice when
7:15
you even go to read the bible you're feeling condemned like you're not really hearing from him
7:21
it's just words he's not really speaking it's just quiet you know voices in your head like that
7:26
you can be condemning yourself as you're reading the bible or you spend time with god and you're condemning yourself the
7:31
whole time that you're talking to god you're not praying well enough you're not spending enough time in prayer i
7:36
used to hear this voice all the time you're not sitting alone in silence enough that's why you're not hearing anything i used to hear all those
7:42
condemning voices so no wonder me and many many of you maybe
7:47
and many other people in this world have a hard time reading the bible spending time with god because the devil's just condemning them
7:54
every moment that they even try to spend time with god because they don't know that it's the devil's voice they don't know to reject
8:00
that devil's voice so my eyes open and i've never been the same devil can't fool me anymore i know the truth and the
8:06
truth set me free hallelujah romans 8 31 this is nlt version if god is for us
Romans 831
8:13
who can ever be against us since he did not spare even his own son but gave up
8:19
for gave him up for us all won't he also give us everything else who dares accuse us whom god has chosen
8:27
for his own no one for god himself has given us right standing with himself
8:34
right standing that means he sees us as children his beloved children like the
8:40
father of the prodigal son no matter what he was doing you're still my child you're the righteousness of god i see
8:46
you as pure you're made in my image
8:51
who then will condemn us no one for christ jesus died for us and has
8:58
raised to life for us and was raised to life for us and he is sitting in the place of honor at god's right hand catch this
9:06
he is pleading for us god is for you pleading for you on your side god is
9:12
your biggest cheer leader if you are an olympic athlete training to win the
9:18
olympics and you hire the best trainer he is for you
9:24
and sometimes you might mess up but guess what he's for you even more get up
9:29
come on you're gonna win that's okay get up try again you're gonna do this i'm
9:35
cheering you on and and i mean if you're a olympic trainer that literally
9:41
helps you to win because you're hearing that voice cheering you on saying i'm
9:47
for you that leads you to repentance in a way if you're that olympic athlete and you mess up or you don't feel like
9:53
practice that day and you sleep in and you say i'm not practicing day or something the coach isn't going to be like well you're never going to win now
9:59
peace no he's for you he wants to see you one more than
10:04
anything he's like it's okay come on let's go let's go it's okay i don't condemn you let's go he's what he wants
10:10
to pep you up he wants to cheer you on he just wants to see you win he's not looking at your
10:16
faults every time that you mess up he's cheering you on even the more
10:22
even more god is well aware that you are in a spiritual war god is well aware that the devil's out
10:28
to get you so you better believe he's cheering you on
10:34
you better believe he has compassion and grace and understanding for you we tend
10:39
to forget that we beat ourselves up and we think god's condemning us when devil's the one making those
10:45
condemning voices and god is just saying i love you i love you i want you to win
10:51
i want you to fulfill the purpose that i that i've made for you no matter how much you've messed up look at his heart
10:56
for saul who became paul saul was making the biggest mess anyone could ever make of his life killing
11:02
christians but god was still for him he will accomplish what i created him to do on this earth
11:08
i'm fighting for him i'm cheering him on jesus is pleading for him god is full of mercy and grace and compassion for you
11:16
24 7 when you mess up when you miss the mark when you don't do good enough
11:23
his mercy and grace and compassion that's when it is there and most of the time the reason that christians sin and
11:31
just are not spending time with god like they should is literally because
11:36
they don't have this revelation that i i mean that was me that was me before i just needed the
11:42
revelation so don't you understand that god has compassion he's like i want my people
11:48
just need to see they need to know my love he's not condemning he knows your the
11:53
eyes aren't open he knows you need to know his love more so he's fighting for you more not
12:00
condemning you not pushing you away he's fighting for you more
12:07
and this is why the devil tries so hard with this condemnation way because this is what makes christians
12:12
stuck this is what makes christians not know god's love and this is what makes christians not actually fulfill their calling and be
12:18
powerful i am able to be full of peace and joy and be able to
12:25
confidently do what god's calling me to do because i know the truth that the
12:30
devil is the one sending those condemnation voices and god's never condemning me if i never knew that i
12:36
would not be here today the bible talks about the story of
12:41
this pharisee who was fasting and who was paying his tithes and he says oh lord i'm so glad that i fast all these
12:48
times i'm so glad that i tithe that i'm not like this tax collector but
12:54
then the tax collector is is coming with this pure heart and just turning to god with a pure heart so
13:00
it says luke 18 verse 13. so the tax collector says oh god be merciful to me for i am a
Luke 1818
13:06
sinner i tell you this i tell you this sinner not the pharisee returned home justified before god for
13:13
those who exalt themselves to be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted in the body of christ
13:18
this whole scenario happens a lot like a lot of people in the body of christ
13:25
think that to be spiritual think that the way to get anointing to be used powerfully by god is to be like that
13:32
pharisee it's not the way and that's why we see a powerless church by and large
13:37
it's not the way this religious way of when you fast a
13:43
certain amount when you pray this certain amount when you read this amount of the bible then you're spiritual
13:49
then you're to be looked up to then you'll walk it anointing it's not true god's looking at the heart
13:55
god's looking at your obedience the cost to carry anointing isn't that you spend five hours per day reading the
14:02
bible fasting and praying that's not the cost to carry anointing anybody can do that and you can be
14:08
rejected like the pharisee god will only choose you when you have a pure heart that you just want to please him and obey him whatever that looks like
14:15
that's how god chooses you then there's a cost the cost isn't being religious and spending five hours a day praying
14:22
fasting and reading the bible religiously that's not the cost to carry the anointing the cost is to obey god however he's
14:30
asking you to the cost is
14:35
allowing god to mold your heart to become more like his which happens through going through
14:41
trials where people are mean to you mistreat you speak bad things about you
14:46
publicly behind your back betray you but you you were with god in those moments you were in relationship in him in those
14:53
moments you're looking to him and you're saying lord how should i respond lord what should i do what should i say
14:58
what should i not say how do i respond loving here i want to please you i want to obey you
15:04
in this god that's relationship with god but many people live their lives throughout without this revelation and
15:11
they think only their time at home reading the bible and praying and praying and many times is doing it
15:16
religiously they're thinking that's the only time that they're spending with god that's a relationship with god is and
15:22
god's like yes you are holy now
15:27
when really it's about walking every moment with the holy spirit
15:33
and living to please him every single moment and being in communication with
15:38
every single moment not religious communication but aware that he's with you
15:46
and like when someone speaks to you you think how should i respond it's like you're having communication with god in
15:51
your mind you know like it's the spirit giving you power giving you ability you live in this revelation that the spirit
15:57
is guiding you and leading you that's relationship that's intimacy
16:06
you're in the car you're in the plane you're traveling around and you include god with you in that moment maybe you
16:12
don't even speak aloud but you bring him in that moment with you you start to thank him maybe you're not even speaking
16:17
but you're thanking him from the inside in your heart that's communication that's intimacy
16:22
that's relationship with god and then we need to bring that when you actually do spend time in the word when you do spend
16:28
time alone time praying to god that it's not religious like that pharisee but that it's real it's a real relationship
16:36
and you're not thinking to yourself oh god's judging me how i'm talking to him right now do i sound spiritual
16:43
that you're talking like you normally talk that you're not judging yourself
16:48
um am i doing this right am i spending enough time here listening i don't know but it's
16:55
natural and you're just spending time with god because you love him we've turned it to be weird as christians like
17:00
we say god is so loving but to spend time with him is hard it should be
17:06
something natural your husband your wife your best friend you want to spend time with them it's not a cost to spend time
17:13
with them but we're thinking so religiously that this is the this is how you get the anointing this
17:18
is the cost to spend time religiously with god it's wrong it's religion
17:25
and it's living in that voice of condemnation because you're never gonna match up you're not seeing god rightly full of
17:31
love wanting to spend time with you and wanting you to enjoy spending time with him
17:37
you're seeing it as okay i'm doing this so i can become more spiritual i'm doing this so i can be righteous i'm doing
17:43
this so i can get anointing but god's a person
17:48
god's your best friend god's the one who loves you the most spending time with him should be the
17:54
most fun thing to do in the world but when you're seeing it wrongly you're not you're not seeing it as fun you're
17:59
seeing it as something you don't want to do and that's what pushes people away from spending time with god at all hallelujah
Romans 812
18:05
romans 8 verse 2 it says and because you belong to jesus it belongs to him the power of the
18:11
life-giving spirit has freed you from the power of sin that leads to death god
18:17
has not made it hard to live a pure and blameless life he's not made it hard
18:23
to not sin to not live a sinful life he's made it easy
18:29
and simple if you live in this revelation that because you belong to him it says
18:35
it says because you belong to him the power of the life-giving spirit has freed you from the power of sin that
18:41
leads to death romans 8 9 says you are not controlled by your sinful nature you are controlled
Romans 829
18:47
by the spirit if you have the spirit of god living in you romans 8 15 you have not received a
Romans 815
18:52
spirit that makes you fearful slaves instead you received god's spirit when he adopted you as his own children now we call him abba father for his spirit
18:59
joins with our spirit to affirm that we are god's children
19:04
and so wow if we can live in this revelation i am god's child god loves me
19:10
god's for me he's cheering me on his spirit lives in me to help me to live to
19:17
please him i'm no longer a slave to sin jesus removed that that sinful nature no
19:24
longer controls me if you live in that revelation you will be amazed at how all of that
19:31
sin falls off your life and how god transforms you mightily that
19:36
now you're actually not even desiring the things of the flesh you're only desiring the things of the
19:43
spirit when you live in this revelation when you live in this revelation now the holy spirit can actually help you you're
19:49
actually inviting the holy spirit in to help you to not sin to help you to live to please god
19:58
but you see how this revelation is void of that condemnation holy spirit god is for me holy spirit's
20:05
in me helping me to live to please him and to never sin
20:10
holy spirit is more powerful than my flesh and he's living in me holy spirit's more powerful than the
20:16
devil trying to attack me and lie to me and try to tempt me with sin holy
20:21
spirit's more powerful and he's cheering me on he's not standing there judging me how are you gonna do today are you gonna
20:27
sin today but you're living with that revelation god is for me he knows there's a
20:34
spiritual war out there but he's cheering me on and he's gonna help me deny my flesh he's gonna help me say no
20:41
to all of that sin and live to please him abba father
20:49
that's the truth but how many of us don't live in that revelation and live thinking that god is watching
20:55
us are you gonna sin today are you gonna mess up today that's not god
21:00
when we live that way we're not inviting the holy spirit and to help us
21:06
you knowing this truth sets us free so now we can actually invite god in and live in this revelation i'm telling you
21:11
i've been amazed to see the transformation in my life from when i first received my calling when i was first baptized in the holy spirit and
21:17
that same year i received my calling i've been amazed to see just this ease of which i could live in
21:23
the spirit just this easy i wasn't having like come on deny my flesh
21:30
it wasn't like hard like that it was before i had this revelation before i had the baptism holy spirit before i
21:37
started to walk in the anointing the anointing is that oil that makes things come with ease
21:42
it was hard before but now that i'm where the anointing is i have the baptism holy spirit the fire to empower
21:48
me it's it's been easy
21:53
i do not desire the things of the world at all but it's not because i'm holier than thou it's not because oh yes i'm so good
22:00
i've denied my flesh it's because i walked in this revelation with the holy spirit helping me and
22:05
transforming me into his image so here number one we're going to go over areas of the condemnation where the
22:11
condemnation voice comes in there is no condemnation for you when you mess up
22:17
listen we are being transformed into the image of god it says in the bible we are being transformed
22:24
none of us are jesus yet right but i mean it's possible for us to look
22:30
a whole lot like him but we're not there yet we're all on different journeys
22:36
i was i did not look how i did six years ago i hope you wouldn't judge me though
22:41
six years ago right you know i'm just in a different journey i shouldn't judge myself six years ago
22:47
i'm in a different journey than maybe one of you was at six years ago for example we're all on different journeys
22:52
we're all being transformed by the spirit we sometimes we make mistakes the bible
22:57
says that god corrects those who he loves the bible doesn't say you mess up you're
23:02
done it says he corrects that means we'll mess up it'll happen as we're being transformed into his
23:08
image that's part of it we mess up god shows us this isn't the way i want you to go this
23:15
way instead i want you to notice this is not good what you did i have a better
23:21
way for you that leads to life now go this way that's the voice of
23:26
conviction remember that condemnation never leads
23:32
to repentance but conviction is when you're seeing god rightly the kindness of god leading you
23:37
to repentance so when you mess up you should see god rightly in that way saying this way is better my son my
23:44
daughter i'm correcting you right now this way is my way that way leads to death i want you to do this to please me
23:52
more that doesn't please me there but this pleases me but god's not saying it with
23:57
condemnation he's saying as a cheerleader wanting you to win cheering you on he's for you remember it says
24:02
that god is for us who can be against us god's for you you messed up that's okay we're gonna go this way i'm showing you
24:09
this way and so in that moment when we hear that conviction we also have to say no to the
24:15
condemnation voice because the devil will be on it when he sees you mess up i'm telling you as believers the devil's on it boom
24:22
condemnation voice he's on it so you have to be aware you need to reject those lies of the devil
24:29
you need to understand what's going on that's not god and god does not want you to condemn yourself because then you're agreeing with the devil you're being
24:36
like adam and eve and you're turning away from god that's not going to lead to repentance so if you really want to please god if
24:42
you really feel sorry about what you did reject those lies and see god rightly
24:47
and see him with his arms wide open and run to his arms so you can have the power to repent it's important to feel
24:53
sorry but not feel condemned that's how we repent correctly
24:59
i reject the voices of condemnation i remind myself this is how god is for me right now arms wide open not judging me
25:05
and then you just honestly be before god see him rightly with those eyes of full of love and compassion
25:11
those eyes of loving correction you know are and you say i'm sorry god
25:17
i really it makes me sad that i grieved your heart in any way if i grieved your heart in any way i just want to please
25:22
you lord help me to not do that again i only want to please you
25:28
be sorry but don't condemn yourself be sorry and run into his arms and
25:34
that's it and then we move on don't stay there don't stay there wallowing that you messed up but let it empower you
25:41
sometimes it's a good thing i've messed up before and i see it as it was a good thing because it made me more
25:46
intentional like oh this area i don't want to do that again so i'm going to make more intention
25:52
be serious about this so that i don't make that mistake again that's a good thing i can see the good how god turned
25:58
that into good amen so there's no condemnation when you mess up
26:03
if you ever mess up remind yourself there's no condemnation for me right now god doesn't even want me to have a bad
26:10
day god doesn't want me to feel sad god wants me to be full of peace and joy it's done god's helping me
26:17
he's cheering me on we're going forward not backward hallelujah number two there's no
No Condemnation
26:22
condemnation in your relationship with god never see
26:27
yourself as being judged by god with how you pray with how you read the bible
26:32
god wants him to be your closest friend so you need to look at him in that way that he is your very best friend he's
26:39
with you always and just like your very best friend is never judging you and your relationship together
26:45
god is never judging you and your relationship together and this is how we can be powerful vessels of god
26:52
we're powerful vessels of god because we know god's love and we live in god's
26:58
love and we want the world to know this amazing love because our eyes were once
27:03
blind we once condemned ourselves but now we know we know this amazing
27:09
love of god and so this is what fuels us this is what gives us strength and
27:15
passion to minister to people this is how we can see people with god's eyes god wants to heal you god wants to
27:22
deliver you this is how we can stand strong against all persecution because we know god's love we're living in god's
27:30
love and we want people to know god's love
27:35
that's all that it is so you can't be a powerful vessel of god if you're living in condemnation you don't actually know
27:41
god's love and you're not living in god's love so that a way to be an anointed vessel
27:46
of god is not to condemn yourself and say i need to pray and read the bible more i'm not being a good enough
27:52
christian i feel so desperate in this for you to know this because i used to be that way
27:58
and when i when i received the calling to be an apostle i was like what on earth
28:03
i'm not a real spiritual person i i believed those condemnation voices
28:09
so much those condemnation voices about my relationship with god that i thought god would never choose me for a big calling
28:15
like that so now i knew i was living in lies when i received that prophetic word it opened
28:21
my eyes i was living in lies a condemnation and so i'm here to tell you god wants to
28:26
use you mightily want to be an inspiration for you
28:32
i don't because i never heard this before the other preachings i heard there's
28:37
condemnation that comes through it many times because they don't have that revelation that i'm sharing with you today
28:43
so it's like you need to read the bible more you need to pray more you need to live right you need to stop sinning like
28:48
that was the the messages that i was hearing and so therefore i disqualified myself
28:54
completely to being used powerfully by god i did
28:59
so i'm telling you today if god can call me god can call you i don't want you to ever see me as some
29:07
unattainable super spiritual person god could use you too but you have to say no to those condemnation voices and live in
29:13
god's love receive his love for you amen i want to go into this
Be Aware
29:19
there is no condemnation in your mind the devil's speaking in your mind a lot
29:24
you need to be aware the bible says to be aware that because the devil's roaring around like a lion prowling
29:30
around like a lion seeking whom he can power he's in your mind seeking to devour you you have to be aware you have
29:38
to be on guard listen to this many thoughts that you have are not your
29:44
own original thoughts they come from the devil this is how many people have identity issues
29:51
because the devil comes with a strategic attack speaking you are this you are this you are this you are this you are
29:57
this this is what you like this is what you like this is what you like it's the devil planning those lies so many times trying
30:04
to make you think that just because you're hearing again and again in your mind that it is you this guy shared this
30:09
testimony joseph and this testimony he's sharing that he
30:14
heard a message of me it's just like a one message that one minute message that i spoke which is what i'm about to share with you right now
30:20
but listen to this testimony he says i watched this video this one minute video last year about 2021 december
30:29
ever since i watched this video i am set free from demons planting lies lustful
30:35
thoughts in my mind i thought i had a desire to speak bad words to someone and i thought i have a
30:41
desire to lust but i don't want to the demon was planning homosexual
30:46
thoughts in my mind since i was a child the demon since i was a child was like you are gay that's your identity
30:54
so i follow what came through my mind for long years believing that's who i am
30:59
but ever since i saw this video the truth set me free
31:04
hallelujah now i know already my real identity and while i'm continuing watching your
31:10
videos i started to know god's real voice he says you are my son
31:16
all the voice words that you hear inside your mind against yourself against others is not your voice
31:21
you have a beautiful heart like mine i cried a lot when i heard this prompting of the holy spirit
31:28
jesus is really talking to me a lot through you i'm even crying right now while typing praise god
31:35
hallelujah hallelujah so that's a sermon right there
31:41
that's a sermon right there he revealed what i was just sharing with you how the devil comes and the devil can come and
31:48
speak to you and say i don't like that person the devil can come and speak to you and
The Devil
31:54
say you should say this out loud about that person the devil can come to you and say you'll
32:01
never make it the devil can come to you and say you're not good enough you don't speak well enough
32:07
the devil can come to you and say you're not a good enough christian the devil can come
32:12
you to say limitless lies so many lies
32:18
but so many of you think it's your own original thoughts because we live in the world and that's what the world says
32:24
that whatever you're thinking whatever you're feeling that's you but the devil is the father of lies
32:32
and he comes in your mind making you think it is your original thought that
32:37
guy in that testimony shared how he was having these lustful thoughts he was having these thoughts of speaking bad
32:43
about people but he didn't want to do those things the devil will do that like you could have no desire to sleep with
32:49
someone to to hit on someone you know to do but the moment you see someone you
32:55
could hear lies that you should do that but you your heart is i want to please god and i don't i know that's not god's
33:01
will i don't want that so you have to be very aware that those thoughts coming through are not you
33:08
when you truly with your heart desire i want to please god this is what i want i want to be in his will that's the real
33:15
you that's the real you and so those other thoughts that come in
33:22
and those other feelings that come in you can have jealous feelings but you already vowed to god lord i want
33:29
to love everybody i want to support everybody like you i don't want to be jealous that's
33:34
you but the devil will come and speak those things he'll give you those feelings
33:40
you need to understand that's not you if you think it's you oh boy you will be so condemning yourself that's what comes
33:47
next that's why the devil puts those thoughts in there that's why because he doesn't want you to know god's love and
33:53
know that you have control over yourself he wants to control you
33:59
and fill you with condemnation and make you think that god's so disappointed of you and you're not a good christian when your heart that's
34:05
why it's god's all about the heart god's all about the heart
34:11
hallelujah so you have to be aware like every feeling you get every thought that you
34:17
get that doesn't align with god's will you need to understand that's not you
34:25
you are that's why god says you are the righteousness of god you are pure
34:30
that's who you are that's your identity you are a child of god you are made in
34:35
my image and the devil is trying to form you into something that you are not do
34:40
not believe his lies and how do you do this the bible says ii corinthians 10 5 we demolish arguments
34:48
we demolish arguments of the devil coming as feelings and thoughts we demolish them
34:54
and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of god
35:00
did you hear that we demolish arguments of the devil and every
35:06
pretension from the devil that sets itself up against the knowledge of god who god says i am
35:12
god's will for my life we demolish them and we take captive
35:18
every thought to make it obedient to christ this scripture reveals to us that many
35:26
of your thoughts are from the devil it says we take every we take captive
35:31
every thought so this is how you
35:37
get rid of those stupid voices in your head those voices going against who you
35:42
are in christ and those voices of condemnation you demolish them you take them captive
35:49
so we have to see the devils lies in our mind like they are criminals
35:54
and we need to be policemen and women we need to take it so seriously this is serious business
36:01
and we need to take them and make them prisoners that's how we do it when you do that can speak it aloud i reject that
36:07
thought i do not have those desires to go after that person i am a child of god
36:13
i am pure i do not have dirty thoughts i have pure thoughts i have the mind of
36:18
christ i love that person i do not want bad for that person i love that person i
36:24
take captive that thought right now that says i want that person to not succeed
36:29
that i'm jealous of that person these desires i have to sin specific
36:35
desires they are not my desires these thoughts i take those thoughts captive
36:40
i have the desire only to please god to live holy to live in his will speak it aloud
36:46
take captive the thoughts from the devil and speak aloud god's truth that's how you win the spiritual war
36:55
and eventually those lies are going to get out of you like completely i don't live with voices of condemnation
37:00
i'll see the devil strategically come once in a while but he never wins
37:06
but i've seen such amazing transformation where you know it says resist the devil and i'll flee from you
37:11
so i've seen that when i've done this spiritual work i've seen the results of it i've seen
37:16
hallelujah i live so free in my mind where i don't have to deal with these constant lies in my head anymore
37:23
because the devil had to flee i wasn't letting him stay i resisted him and i took them all captive and made him
37:29
prisoners to christ amen so there is no condemnation when you
Dreams
37:36
mess up when you make a mistake there is no condemnation in your relationship with god your life as a believer
37:43
there is no condemnation in your mind the thoughts and feelings you're having there's no condemnation
37:50
and number four there is no condemnation from the dreams you've had the world
37:56
will say that all your dreams come from your imagination but the devil likes to send dreams too god sends dreams some
38:02
dreams might be your imagination and some dreams are sent from the devil
38:08
there are some people that have literal bondage in their dreams where they need freedom they need the anointing to
38:13
destroy the yoke and send a spiritual spouse out that's sleeping with them for example again and again and again
38:19
there's some people that have recurring nightmares horrifying nightmares they need deliverance
38:25
and then there's all of us believers who will face these attacks from the devil
38:30
where once in a while the devil will come in your dreams and the biggest scheme i've seen of the
38:36
devil it'll be different for other all people some the devil might uh try to bring fear in your dreams for me i've
38:42
seen the strategy of condemnation in my dreams where and and this never happened until
38:48
i started walking in my anointing and so this is why i know this scheme of condemnation
38:54
god wants us to be free from condemnation we have to be free from condemnation because if we are not free from condemnation we cannot love fully
39:02
we are not living in the revelation of god's love so we cannot love people well
39:07
but when we are knowing god loves me that's when we can love people the best
39:13
and so i saw that i never had these types of dreams these condemnation dreams until i stepped into the anointing
39:19
and ever since then it's it's been once in a while the devil will come with
39:25
this dream with this scheme and he'll come in my dreams and he will send me dreams of me doing bad things in
39:30
my dream that i have no desire doing it all he can send sexual dreams i have no desire doing that at all and in the
39:37
dream i will feel trapped i will feel like my flesh is controlling me and that is never me in real life
39:43
and in my dream i will feel condemnation the dream can feel real and i will feel
39:49
i will be condemning myself and you wake up feeling condemning wake up condemning yourself the devil's
39:55
scheme is to make me think that that dream is my dream was really me and my dream that's the devil's scheme that's a
40:02
sneaky way of trying to bring condemnation trying to make me think to condemn myself that it was really me and
40:07
then walk in that condemnation your dreams are not you you need to understand the scheme of the devil that
40:13
he will have you doing bad things sinful things in your dreams for the specific purpose of hoping
40:19
you'll condemn yourself not even to try to get you to desire to do that or something it's literally to get you to
40:24
condemn yourself because you think it's really you so you need to wake up and reject that dream you need
40:31
to wake up every time this is what i do i wake up i'm groggy i say i reject that dream and that's it and i don't allow it
40:37
to come back in my mind i know that i resist the devil and he'll flee from me so i say i reject the dream and i have
40:43
peace i know oh the devil's mad he's trying again he lost because i rejected that dream
40:50
and now i'm living about my life with jesus with that in the past don't allow that dream to come in your memory
40:56
throughout the day you rejected it it's gone and now move on with jesus the devil's defeated immediately
41:03
hallelujah i feel the freedom this is what god wants us to be just bursting with his peace and joy and his love
41:11
we can't have the heaviness of condemnation anymore we can't have the heaviness of shame and
41:17
guilt we can't carry that it's time it ends now and this is rare y'all this is rare and
41:23
the body of christ a lot of people are bound with this condemnation
41:28
and god's counting on us all to speak the truth
41:35
and to be overflowing with love like no one's ever seen because they're still bound with condemnation
41:41
so that they can be free too as god moves through you powerfully with the love that's flowing through you when you
41:48
have the this revelation you will love people so well because you know god doesn't condem
41:53
so you don't even have like judgmental thoughts about anybody you don't you're seen with the mind of
41:58
god now god doesn't condem there's no condemnation and so even when someone wrongs you you
42:03
don't condem you don't judge there's no kind of nation in christ jesus
42:09
we're not called to condemn anybody so now it's just flowing out of us because we're living in the truth of
42:15
christ amen hallelujah hallelujah praise god
