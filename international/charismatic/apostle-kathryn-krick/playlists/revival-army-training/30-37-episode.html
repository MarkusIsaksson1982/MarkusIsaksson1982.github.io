we have been doing a series on the book that I recently released the secret of
0:05
the anointing here hallelujah yes and we're nearing
0:14
nearing almost the end of the series uh if you have not heard the many messages
0:19
that we've had for this series you go you can go on my YouTube page and there
0:25
is a uh playlist just for these the secret of the anointing play list so
0:30
make sure you catch up on all of those messages and um I'm going to be teaching
0:35
soon about once how once you have the anointing how to effectively release it
0:41
how to effectively use it really how to effectively Minister how to effectively
0:47
pray for people but before I teach
0:55
that it's important for you to understand that it's
1:00
these are this this it is it is it is important you are in the spirit when you are ministering and walking in the
1:07
anointing and praying for people it's not about like this checklist it's not about like a school
1:15
training but you need to be in the spirit walk in the
1:20
spirit and that also means you have to understand the principles in the
1:27
spiritual realm like we are in a kingdom of
1:32
God and when people come to receive healing and
1:38
freedom it is not really like we're a hospital that's just like okay here is
1:44
your medicine here you go bye like okay this is the issue this is what we do
1:50
you're on your way no the healing and freedom that
1:55
Jesus releases comes when when you are open to
2:03
Jesus you you want to receive Jesus not not just I want to receive healing and
2:08
freedom but you want to receive Jesus and part of receiving Jesus are these
2:16
gifts these benefits these blessings these Supernatural blessings of healing
2:21
of freedom and Abundant Life these things come when you receive
2:28
Jesus and and God is so good and he doesn't like force you to be a serious
2:36
disciple for one year until he can release any healing or freedom to you
2:41
he'll sometimes release this healing and freedom even your even day one of you being open to receiving Jesus maybe even
2:48
before you're surrendered completely but the principle of receiving healing and
2:54
freedom has to do with receiving Jesus and these are the things that come as you receive Jesus so you see how it's
3:02
different from just going to the hospital and getting the fix and getting the uh medicine you see how it's
3:09
different right and so also also it's important to understand
3:16
that when you receive Jesus it's it's so important that you
3:22
are doing as he commands and you are
3:28
following his principles of his kingdom like receiving Jesus
3:33
doesn't just simply mean saying the sinner's prayer and attending church and
3:39
praying and reading the Bible regularly like that's not what it means
3:44
to be a Christian alone there's more to it it's following his instructions and
3:51
his commands and really living in obedient life to him obedient to
3:57
him and so what that looks like in his kingdom are some like core major
4:07
foundational principles that are a part of our daily
4:13
life that we do and if we are going to say I am a child of God it must mean that we are
4:21
doing these principles that he has commanded not just picking our favorite
4:28
ones and so so principles what I'm what I'm talking about when I'm saying like principles foundational principles I'm
4:35
just going to share a few of them so you know what I'm so you can understand what I'm talking about here are some core
4:41
principles of what it means to be a child of God being planted in a church in a real
4:49
Church where God's power is moving so that you can be equipped and protect have a covering be protected in the
4:56
spiritual realm so you can receive the anointing flowing in your life that's one of the major principles you cannot
5:03
just be without church or just go once in a while to church and truly call yourself a child
5:10
of God this is one of the major parts meanings of being a child of God one of
5:15
the major principles this is it's really important to God Amen because otherwise you won't
5:22
be equipped you'll be beat up by the devil and you'll be living this individualistic Christian Life that
5:28
doesn't exist we are called to be in a body and work together be in an be in an army be on a team
5:37
amen and I've taught a lot about this principle so I know a lot of you understand this is this being one of the
5:43
main core principles another core principle is opening your mouth and sharing the
5:51
good news living your life testifying and speaking about God not withholding
5:57
what he's done for your life every opportunity you get using your social media to spread the good
6:05
news another core principle is living
6:10
the word reading the word regularly inviting
6:16
the holy spirit in not just reading it like a textbook but hearing from God as you read eating the word meditating on
6:24
the word and then living the word living what you were reading and meditating on
6:30
that it becomes you that's another core
6:35
principle another core principle is serving in the work of God to not just
6:42
be a receiver but contribute to the work of God helping the work of God to
6:48
advance with your own hands in different ways in different seasons it will look differently with
6:55
the amount and what exactly you're serving in the work of God but to start with you can be sharing uh videos posts
7:03
of the ministry that you're planted in like fivefold church for example that's one of the big ways that you are serving
7:08
and making the the kingdom of God to advance using your hands W
7:15
service amen and so another one of these
7:21
core major principles in the kingdom of God what it means to be a child of God is sewing
7:32
sewing sewing into the kingdom of God this isn't an optional this isn't a
7:40
ritual or tradition this is a core principle of being a child of God in the
7:47
kingdom of God Amen so um this principles is just very
7:55
important for you to understand before I I teach you how to
8:01
minister effectively how to release the anointing effectively how to pray for people effectively um
8:08
because sometimes as I shared it's not like you're a doctor in the hospital
8:13
they come see you the person the sick person comes to you you diagnose them you you give them the prescription the
8:18
medicine and that's it sometimes it's things that the person themselves has to do that will unlock
8:26
the freedom sometimes a person needs to more surrendered sometimes the person needs to get in the
8:34
word they're not taking God and the things of God seriously enough and it's
8:40
keeping doors open sometimes they need to be shutting doors and that will unlock the freedom
8:47
it's not as simple as demon go sometimes there are different keys
8:53
and it and it's it has to do with the person doing something that unlocks those keys of
9:02
Deliverance Hallelujah sometimes sewing can play a part in this because all of these
9:07
principles that I shared just shared with you these must be a part of every
9:13
believer's life regularly not just one of them two of them three of them they must be a
9:19
regular part of your life that you're regularly doing if not you're not truly surrendered and you have a door
9:26
open so that's that's why I said you have to understand this principle because sometimes this plays a part into
9:34
unlocking freedom in a person's life when they actually do this
9:40
principle apply this principle of sewing
9:52
amen so Galatians 6 verse
9:58
7 it says' do not be deceived God is Not
10:03
mocked for whatever a man SWS that he will also
10:12
reap so when we're talking about sewing like there are so many different
10:19
scriptures in the Bible talking about sewing there's a lot this is one of the reasons why we
10:26
know this is a very important principle that we do amen um and whenever we see sewing in
10:34
the word of God it can have multiple meanings sewing can there there's a
10:42
scripture um there's a scripture that talks about when you reap In the Flesh
10:48
you sorry when you sew in the flesh you will reap In the Flesh when you sew in the spirit you will reap in the spirit
10:55
and so a big meaning of that is when you are doing things of the the flesh actions and words in the
11:02
flesh you're going to keep reaping more of of demonic
11:08
oppression more of the things of the enemy in your life more
11:15
bondage um but when you sew into the spirit which is doing the things of God
11:21
doing what God is instructing you to do putting your eyes to him you're what you're going to Reap is more of him more
11:26
of his Spirit more of his blessings more more of his freedom healing Abundant Life
11:33
amen uh and so I mean this can be in so many different aspects of life um when
11:39
you are sewing into how you're spending your time and watching like horror
11:45
movies listening listening to carnal worldly music and you're talking with your
11:51
friends about worldly things negative things you're now going to be
11:57
reaping more more dark thoughts in your mind and more darkness in general you're
12:06
going to get even more dark people coming in your life and they're going to be doing a bunch of dark things to you
12:13
um I mean because they have opened doors to the enemy so much right so when you
12:20
speak curse when you curse over other people when you speak words of death over other people or over your own life
12:28
this will come back in your life you will find other people speaking words of death over you and if you speak words of
12:35
death over yourself you will find that that you you are now getting oppression
12:42
getting more attacked from the enemy BEC that it's a reaping from what you have
12:48
sowed vice versa when you speak good things to people when you are kind to
12:53
people when you speak life to people people will speak life back to you you
12:59
sometimes it's that exact person that you're interacting with but not just that in the spiritual realm literally
13:08
people will favor will be upon you people will treat you nicely people will speak good things to
13:16
you um and some people might be saying that sounds like Karma yeah karma is
13:22
stealing the principle of God and bringing it into the devil's Kingdom
13:31
yeah I mean new age the new age uh like religion spirituality whatever you want
13:37
to call it is demonic so um New Age basically they're
13:43
open to spirituality in general but they don't believe in that Jesus is Lord but they
13:51
simply are just open to spirituality and what happens is when you just open yourself up like that but
13:58
you're you're not accepting Jesus it's the action of accepting the devil even
14:03
though you don't mean to be but that's what happens and so now the devil begins to
14:10
teach one the principles of the spiritual realm because the princip the
14:16
spiritual realm has the Demonic Kingdom and God's kingdom the Devil is a fallen
14:23
angel so the devil didn't create a whole new principle spiritual realm area it's
14:29
the same spiritual realm and so the same principles in the kingdom of God are the same principles
14:36
in the kingdom of darkness I mean that it's just one spiritual
14:42
world and and and and the demons know these laws and they operate in these
14:47
laws to try to have success because if they don't they don't get to access Supernatural
14:53
power from the devil but but when you apply God's principles and laws you
14:59
access God's Supernatural power when you apply the same principles and laws
15:04
without Jesus you are accessing Supernatural power but it's not from Jesus it's from the devil because
15:10
there's no in between there's no neutral Supernatural power um and so people see that things
15:17
work but that's the devil tricking you the blessings of God come without sorrow
15:22
which means the blessings from the devil do come with sorrow
15:27
so yeah yes so it will seem like things are
15:32
working but it never lasts for these new aged people or for these witchcraft people psychic people it will see seem
15:40
like things are working um things are going according to the principles and the spiritual laws but there's no
15:46
protection from God over over that and there's only curses and death
15:52
and destruction and stealing and killing that comes from the devil that's what the devil wants from for all of his
15:59
people uh receiving his powers deep down that's what he wants he'll trick them
16:04
and say work for me and I'll bless you but the blessings come with sorrow
16:11
always so karma is a is is stolen from God's kingdom but it's a true spiritual
16:19
principle it's the this principle here that whatever you seow you will reap and so as I said as I said again it
16:27
I mean when you are swing good things kindness love that will really come back
16:32
to you it's a spiritual principle and law not just like immediately that
16:38
person because they were blessed because you blessed them no no it's way beyond that it's a powerful
16:46
[Applause] principle like you'll be generous towards people and you'll and kind to
16:53
people and then you'll find randomly later on people being generous to you and kind to you you don't even know them
16:59
it's because of what you swed it's not a coincidence it's not just because God loves you it's because you're following
17:05
God's principles so he's able to release to you what he wants to give to
17:11
you
17:21
amen oh I also want to mention if you are a Christian and you are reaping I'm
17:26
you were sewing bad things like you messed up and went to a psychic you
17:33
messed up and you started sinning in some area you messed up and started speaking words of death this is a
17:39
principle what you sow you will reap so even a Christian can reap these things and that's why we see many people in
17:46
demonic oppression many times because this spiritual principle it's a law that
17:51
ju it just happens but the difference is that when you give your life to
17:56
Jesus and rep repent he can take away
18:02
that bad reaping you like because you I mean you
18:08
could just like imagine Saul that turned into Paul imagine all that he sowed
18:14
that's a long lifetime of bad reaping what he was supposed to get was
18:20
hell on Earth according to what he did killing so many people Christians
18:26
nonetheless that would be a lifetime and then eternity of Hell on Earth and hell
18:31
that's what he was supposed to reap but because he gave his life to Jesus and repented Jesus took away
18:38
that reaping that bad reaping but this
18:44
is what many people don't understand they think that it just naturally goes away when you give your life to
18:52
Jesus no there can be some cases where that happens but many times it comes
18:58
from really surrendering devoting your life to God which means following his
19:06
principles following his principles like planting yourself in a church where
19:12
God's power is moving being a true disciple there being in the word living
19:18
living your life in the word taking the word seriously applying it in your life um and serving him serving him in his
19:26
work and so when you apply all these principles it
19:33
makes this demonic reaping this bad reaping to be
19:40
lifted but many people they they think that it's just you give your life to Jesus and all of that goes away no you
19:47
have to follow God's principles all it is is surrender but many people don't understand what
19:53
principles mean these principles the importance of them many people think surrender just says I'm a Christian I
19:59
read my Bible and pray and I try my best to live well but yet they're not planted
20:04
but yet they're not sewing but yet they're not serving but yet they're not really living their life for Jesus being
20:11
unashamed of him and sharing testimonies of him every day they're not and they just think everything will
20:18
just go away when you apply these principles then this bad reaping goes away and all it is is
20:27
surrender amen hallelujah so there are different kinds
20:34
of sewing as I shared the last part of sewing oh another part of sewing can be giving to
20:42
the poor being generous to others who are in need that's an area of sewing too
20:48
and then there is another category of sewing which is all supper on its own
20:53
which is sewing into the kingdom of God sewing into the
21:00
church the house of God that's it's you know you when you
21:06
when you see the scriptures about sewing you can't just choose which way you want to
21:12
sew when go when you're seeing God commanding you to se you can't choose which ways you need to be doing all of
21:18
the ways but you and you espec you especially better make sure you're not neglecting sewing into God's
21:25
kingdom a lot of people think oh well I give to the poor so that's my sewing into the kingdom of God
21:32
no God's biggest Works main works the the
21:39
core place of his work his kingdom coming Deliverance healing the word
21:45
being preached taking place is his house his church his
21:52
churches that's where the equipping happens that's where the equipping
21:58
happens so that the hundreds or the thousands that are at the one church are
22:04
equipped to walk in God's power equipped to be a mature disciple Victorious over the devil and able to be effective an
22:12
effective disciple of Jesus that's making disciples that's Healing The Sick casting out demons and bringing them into the
22:17
kingdom they will not be equipped without the church because that's simply God's way doesn't matter what the
22:24
Christian culture of today thinks it's what the word of God says says Ephesians 41 that he gave the five full ministry
22:31
Apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers for the equipping of the Saints so that they would no longer be
22:37
immature but mature vessels of God and equipped to do works of service
22:43
amen hallelujah and so um we see with the Apostle Peter we see that the sick and
22:49
Demon oppressed were coming under his shadow and all were being healed we're seeing with Apostle Paul it says that
22:55
people would bring handkerchiefs and aprons to his body he was so full of anointing that they would take the handkerchiefs and aprons to the sick and
23:00
Demon oppressed and they would be healed and freed and it talks about in the book of Acts how they were gathering together
23:06
regularly in the church the church of those times and it says that the Believers were in awe and wonder at the
23:14
signs and wonders and miracles performed by the apostles and many were being added to them to the church to their
23:20
number every week every day so you see all of this it's you see
23:26
this importantance of the church Peter and Paul they were Apostles leaders in the church and so
23:33
when we're seeing these big Works take place these big Miracles and the equipping is happening in the
23:42
church so Hallelujah so we're all called to go out in the whole world outside the
23:48
fir walls outside the church and do the work of God but the core like where it
23:54
starts from is the house of God the church so that's why it's it's that's
24:02
why you can't um neglect giving to the house of God you can't only give to the
24:08
poor and count that as giving to God you have to be giving it to the house of God
24:14
as well this is God's principle amen so um whenever we see these sewing
24:22
scriptures it's important that you realize it's definitely talking about sewing into God's house
24:28
and it applies to the other kinds of sewing as
24:36
well today I'm going to teach you what happens when you
24:43
sew be Hallelujah because God doesn't just say so cuz I want you to
24:51
S God's doesn't have these principles just to have these
24:56
principles there's powerful things that take place when we follow his
25:01
principles there it's not just God being oh let me just give you things that you need to do and it's so important we have
25:09
this understanding of the significance and the power Behind These
25:15
principles or else it will become religious ritual tradition we won't
25:20
value it we might forget to do it and we won't do it to the extent that God wants us to do
25:26
it we go halfway when we don't have the revelation of the significance of it the
25:33
importance of it what's happening when I do this what's happening when I come to church and be planted what happens in
25:39
the spiritual realm what happens when I eat the word of God when I meditate on it all day what
25:46
happens what happens when I serve in the house of God what in the work of God what happens
25:53
there's things that happen powerful amazing things that happen Rel releasing Abundant Life to you and what happens
26:01
when I seow you see so much of the
26:06
church doesn't have revelation of these principles okay well this isn't really a
26:13
Q&A but I'll answer your question hun but just so everyone knows she asked a good question about sewing can you sew
26:19
in more than one place yes you can but it's important I haven't gotten to the teaching yet about like um like sewing
26:26
into the house of God yet how to do this but it's important to be planted and one of the principles of being planted being
26:32
planted means staying in one place Not Here There and Everywhere and there's tons of amazing Ministries there are a
26:40
hand there are some I won't say millions of anointed Ministries but there are
26:46
some there are more than one and many of them are good are great are from God but
26:53
even though even so God still calls us to be in one place and so it's important
26:59
you have this Revelation because otherwise if you don't have this Revelation you'll be like well this is good well this is good well this is good
27:06
I love here I love here I love here and So you you're putting your attention all these different places and you're also
27:12
putting your seed in all these different places and it's neglecting the principle truly of being
27:19
planted and so it it can seem like a good thing but you're missing it's important this is just God's principle
27:25
that we are planted like a there's a scripture in the in Psalms it says be like a tree that is planted by a river
27:33
you will be like a tree and you will bear good fruit in every season and your you your um you your leaves will never
27:40
wither but you always produce good fruit it's speaking of being in one place so
27:46
it can look good this good over here it's good over here it's good over here but you're uprooting yourself and your leaves won't
27:56
prosper and and a big reason why this is important is because God has different
28:01
visions and assignments for all of his all of his people like those of you that
28:06
are planted here God has given you the same vision assignment as he's given me he's called you to be part of this
28:12
vision and assignment which is to declare that
28:17
Jesus is Alive that he is moving in power that Revival is now which is to to to embrace his Spirit
28:26
his anointing and release it not be ashamed of him but to do what he says and preach the gospel
28:33
heal the sick and cast out
28:39
demons and and to truly desire church and Revival God's way not our way to not
28:47
be stuck with Christian culture tradition but but be obedient to God's
28:53
way God's way of having Church which is the five-fold ministry of according to his word in Ephesians
29:00
411 so that means we must Embrace and accept and receive the ministry of the
29:06
Apostles and the prophets and so this is all I'm sharing a lot of the vision and assignment
29:14
here we are spreading God's Revival releasing his power preaching the Good
29:20
News making disciples mature disciples here but there's different visions and
29:26
assignments other places that aren't the same as this but are still good but
29:32
God's called you to one and in college you go for one degree not a million and
29:38
you specialize there that's one of the reasons he needs you to be serious about being planted not having any teaching Here There and Everywhere you're going
29:45
to stay at a baby level While others here will be Advanced and also are trustworthy for God to put the anointing
29:52
in because they're following the principles and now they're doing powerful things walking in the anointing in fulfilling their purpose but you're
29:59
staying like a child that's one of the reasons another
30:05
one of the big reasons is that God needs an army not a bunch of baby
30:12
Christians like like even the work of God here there's so much that goes into
30:17
the work of God we have for example different podcasts now and videos out
30:23
and I've received help lately from some of some from some many people here on the serving team and even people
30:29
watching online that they're editing more so more people are able to receive
30:34
more messages more food we have many people translating on
30:41
Sundays and Wednesdays now the the Spanish uh the Spanish translation and
30:46
now so many thousands in Spanish speaking countries and uh just people
30:51
who speak Spanish are now receiving we have we have several Now
30:59
official um social media accounts that people now are running and serving in different countries we have one in
31:05
France one in Indonesia one in Italy uh with Spanish one uh German one and this
31:15
is people like spending hours a day just choosing on their own to do this out of
31:20
their own heart you know and so many more people are they're they're testifying they're receiving Miracles they're translating to me saying I
31:26
received Miracle through this watching this video but this is just a little example they couldn't be doing this all
31:33
of these people are planted you know you have to take it
31:38
seriously this one place where you are at where God has called you to be then he will entrust you with more and your
31:44
heart will also be there so that you are giving more time there you're a you know
31:49
you're able to sacrifice because your heart is there so much but if you're Here There and Everywhere it won't
31:56
happen it won't F you won't follow through you can say yeah I want to serve and then it fades out things come up in
32:03
life and you don't end up serving so if God can get people to be serious then we
32:09
can be at this strong Army you're you're serious he can trust you you're responsible now he can pour
32:16
the anointing in you you're equipped and mature not a kindergarten anymore so now
32:21
God's kingdom can advance this vision and assignment he has here it can advance so much more that's one of the big reasons why he needs you to be
32:27
planted one place otherwise you're useless you're just taking up a seat but
32:34
you're not actively doing things for God's kingdom
32:41
amen so so to answer to answer that question make sure that you God it's
32:48
important you are sewing your seed your like this is my seed to give my tithe
32:54
and more to where I am and planted sometimes if God's moving your
33:00
heart to give other places that's that's fine but just make sure you're protecting the seed where you are
33:07
planted make sure you're not giving a crumb here a crumb here and a crumb here when God is calling you to sew bigger
33:13
here so he can release more to you there
33:22
amen all right so um I'm going to teach you now what happens when you sew because many people
33:31
they they they are treating giving and offering as such a
33:38
tradition the giving and offering they just they don't know the real power of it many people think it's just simply a
33:45
donation but it's not it's so much more than that so today
33:50
you're going to learn what happens when you sew amen okay so number one
33:59
when you sew you are giving something of such
34:06
value to God directly if Jesus was here in person
34:13
wouldn't you love to give him a gift like a physical gift many other things
34:19
too hug him and everything but wouldn't you love to give him a physical gift
34:25
something very precious ious something very valuable you get to do that when you
34:31
give offering when you give offering to the house of God you are giving directly
34:37
to God because it's God's house Jesus is the king here nobody else he is the king
34:43
here he is the leader here and so how it works in the spiritual realm when you give offering when you sew you are
34:50
giving to God directly and this is not just like oh it
34:56
makes you happy to be able to give this blesses God's heart this touches him so
35:03
much when you give something that has value like money money is valuable to
35:09
all of us on this Earth because we need it to survive number one number two a lot most everyone has
35:18
dreams that are not bad dreams but require a lot of money a house especially when you live in LA a house a
35:25
car these are good things to dream we we need we need cars to get to church
35:33
today right and we should have a a nice place to lay our head that a place that's peaceful so that we can be taking
35:40
care of our body so we in addition to our soul and spirit so we can be the
35:45
best vessel of God we can be it's a good desire to desire a nice place to
35:51
live it's not selfish or something no amen so we have these good desires and
35:58
they cost money so therefore money is valuable to
36:04
us to every person to some it's a God to others not but to those who it's not a
36:11
God it is still valuable and so when we give our own
36:17
money to God he sees that we are giving something that's valuable to us he sees
36:23
that we are bringing sacrifice to him simply because we love love him and we
36:28
trust him and we want to obey him in touch his heart so it indeed touches
36:34
God's heart so much throughout the Old Testament when it speaks of people giving
36:39
sacrifices over and over again in the Old Testament it's constantly saying
36:45
this is such a sweet Aroma that comes to God God is pleased by this it's like
36:50
this sacrifice is a sweet Aroma to him and um
36:57
it says it says in
37:03
Philippians
37:11
45 as Paul speaking now as you know you Philippians you people in the Church of this city like Philippi were the only
37:18
ones who gave me financial help when I first brought you the good news no other
37:24
Church did this even when I was in thessalonica you sent help more than
37:30
once I don't say this because I want a GI from you rather I want you to receive a reward for your
37:37
kindness and I'm going to uh uh skip on to this NE this next verse uh to verse I
37:45
believe 18 it is the the gifts that you have given me they are a sweet smelling
37:53
sacrifice that is acceptable and pleasing to
37:58
God and this same God who takes care of me will supply all of your needs from his glorious riches which have been
38:03
given to us in Jesus Christ look at this this is not just the Old Testament that this is a principle that when you
38:09
sacrifice it is a sweet smelling sacrifice that is pleasing to God it's
38:15
in the New Testament Church Hebrews 13:16 this is New
38:20
Testament also it says do not neglect to to do good and to share what you have for such sacrifices are pleasing to
38:31
God so imagine every time you sew in the house of God God literally is receiving
38:39
it I am touched my son has blessed me my
38:45
daughter has blessed me isn't that
38:50
powerful people have been giving in the church thinking it's just a donation missing this revelation that
38:57
this is a precious intimate moment with God where you are literally touching his
39:03
heart this is just the Bible what it's saying amen and it says in 2 Corinthians 9:7
39:11
for God loves a cheerful
39:18
Giver so the meaning of that is that when you give cheerfully give to the house of God give
39:25
to God through the house of God this is him I love that you did that
39:32
I love you and I love that you did that that touched my heart that's what's happening when you give every time you
39:37
give isn't that powerful you got to renew your mind every time you give to receive God's love for you some of you thinking God doesn't love you and he's
39:43
doing this over you as you're given you ever think I'm just giving a donation I wish I could hear God's voice telling me
39:49
he loves me renew your mind this is the word this is what the word says so this is what's happening as you give every
39:55
time you could be hearing God's voice telling he telling you he loves you and is proud of you every time you
40:03
give that's one of the biggest ways to hear God's voice is to read the word and
40:10
bring it to remembrance and renew your mind I am doing this now that God told
40:15
me to do right now he's seen me do this and he loves when I do this and it
40:21
touches his heart when I do this so right now he is saying I love you I am proud of
40:27
you that's one of the biggest ways to hear God's voice amen Renewing Your Mind it's not
40:34
the audible and some big feeling this is one of the biggest ways to hear his voice
40:42
Hallelujah so that's number one what happens when you sew is you get to give directly to
40:52
God this is one of the big ways that you express him in a way that is pleasing to to him your Thanksgiving and your love
40:58
to him number two when you sew you are
41:05
literally advancing God's kingdom when you sew into the house of
41:11
God that seed does not go to waste it is literally making the kingdom of God to advance more because of that seed you
41:20
sowed this is the way that God makes the kingdom of God to advance physically and spiritually one of the big ways is
41:27
through the seed God I mean first of all we need
41:32
physical things to do the ministry we we need resources we this
41:39
place costs thousands of dollars per month to to
41:46
rent we have all these different expenses to pay just to have um a place
41:52
for people to give um just to have insurance
41:58
um we have all this different equipment for you to be able to hear we we heard what happened when we didn't have my mic
42:04
on we can take it for granted we needed resources money to buy a microphone and
42:10
the speakers and the lights and all the soundboard and the computers and the cameras and the tripods all of these
42:17
things they take resources and so millions are receiving
42:23
online right now encountering Jesus
42:30
Hallelujah but if there was Zero physical resources no one would even be here in this room right now and no one
42:36
would be receiving cuz all of you are here because you've heard about it online we
42:43
used to be a group of two people at one time two to three people and so they
42:50
wouldn't have found out about it if God didn't do powerful things making videos
42:55
go viral spiral and word spread Hallelujah but it was because we
43:01
had cameras at the time people gave so we could have my
43:07
parents they gave Jean Tal's parents they gave so we could have these
43:12
resources cameras and everything and phones Hallelujah and
43:18
microphone and God wants to do more he doesn't want us to stay in the
43:25
same place so so to to to do more it takes also more
43:31
finances as we grow we will we're needing going to need a bigger place and
43:36
that will cost more to have a bigger place is going to cost
43:41
more so every time you are giving to the work of God it's literally making the the kingdom of God to advance this is
43:47
God's way he doesn't his way of releasing um finances for the things that are needed because we live on this
43:54
Earth and we need the physical things to to do the spiritual things amen um he
43:59
doesn't have money just fall from the sky and he doesn't just like send a
44:05
millionaire to come give no he uses his children his normal average
44:14
children from different backgrounds different ages whatever he uses you to
44:19
advance God's [Applause]
44:25
Kingdom and it says in Luke 8 vers1 soon
44:32
afterward Jesus began a tour of the nearby towns and Villages preaching and announcing the good news about the kingdom of God he took his 12 disciples
44:40
with him along with some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases among them were Mary Magdalene from whom
44:47
he had cast out seven demons Joanna the wife of chuza herod's business manager
44:52
Susanna and many others who were contributing from their own resources to
44:57
support Jesus and his disciples so we see this example of
45:03
Jesus's own Ministry it was the people who would come to be part of his ministry who had been set free of demons
45:10
for example it was them who were contributing from their own finances to
45:17
make the kingdom of God to advance through Jesus Hallelujah this is this is God's
45:25
way we see 1 Corinthians
45:31
9:13 do you not know that those who officiate in the sacred Services of the temple eat from the temple and those who
45:38
regularly attend the altar have their share from the offerings brought to the altar so also on the same principle the
45:46
Lord directed those who preach the gospel to get their living from the
45:52
gospel so according to this word it's saying those who preach the the gospel should get their living from the gospel
45:59
meaning the offering part of the offering should go to the minister that's what the word of God says and so
46:06
even when you are sewing into the work of God you're also making that the the
46:12
preaching that has blessed you that has touched you you're making that to be able to continue and go
46:19
further Hallelujah so this this belief that
46:25
preachers should just um donate their time and work elsewhere
46:33
to be ministering is a full-time job and so that's really not proper
46:39
Doctrine um true ministers who are ministering full-time they shouldn't
46:45
have to go get another job if they were having to go get another job then that
46:51
means that they are they are not they don't have the capacity they have to sleep they have to rest and there
46:57
wouldn't be time for that and so it means that when they go to minister they're not able to be the best that God
47:03
wants them to be amen
47:10
hallelujah so the third thing um that happens when you
47:16
sew is you reap Supernatural
47:24
blessings 2 Corinthians 9:
47:30
6 we're going to read 68 and 10 through 11 here remember this a farmer who plants
47:38
only a few seeds will get a small crop but the one who plants generously
47:43
will get a generous crop and God will generously provide all you need then you will always have
47:49
everything you need and plenty left over to share with others for God is the one who provides seed for the farmer and
47:56
then bread to eat in the same way he will provide and increase your resources
48:01
and then produce a great harvest of generosity in you yes you will be
48:06
enriched in every way so that you can always be generous and when we take your
48:11
gifts to those who need them they will thank
48:20
God Hallelujah Hallelujah hey I'm sorry I
48:26
want to skip back to the the second the second um the second thing that happens
48:31
when you give and I just want to just make sure I mentioned this verse 13 of 2 Corinthians 9 as a result of your
48:37
ministry of giving the people will give glory to God for your generosity to them
48:43
and to all believers will prove that you're obedient to the good news of Christ so this is powerful I just want
48:50
to just to add quickly on this what's happening as you advance God's kingdom he's saying that because you gave gave
48:56
people are now giving glory to God that there is a direct result of you giving
49:02
the kingdom of God is advancing and people are giving glory to God Amen back to number three reaping
49:10
blessings so um this is powerful this is a powerful scripture sharing this
49:16
principle of sewing so many Believers are missing out on receiving abundant
49:23
life because they don't understand this principle of sewing of sewing and
49:29
reaping that when you sew this is the way you reap more that when you sew you
49:36
get back what you have given and more this is what it this is what the
49:42
scripture is saying if a far farmer just plants a few seeds he will go only a small crop but the one who plants
49:48
generously will get a generous crop and then God will keep providing more
49:54
because he sees oh you are obedient to be a good swer I'm going to give you
50:00
more seed now and so then you give more because you trust God that he's gonna
50:06
gonna keep giving and so then you sew more and then you reap more you reap
50:11
more from what you've sown and God gives you even more this is what happens when you
50:20
s Genesis 2612 Isaac planted crops in that land
50:26
and the same year reaped a h hundredfold because the Lord blessed
50:32
him so he sowed and he reaped so much more than what he sowed 100 fold this is
50:40
going to happen in your life and it it looks like a different timeline sometimes sometimes you sew and
50:47
you receive like it seems like just back what you have swed for a while God can
50:53
take you through a season of this to test you to build your faith I was brought through a season
50:59
of um Financial stretching like never before when I first stepped into my calling of being an apostle and starting
51:07
the church I've never been stretched like that in my life and I was living so
51:12
minimally but I kept sewing I kept sewing I kept sewing through all of that
51:17
and it was um four and a half years of this of living minimally of not seeing
51:25
100 fold just getting back what I've sewed it seems like but it was adding up
51:30
in the spiritual realm and then there came a day where it's now where it's so much more than
51:38
what I have swed is what I reap and continue to reap in all areas of life and so this is
51:45
absolutely God's principle that is true for your life if you are faithful to so he absolutely will bring 100 fold you
51:53
will start seeing like your life changing in so much because of this
51:58
great reaping that has come from all those seeds you have sown it's like this
52:03
when you sew seeds um physical seeds they don't do much seeds by themselves
52:10
before they're put in the ground they don't do anything they're tiny they don't produce anything they're they do
52:17
nothing no good but you sell them you release them from your hands you don't
52:22
hold on to them you release them you sell them into the ground and you don't see anything for a little bit for a
52:30
while you see nothing you might have forgotten that you've sewed you just feel
52:35
like I don't know if that's ever going to I'm ever going to reap it it takes
52:42
time for plants to come out of the ground amen it takes time for the roots to go under and grow and become strong
52:51
but that at that perfect time it sprouts a a plant sprouts up a
52:56
tree sprouts up a Flower sprouts up and so if you throw all of these seeds into ground and there's so many seeds one day
53:03
it will be a massive field of plants that produce all this fruit that you can
53:11
eat flowers that are so beautiful they bless you to look at
53:16
them big trees that produce shade that blessed
53:21
you so much more you have reaped than what you have than what you
53:27
sewed that's the spiritual principle of sewing of sewing into God's kingdom
53:34
you're sewing it can be little what you have but you SE and it produces Supernatural blessings in your
53:42
life so so this this third this third thing that happens when you sew you reap
53:47
blessings different kinds of blessings you reap Financial
53:53
blessings every time time you sew into the house of God there is a reaping a
53:59
financial blessing reaping attached to it in some way if you are suffering financially
54:08
sewing is the spiritual principle to get out of poverty get out of debt get out
54:15
of lack it's like the word said if you if you so very tiny you're going to stay in
54:22
that same place
54:27
Proverbs 11:24 give freely and become more wealthy be stingy and lose
54:33
everything the generous will prosper those who refresh others will themselves
54:38
be refreshed Luke 6:38 passion translation give generously and generous gifts will
54:45
be given back to you shaken down to make room for more abundant gifts will pour out upon you with such an overflowing
54:51
measure that it will run over the top your measurement of generosity becomes a measurement of your
54:58
return so this all of these scriptures this applies to your financial life this
55:05
is what opens up doors of Supernatural Financial blessings to you and it is
55:11
God's will for you to have abundance this is going to look different for everybody some people are
55:16
called to be millionaires for God's glory to invest into the kingdom to use
55:23
all of the seed for what God wants to do big things with these Financial
55:29
Resources God has given for his kingdom others aren't called to be millionaires but every one of you is
55:35
called to not be in poverty and is called to have more than enough is
55:41
called to have seeds in your hand to sew and the seeds to increase so you can sew
55:46
[Applause] more yes this is God's calling for you to not be stressing over bills your
55:54
whole life that's poverty and that's not God's portion for you that's not these
55:59
principles if you do these principles you will see yourself get out of poverty you will see Abundant Life come to
56:06
you amen and so all of these um scriptures I just read also the
56:12
scripture in Malachi ma uh 3:10 bring all the ties
56:18
into the storehouse so there will be enough food in my temple so this is speaking of actually the the the the
56:24
storehouse is the purp the purpose of the storehouse is to sustain the priests and the Levites which were the leaders
56:30
in the temple at that time it was a specific area of the temple in Jerusalem that housed tithe tithed grain and other
56:38
resources so it's in today's time is speaking of the house of God to sustain
56:44
the work of God bring all the tithes into the storehouse if you do I will open the
56:51
windows of Heaven for you I will pour out a blessing so great you won't have room enough to take it in try it put me
56:57
to the test God is saying put me to the test because he's so badly wants to release
57:04
these blessings to you but he can't go against his principles you're crying out for certain
57:09
things you're crying out for your bills to be paid things like this and he's saying I have these ready but I need you
57:16
to test me in this and so it's not just Financial blessings so
57:21
it is financial blessings always whenever you seow you can know that the reaping is going to be connected to your financial blessings
57:28
and protection over your finances but number two it's also the
57:34
seed you're sewing is also connected to spiritual needs that you have and
57:40
physical needs that you have all of these verses where it's where it's saying I will pour out a blessing it's
57:47
speaking of finances yes but it's also speaking about your physical and spiritual
57:52
needs the things you're crying out to God and praying to God for many times it's connected to the
57:59
seed many times it's it's specifically what he's saying here when you sow I
58:05
will pour out this blessing so if we can just be obedient
58:11
and sew and do what God says we are making sure that every door is opening
58:16
that's supposed to open from God to receive all the blessings and needs that we
58:23
have amen we don't have to worry about it like what do I need to do to get this
58:28
blessing no just be obedient just follow God's principles be a generous sewer and
58:33
then everything will be released to you that's supposed to be released to you it's not about like I'm paying God
58:41
to give me this no sewing is nothing about paying God it's a spiritual
58:47
principle of bringing sacrifice of doing what he's commanding you to do of advancing his kingdom of of sewing into
58:55
his anointed ground and reaping from it what you sew has nothing to do with like
59:01
a transaction or paying God to give you something it's just that some blessings
59:07
are are reaping blessings that are going to come to so to receive the reaping
59:12
it's not a transaction it's a reaping to receive the reaping you have to
59:18
sew amen
59:26
so the blessings that you will reap when you sew are going to be Financial are
59:32
going to be the needs certain needs you have and also accessing Abundant
59:40
Life all that that means getting out of the deficit and into the
59:46
abundance comes as you sow sewing is one of the ways one of them principles that
59:52
we access Abundant Life so many Believers today because they're thinking that giving is just about a donation or
59:58
something and they don't have this Revelation they are unnecessarily missing out on abundant life because
1:00:03
they're not sewing so they can't reap when you take sewing seriously you
1:00:09
will see Abundant Life come to you in every area
1:00:16
amen hallelujah also the ground you sew in
1:00:23
matters the ground you sew into matters you
1:00:30
can't just sew anywhere you got to sew into God's true Kingdom his real Church where his power
1:00:38
is now you come here and you seow your time and you seow your energy to listen
1:00:47
and receive anointed word and you reap don't
1:00:52
you you reap deliverance from the word you reap your
1:00:59
life changed you reap maturity in Christ in
1:01:05
your life now you reap being a Victorious vessel of God over the
1:01:12
devil amen you you reap your spiritual eyes
1:01:17
open up to see in the spiritual realm and to see God's love like never
1:01:23
before you you you you reap receiving deliverance and healing by the anointing that is released here and impartation
1:01:31
you reap being able to walk in God's power yourself because you because you've sewed here your time your
1:01:39
attention right so where you seow in those aspects
1:01:45
matters right because you don't reap those things where God's power is
1:01:51
not you listen to message after message but you don't change you stay the same
1:01:57
right you receive prayer and prayer and prayer but nothing changes because there's no anointing there right okay so
1:02:04
it's the same principle when it comes to the seed that you bring to the house of
1:02:10
God if you're sewing to where God's power is you're not going to be reaping
1:02:17
anointed blessings upon your life but when you sew into a anointed
1:02:24
ground you are sewing into this anointing
1:02:30
directly so it's not just about the Miracles that you receive here as I declare the word but you are receiving
1:02:37
Miracles that come as you sow this reaping is Supernatural anointed
1:02:45
blessings Supernatural protection over your
1:02:51
finances powerful amen it's powerful so you it matters where you
1:03:02
sew and the fourth thing that sewing does is it transforms
1:03:09
you Matthew 19:21 Jesus told this rich man that's
1:03:16
saying I want to inherit eternal life what do I need to do and Jesus told
1:03:21
him if if you want to be perfect go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor and you will have
1:03:28
treasure in heaven then come follow me but when the young man heard this he went away sad
1:03:34
for he had many possessions then Jesus said to his disciples I tell you the truth it is very hard for a rich person
1:03:40
to enter the Kingdom of Heaven I'll say it again it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a
1:03:47
rich person to enter the kingdom of God but I just said God's calling some
1:03:53
people to be millionaires
1:04:00
right the meaning the meaning of this scripture the meaning of this
1:04:06
scripture is that this rich person as is the case for
1:04:12
many people especially everyone in the world money is their
1:04:18
Idol money has a hold on them they worship money not like they're worship
1:04:24
shing with their hands praising the money but they're worshiping the money with their
1:04:29
life they're Addicted to Money getting more money they were addicted to
1:04:35
physical things they're addicted they got to have the next car the next um
1:04:41
phone that's it comes out or something and they got to have the next the the the fan the fanciest jewelry the designer this and that they have to
1:04:48
they're addicted to that to money it's a God in their life and so you cannot have
1:04:55
two gods and so Jesus gave a prophetic instruction for this
1:05:03
guy money is your idol and the prophetic instruction is to get rid of everything
1:05:09
you have because that's how you will kill that Idol doesn't mean that he was called to
1:05:16
live a life having nothing no but at that point in his life
1:05:21
to get that Idol gone this is what was
1:05:28
necessary amen and so how money should be is that it should
1:05:34
belong to God in your heart it should belong to God completely you should see a lot of people see 10% is God's now the
1:05:42
Bible talks about the tithe the tithe is is God's and it talks about how we we're
1:05:48
robbing God if we don't give the tithe now this was written in the Old Testament but there's there's many
1:05:54
things that still apply in the New Testament today and what I do know is that God is calling us to be generous
1:06:00
and if we think that 10% is if we think 11% is
1:06:07
generous we got a problem so it's not like you have to give 10% God wants us
1:06:14
to give cheerfully right it's not a law anymore but it is a serious instruction
1:06:20
to be generous and so I would say God does want us to give far above 10% to
1:06:25
him so we still should make it a practice to give the tithe and think of it this way like this belongs to God I
1:06:31
do I I have the fear of God I do I do not want to be messing with the tithe and like with like withholding it
1:06:38
like I I'm making sure we got at least the tithe I don't want to rob from God
1:06:44
even though it's SS like a it's not like it's a law anymore but it's like in the law it's like when you didn't do these
1:06:51
things it was like damnation and just the sin was stuck on your life
1:06:59
but now when we don't obey God's commands it's not like that but it does open up doors to the enemy and it does
1:07:07
keep us from living Abundant Life accessing Abundant Life and it does keep us from pleasing God so it's like we
1:07:14
don't have to do these things but why wouldn't we why wouldn't we
1:07:20
amen hallelujah so um all of your we we should see that 10%
1:07:26
absolutely belongs to God but we really should see that all of it belongs to God and we should have the heart of Lord all
1:07:32
of this belongs to you I know I worked for it but you gave me the job and you gave me breath in my lungs a brain and
1:07:39
ability in my hands to be able to work the job you
1:07:44
know and so we shouldn't be like I worked hard for this this is mine I deserve this I'm going to go treat
1:07:49
myself no sometimes God will want you to treat yourself yes but let it be up to
1:07:56
him let it be this is yours Lord what do you want to do with it when When God
1:08:02
says go treat yourself with something and say okay Lord I Thank you And and feel God's love as you buy the thing not
1:08:09
like it's separate your your shopping life is separate from God you know
1:08:15
that's how you should see your money and so that's why to have a lot of money isn't a bad thing if this is your heart
1:08:25
it means that you're going to be it means that you're going to be sewing like all of it or most of it which is a
1:08:32
lot like if you have a million dollars it means you're going to like be sewing it all at one point but then God gives
1:08:38
it all back and more and then you release it again like that's that's that's how it
1:08:44
will work but if you have an idol of money you are not going to be sewing
1:08:49
like this and it's not going to belong to God's it's going to be belong to you
1:08:55
and you're not going to use it how God wants it to and it's going to be your God it won't God won't be your
1:09:00
God and so this is rare that people can get to this place today but it's
1:09:06
possible and this is what God wants for you and so um for a lot of people money
1:09:12
is an idol and the way that it becomes not our Idol anymore is to do this is to
1:09:20
give it is to sew this instruction he gives the rich
1:09:25
guy this is what he instructs all of us to do all the time it just looks different it might not be 100% it might
1:09:32
not be all your possessions but he's saying I want to get rid of this Idol completely out of you so release it give
1:09:39
it to me and this is how I get the idol of money out of your heart this is how I
1:09:44
transform your heart to be to that place where you see everything that you have belongs to God not you it's by giving
1:09:52
that's the way Matthew 6:21 for your heart will always
1:09:58
pursue what you value as your treasure your heart your heart will
1:10:05
always pursue what you value as your treasure so if you're valuing money so
1:10:10
much your heart is pursuing money but God wants you to get to this
1:10:16
place where you spiritually make your heart to
1:10:21
pursue God's Kingdom which means you're you're putting your treasure
1:10:28
there the the idol of money you're putting it in God's kingdom and as you
1:10:33
do that it transforms your heart where your heart is truly now pursuing what you now truly treasure
1:10:40
that you've shown through action through sacrifice through Obedience of sewing now you truly treasure and value God his
1:10:47
kingdom amen so as you give you should be excited like this is literally one of
1:10:52
the ways that God transforms your heart to be generous amen when you give every time
1:11:00
it's exciting like I'm giving now and God is literally transforming my heart to be more like him to be more
1:11:06
generous this is exciting I don't have to worry about misusing God's money because I'm being obedient in this way
1:11:13
and God is transforming my heart through this amen hallelujah praise God praise
1:11:22
God amen so all of these powerful things are
1:11:29
happening when you every time you sew into God's kingdom amen you are giving directly to
1:11:38
God you are advancing God's kingdom you are reaping all kinds of blessings
1:11:44
Supernatural blessings from God and you are being transformed more into God's
1:11:50
image having more of a heart like his a surrender heart that he can trust that
1:11:56
he can trust with more so you can do bigger things for God's kingdom amen
1:12:02
powerful amen hallelujah are there any cheerful givers
1:12:09
[Music] here hallelujah hallelujah
