Matthew 5 43 it says you have heard that it was said love your neighbor
0:06
and hate your enemy but I tell you love your enemies
0:12
and pray for those who persecute you that you may be children of your father
0:17
in Heaven today we're going to learn how to love our enemies
0:22
[Music] amen this is a command this is this is a word
0:30
you might have skipped by or forgotten but it is there it says love your enemies it says it's
0:36
basically saying the world's way says hate your enemies you don't gotta love your enemies love those who are nice to you but
0:44
but I say God says my way is different I want you to love your enemies
0:51
and when you do that you will be children of your father in Heaven another translation says love love your
0:59
enemies pray for those who persecute you and that's how people will know that you are children of God
1:05
that's how people will see a difference in you that's how people will see a love that they have not seen the world has
1:13
love there's tons of love but it's not the love of Christ
1:19
it's not real love it's not unconditional love the way people can see Jesus's love
1:25
through you and see that it's different from other love they've experienced love from their family love from their
1:31
boyfriend girlfriend spouse's children is when they see this unconditional love that you would even love your enemies
1:39
that's what God is saying we need to reveal God to this earth and this is how we do it this is how we do it this is
1:47
the the summary of how we reveal God to this Earth so people can know him and be
1:54
drawn to him and find him and know that he's a god of love is simply when we
1:59
love loving God's way love our enemies
2:06
bless those who persecute us amen
2:12
so today we're going to learn I mean maybe you read that scripture before but maybe you find like it's impossible for
2:18
you maybe you don't know how you're supposed to do this because you feel like you can't maybe you feel helpless
2:25
so I'm gonna help you today I'm gonna share this teaching is to help you to open your eyes in the spiritual realm to
2:31
help you to be able to love your enemies now one one of the reasons why it's really hard for us to love our enemies
2:38
is that when when people do bad things to us
2:44
we feel like it's not fair right that's the natural feeling like how come you
2:49
can do something horrible to me I did nothing wrong I'm innocent and nothing
2:55
happens to you and you just get to do whatever you want and you can
3:00
do that to other people now too and just get away with it that's not fair there needs to be Justice
3:06
am I right that's kind of how we feel inside and this is the biggest reason why it keeps us from really genuinely
3:14
loving our enemies so I want to help you out with that it says
3:21
in Romans 12 19. this is the Amplified version beloved never avenge yourselves
3:28
but leave the way open for God's Wrath this is New Testament by the way leave the way open for God's Wrath and
3:36
his judicial righteousness for it is written in scripture vengeance
3:41
is mine I will repay says the Lord but if you're and I'm going to read the
3:47
passion translation right now of the same verse beloved don't be obsessed
3:52
with taking Revenge but leave that to God's righteous
3:58
Justice for the scriptures say vengeance is mine
4:03
and I will repay says the Lord so
4:10
our God is a God of Justice and his Justice does not fail
4:16
it's perfect God's not sleeping
4:21
he sees it all he sees everything and he is a God of Justice through and through
4:28
now a big reason why we feel like man we need to make sure Justice is done we
4:34
need to make sure the truth is known and the truth is known that our enemy did
4:40
this bad thing to us and we're innocent all of this the reason we feel that way also is because
4:46
the world's justice system is flawed there's discrimination there's bias
4:52
there's racism and we're just humans um I've seen documentaries and news
4:58
stories that people falsely accused of murder it happened in L.A I saw something I
5:04
think somebody sometimes at a doctor's doctor's game and that's how they were able to prove that he wasn't a murderer
5:09
this happened in La I just came across that this week I don't I think it happened years many years ago but anyways like that's our world where our
5:17
justice system is flawed and so we can't depend on America's justice system the
5:23
court system we can't depend on the world's justice system we go to different countries whatever country you're from you can't
5:28
depend on that and that's not a great feeling right because you could be innocent and
5:34
you could be seen as guilty your whole life and no one could ever know the truth
5:40
but our God's justice never fails and how do but how do we receive God's
5:47
justice is by serving him when we give our lives to him
5:54
when we serve him with all our heart this is where we reap the Abundant Life
6:01
that Jesus Paid across for paid on the cross for us which includes so many things many of us are not aware of in
6:08
the body of Christ there's so many rewards there's so many benefits there's so many Supernatural blessings that come
6:15
with what Jesus did on the cross for us that comes when we give our lives to him wholeheartedly surrender and serve him
6:23
not just be a lukewarm Christian you can't access things being a lukewarm Christian you can't access these things
6:29
not being fully surrendered to God but when you are fully surrendered to God you access all of this Abundant Life and
6:35
that Abundant Life includes the justice of God over you
6:41
that's why no matter what it is in in life we don't have to be a worried uh
6:47
that we will be unfairly uh or accused of something we didn't do and no one
6:52
will ever know the truth we don't have to be afraid of that we don't have to be afraid that we'll be thrown into jail and
6:59
be and some of somebody thought we did something we didn't do and no the truth never comes out we don't have to be
7:04
afraid of that why because our God's justice never fails it never fails amen
7:11
Hallelujah God Is So merciful he's full of forgiveness he's full of compassion but these things come with repentance we
7:20
have to actually turn to Jesus to receive these things so there could be enemies in your life that are not repenting or not turning to
7:27
Jesus and the wrath of God will come there will have to be some pain as it
7:32
says and even when even when your enemies
7:37
repent even when your enemies are Christians and messed up and repented there is a principle in the Bible of
7:45
sowing and reaping that is just a law in the spiritual Realm
7:50
and we can't we can't get away from what you sow you will reap
7:56
and this is common sense and this is like we it's it's inevitable
8:02
if you if you disvalue somebody this value will come to you in some way
8:09
through someone will disvalue you if you the angry lash out speak mean to
8:15
somebody somebody's gonna be angry lash out to you if you gossip about somebody somebody's
8:24
going to be gossiping about you if you try to steal if you steal something from somebody something's
8:30
going to be stolen from you if you try to if you do somebody wrong in some way
8:36
somebody's gonna do wrong to you if you're withholding from God you are
8:43
not gonna you're gonna have financial problems for example this is a law in the spiritual realm it
8:49
is a principle the Bible says God is not to be mocked whatever you sow you will reap
8:56
so I want you to understand something first of all number one is that when enemies do you wrong do you
9:04
harm you need to stop thinking that they can just get away with it
9:11
the truth is that when they do you wrong in the spiritual realm it's like they're they are reaping exactly what they did
9:17
towards you but worse because you're innocent and God will lift you despite all of the damage that
9:24
was caused where harm will be caused to them but
9:30
there won't be the grace of God and the lifting of God upon their life
9:36
but we forget this or we don't realize this in the spiritual realm and so all we tend to see is that's unfair they
9:43
need to know that I'm right they need to know that I'm in the right they need to know that I'm innocent they need to know
9:49
what this person did to me we that that the heart of Justice
9:55
kind of comes up we need to be still and let God fight
10:01
our battles for us we need to be still and let God do be
10:07
the Justice the God of Justice we we don't have that right and
10:14
authority to to be a judge we were never given that we were all Sinners we all needed God's
10:21
forgiveness all of us yes other people have done worse things maybe than you
10:27
have done but we are all sinners and we all needed God's forgiveness we were not born perfect like Jesus
10:35
that's what gives God the ability to judge God's the only one that can rightly judge
10:40
it's like they don't just put anybody in the seat of the judge in the courthouse in the world right
10:47
no but they the qualified one the one that will really be able to judge without bias
10:53
maturely and really look through the evidence that person gets to be the judge
10:59
so that's how it is with God we cannot be the judge we think somebody did so much wrong to us when we might have done
11:06
worse to other people before we were saved or after we were saved we are in no place to be the Justice
11:13
person the judge that's just not our role and so there's something we really need to understand is that we need to really
11:20
stop with that not even go there in our mind like justice needs to happen and
11:25
just let God be the God of Justice just trust him just
11:35
you need to know that God he sees when you serve God
11:41
he is on your side there's nothing more powerful in this world than having God on your side
11:52
he's on your side when people come against you enemies do bad things against you God is on your side
12:00
he will lift you in due time amen
12:06
and it says in the Bible that he prepares a table in the presence of your
12:11
enemies that's our God who's on your side he prepares a table for you
12:18
meaning blessings and blessings and reward for serving him
12:24
is at this table and he makes sure the enemies can see it
12:35
hallelujah amen so we gotta first understand that our God's
12:42
justice is perfect and a we can just rest we don't need to be worried like are
12:48
they going to reap anything are they gonna get away with it I'm looking at their Instagram it doesn't look like [Music]
12:55
it looks like they're soaring what's going on we don't need to do that
13:03
just rest and know that God is the God of Justice
13:09
somehow he's up to something somehow there will be a reaping
13:14
and somehow God is going to lift you clear your name and make it seem that he
13:19
is with you God's timing is different than ours many times we want it to be sooner
13:26
than God's timing Joseph had to sit there in the prison
13:31
for a while but in God's perfect timing he raised him up
13:37
and it was seen that God was with him and his enemies his own Brothers came
13:44
begging him for food and he was in the position to give them
13:49
food it was seen we have the word of God to show us that our God is a God of Justice
13:55
amen um so I want to share you some examples of
14:01
what you sow you will reap so Saul tried to kill David he sent armies
14:08
after him trying to kill him because David did not do anything wrong but it made David look like suspicious why does
14:14
he want to kill him so bad you know so imagine David's that's going through David's mind like this is so unfair I
14:20
was only a blessing to him I was playing a harp and demons are being cast out of him and he's sending armies against me and his armies are willingly trying to
14:27
kill me that's not a a great place he had to
14:32
trust the God of Justice amen but God stood with him Saul could never
14:38
kill him and Saul tried to kill him but instead Saul ended up being dying in the
14:45
battlefields so what he sowed directly he raped
14:50
you see and then we see Judas he betrayed Jesus
14:57
he actually was the one that put things into motion for him to be crucified
15:02
so he was directly responsible for getting Jesus to be killed
15:09
but after he did that Judas opened the door for a demon of
15:14
suicide so what we read in the Bible is that he
15:20
hung himself so what happened was that door was open when he sowed that bad seed
15:26
a door was open for demon of suicide and the demon of suicide just
15:32
ran in his head rampant until he actually listened to the voice and killed himself so you see how he directly reaped what
15:39
he sowed David King David King David he
15:46
he ended up one time seeing his like friend and one of his best soldiers
15:54
he saw his wife bathing and he slept with her
16:01
and ended up impregnating her and um
16:06
what happened was he was trying to cover that up so he knew that he had he he decided he
16:12
wanted to kill Uriah was his name the husband of the woman he slept with
16:18
who was his good friend and best soldier in the army so he even in second Samuel 11 15 it
16:25
says he commanded this to his his army put Uriah in the front
16:33
in the face of the fiercest fighting then draw back from behind him so that he may be struck down and die
16:41
so David literally schemed planned to have him killed
16:47
and so he ended up repenting to God there's some who will do bad evil things
16:53
some of your enemies will do bad evil things and they won't repent but there will be some of your enemies
16:59
that will do bad things to you and they will repent and whenever nobody's too far gone
17:05
when we repent God will forgive and God can still use that person and that's what happened with David he still
17:11
ended up using David David still goes down as the man after God's Own Heart
17:17
after the horrible thing he did there was there was um Redemption there was restoration because he truly repented
17:24
with his heart it says um in second Samuel 13 3 David said to Nathan who's a prophet I have
17:31
sinned against Yahweh against God Nathan said to David Yahweh has also forgiven
17:37
your sin you shall not die but because you've utterly scorned Yahweh in this matter the son born for
17:43
you will certainly die then Nathan went to his house and Yahweh struck the child that the wife of Uriah
17:50
bore for David and he became ill now this is Old Testament so we have the
17:55
grace of Jesus now so the wrath of God isn't isn't the same as the Old Testament but the principle of what you
18:03
sow you will reap Still Remains amen
18:09
but did you see how David he killed the father and then death came upon his
18:14
child you see the sewing and the reaping okay I share with you I share this with
18:22
you now so you can this is going to help you rest because Justice is a good thing to have in your heart that's our God is
18:29
the God of Justice amen and it's not a good place to feel like
18:35
think people can just do whatever to you what's the point you know it's not a good place to be
18:40
so it's time today for you to have confidence in our God and just rest
18:47
and just know that God is truly finding your battles for you God is truly vindicating you
18:53
people aren't just getting away with what they did to you they may be showing that their life is
18:59
great but secretly they are tormented they've opened up doors for demons and secretly they're tormented they could be
19:05
having nightmares all the time they could be having voices of condemnation probably all the time that and on top of
19:12
that they're not doing the principles of reaping Abundant Life from God
19:17
so things can look great on Instagram but really they could be struggling in life a lot
19:23
because they're not sowing the good seeds to reap the supernatural blessings from God
19:29
oh man God loves everybody even when you make mistakes but if you're not sowing good seeds he can't pour His
19:36
Supernatural blessings upon your life you have to sow good seeds amen
19:42
Hallelujah so that's number one for you to understand that God is a God of Justice you don't have to worry anymore
19:48
he's got it in his timing truth will be revealed in
19:53
his timing it will be seen that God is with you and people cannot just get away with bad things they do to you so you
20:00
don't need to take it into your own hands anymore that's what that verse says in the passion translation
20:06
um do not be obsessed do not be obsessed with taking Revenge
20:11
do not be obsessed with wanting wanting this person to reap bad things you know
20:16
don't be obsessed with it but just rest and let God
20:21
be the God of Justice amen Hallelujah
20:27
thank you Lord okay so now we understand that God prepares it says
20:33
it says Psalm 23 5. you prepare a table before me in the
20:38
presence of my enemies you anoint my head with oil my cup overflows you prepare a table before me in the
20:45
presence of my enemy so this is what God does just like he did for Joseph like Joseph was lifted to the second highest
20:53
position there could be in that land in that country and his own brothers who
20:59
tried to kill him then sold him into slavery had to come to him for help and not only that saw him at this high place
21:06
saw that God was with him so God is going to prepare this table and the presence of your enemies but
21:14
there's something more that we need to understand it's not just like aha you
21:20
can see God is with me you know but
21:25
it's more of you know the Bible says God lifts the humble
21:30
he lifts the humble so the point of God preparing a table for you in the presence of your enemies
21:37
for them to all see is not to like laugh at your enemies and
21:42
say haha see you know but actually it's so that
21:48
people can see the glory of God through you and that people can see this is the way
21:55
to True Life by your example God prepares a table for you he brings
22:04
you all these blessings and favor and lifting in life he does that
22:09
to those of you that are really surrendered to God serving him with a pure heart who are representing him well
22:17
so he lifts you and people all the while have been watching you people all the
22:22
while have been seen how you responded to your enemies they've seen how you just are pure in
22:28
heart how you've shown Mercy compassion and Grace to those who are mean to you they've been watching you they've seen
22:36
you have a pure heart and now on top of that they see all these blessings upon your life it's like God is putting a
22:42
spotlight I am with this person and this is the way to to have God on
22:50
your side this is the way to reap all these beautiful blessings and have God lift you for his glory is to
22:57
be pure in heart is to love your enemies is to be gentle and kind and merciful
23:06
and forgive and have compassion this is the way
23:11
to fully surrender to Jesus obey him in everything be not of the world at all
23:19
but look like be like Jesus this is the way
23:26
this is the way amen so I mean that's the purpose of it God
23:32
lifts The Humble not just so you can like laugh at your enemies God doesn't prepare the table just you can laugh for
23:37
your enemies but as an example this is the way it's not the way to
23:44
accuse and slander and gossip about people this person didn't do that and I lifted
23:49
them this is the way learn from that we become examples for the people that
23:55
were our enemies so that they can repent and learn from our example
24:01
amen so it says in Romans 12 19 this is the
24:07
passion translation it says this is what I read before beloved don't be obsessed with taking Revenge but leave that to God's
24:13
righteous Justice for the scriptures say vengeance is mine and I will repay says the Lord and if you're and if your enemy
24:20
is hungry buy him lunch win him over with kindness
24:26
for your surprising generosity will awaken his conscience his or her
24:33
conscience and God will reward you with favor never
24:39
let evil defeat you but defeat evil with good
24:45
so it says your surprising generosity will awaken his his or her conscience
24:51
whenever we Face attack whenever we have enemies and such in life we need to
24:57
really go in the spiritual realm and remember why we're here we are not here to have ego we are not
25:05
here to have everyone be seen that we're in the rights
25:10
we're not here for that we're not here for people to look at us and say wow
25:15
that person's amazing we're not here for that we are here to lead people to Jesus
25:24
we are here to shine so brightly for Jesus we are here to emanate God's love
25:30
Mercy forgiveness we are here to be the light that looks so different from the
25:36
world that's why we're here so listen man when we have enemies coming against
25:43
this this is such a great opportunity to shine God's light
25:51
we take it too much personal so so much of the time we are not here for
25:57
ourselves we are here for Jesus we are here to lead people to Jesus so when we have an opportunity to love
26:04
when it's hard to be merciful and kind and generous to our enemies
26:10
this is actually exciting this is how God can be revealed to people like our enemies like never
26:17
before and so this is what this says right here
26:23
um if your enemy is hungry buy him lunch when I'm over with your kindness for your surprising generosity will awaken
26:30
his conscience and God will reward you with favor so your enemy was jealous of you maybe
26:37
envious of you just doesn't like you and so maybe they falsely accused you they
26:43
did bad things against you they gossiped about you uh and they're expecting you to come right
26:51
back in the same way but instead you buy them a lunch
26:57
instead you say nothing bad against them instead you bless
27:03
them you love your enemies and you bless those who persecute you
27:12
and what does the word say right here it says your surprising generosity will awaken
27:18
his or her conscience you see how different this thinking is
27:24
we're so into ourselves God they need to see you're with me no they need to
27:30
they need to find Jesus do we have a heart for all people we should have a heart for all people our
27:37
enemies or not we should have a heart for every person in this world to not go to hell
27:43
but to know Jesus whether they've done us wrong or not we should have a heart for them sometimes I think we need to think about
27:49
hell and do we do we can we have compassion for people do we really want people to go there
27:55
oh it doesn't matter the wrong they've done us bull
28:00
we've all done wrong that could be any of us so we need to see people with this compassion we need to see spiritually
28:08
this is a moment for their conscience to be awakened this is a moment for them to see wow I
28:15
didn't deserve this kind of love this is the love of God that I once knew
28:20
and I forgot for a moment and I became so in myself and got jealous and I did bad things and
28:26
this person didn't do anything bad to me and they're literally experiencing forgiveness compassion of God through
28:33
you when you're able to do that that's not you doing that humans without Jesus cannot do it
28:39
it's Jesus the kindness of God leads us to repentance
28:44
so the kindness of God through you they know they deserve bad things for what
28:50
they did but the kindness through you awakens their conscience and can lead
28:57
them to repentance they're experiencing the mercy of God and it brings them to brings them to him
29:05
convicts them part of the problem is many people have not seen examples like this so they're stuck in a circle of
29:12
just being mean to your enemies we need to be the light that the world
29:19
hasn't seen yet we need to show love that the world hasn't seen yet
29:25
there's some people who say they're Christians but they've never experienced this kind of love yet this is the time
29:31
God wants to show that love to them
29:39
we need to have the Heart of Jesus This Heart of Jesus that can you imagine
29:46
Jesus was persecuted by Saul Saul was killing so many people who were
29:52
Christians and Jesus says to him why are you persecuting me he was persecuting Jesus he was killing Jesus's beloved
30:01
children beloved disciples he was mass murdering them
30:07
and he all he says is why are you persecuting me and immediately there's no grudge from God
30:13
there's immediately just love and mercy and compassion he shows him he's convicted soft convicted and he
30:21
immediately repents like fully repents not halfway like fully repent and that's why we see that just this amazing grace
30:28
of God over his life because it was a full repentance that Paul had huge he went from completely blind to
30:35
completely seen not halfway not half Ferris the enemy anymore he went from fully persecuting Jesus 100
30:42
to serving him like the best of any disciples you know
30:49
but look I mean it's just so amazing Jesus doesn't like punish him or anything he's just like I want to use
30:55
you and what what happens is he blinds him so he reveals himself to him he says why
31:01
are you persecuting me and at this moment Saul knows oh my gosh I've been persecuting Jesus this whole time
31:08
he he already knows but then he blinds him not in the Natural Way in the his eyes and he actually sends him to his
31:15
servant he says go to ananias and he's going to open up your eyes and so in Acts 9 13.
31:22
it says Lord ananias answered so God's saying to
31:29
ananias I want you to open his eyes and like anoint him you know like he's he's called to be used by me so
31:36
Lord ananias answered I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm
31:41
he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem and he came here with authority from the
31:47
chief priests to arrest all who call on your name this guy
31:53
this is our biggest enemy can you imagine that we have enemies but they haven't killed us
32:00
they haven't killed our whole family in Christ almost but that's why ananias was experiencing
32:06
right there but the Lord said to ananias go this man is My Chosen instrument to
32:13
Proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel
32:21
God's like yup it's in the past I don't care this is my plan he's going to be used powerfully for my name for my glory
32:31
yes he did horrible things but I forgiven him completely he's a new man and I'm going to use them
32:37
I'm going to use them so powerfully he's going to write most the New Testament even I'm going to use him so powerfully
32:43
that in Acts 19 11 it says God did such extraordinary miracles to the hands of apostle Paul that even they would bring
32:49
handkerchiefs to his skin lame on the stick and even possess and the stick would be healed and the demons would flee it's the only time we're
32:55
extraordinary another translation says unusual it's the only time an apostle or a disciple is is is is is uh described
33:03
as walking in those kind of Miracles so this is our like wild
33:11
compassion forgiveness Redemption of our God this hard to even comprehend you know
33:18
but that's our God but like we have to you know ananias was
33:23
first like what do you mean like all of us would be but ananias didn't argue with God
33:31
he quickly obeys he says Whoa okay I'm confounded but I'm childlike
33:38
he was tired like he he gave God permission to confound him he confounded him so he immediately opens his eyes
33:47
and loves him as a brother in Christ
33:52
look at the heart ananias I think that's a special heart don't you that's kind of hard that's rare today
33:58
but that's the kind of heart that God is calling us to have this is why we have to love our enemies
34:05
some of our enemies God wants to use like Paul
34:10
it's really quiet whoops oh no
34:15
I mean maybe not but we gotta be open to that possibility we got to be okay with that
34:25
we gotta have a heart for everyone to be restored we don't know the reasons why people do
34:32
the bad things they do we're not God we are called to something very simple
34:37
to have a pure heart and love our enemies forgive them the Bible says forgive and
34:44
you will be forgiven did you know that so that means we have to forgive to be forgiven
34:52
there's a higher calling upon us than we really realize I think as the body of Christ
34:58
I hired calling to love our enemies forgive our enemies bless those who persecute us
35:08
and so I'm sharing now how can we love our enemies I just want to share with you just takes intention
35:16
you don't have to feel mushy gushy feelings that's not what love means
35:22
because I know many of you are in the Physical Realm and you think loving means like a natural love like how you
35:27
naturally love your children your best friends and your parents but that's not what the definition of God's love is
35:34
it's choosing to love it's choosing to be kind when people
35:40
don't deserve it it's choosing to not gossip and speak badly against them
35:46
it's choosing to instead of cursing them blessing them you feel a different way inside but you
35:52
say I bless them
35:58
pray for them may their eyes open up to God's love may they see what they've
36:03
done and be able to truly repent just like how Saul could truly repent and may they be restored
36:10
and may God still be able to use them so more people can come into the kingdom
36:16
we got to have that kind of heart too like we can't we can't reach all the people in this world
36:23
there's Souls who are going to be Paul's out there that God has to reach people in the
36:29
world we're going to see them in heaven and they're going to say I'm so glad that
36:35
I encounter the ministry of Apostle Paul of today
36:40
and we're gonna see them and we're gonna be like confounded you know
36:46
you see this Kingdom Heart we should have for the Lost we shouldn't have this selfish heart of
36:53
like well I haven't done bad things like my enemies have so I should be used powerfully by God and those people
36:59
shouldn't no we should we need to have a heart for the loss period we need to understand
37:05
that we need the whole body of Christ we can't reach everybody on our own we need to have the heart for the Lost
37:11
we need to have the heart for the loss to be found who are mean to us and for them to be used by God to reach other
37:17
lost people in the world it's like a simple kind of heart we need to have it's a different kind of focus where
37:23
we're turning the focus off ourselves and looking at Jesus's heart what does he want
37:29
amen um and
37:34
I know that like in the Christian world and some of you have experienced this I've experienced
37:40
it like never before even this year persecution is real it really happens it
37:45
really really happens when you start walking in the anointing God's shining a light upon you he's
37:51
lifting you he's showing he's with you fruits are being seen in your life
37:57
and there are jealous Christians out there that are just like the Pharisees
38:02
who will persecute who will try to speak bad things against you try to take you down if your
38:08
ministers or if you have Ministries try to shut down your ministry this will happen and this I know has
38:15
already happened to many of you this will happen so we need to be prepared
38:20
amen but the the greatest advice I can give you
38:27
is to keep up your heart you don't need to worry about lies
38:35
um standing when you keep a pure heart the lies Must Fall
38:42
but not if you become the LIE you know like not if you
38:49
become dirty in the heart and start attacking people back
38:58
people can see the dirt it will be revealed
39:03
but if you can keep a pure heart keep a pure heart towards your enemies
39:09
that will be revealed that will be seen
39:14
so you don't need to worry about the truth not coming out it will come out
39:19
just keep your heart pure and you will shine so bright
39:24
people can see the real people of God can see you
39:30
you don't need to worry about those friends in your life that that misunderstood you they weren't supposed to be with you to make you go higher
39:37
you need people who can really see your heart the pure in heart shall see God
39:44
you need pure people in your life the pure recognize Purity in your heart
39:50
those are the people you want don't care about Pharisees who can't see the Purity in you
39:56
they're not going to help you fulfill God's call for your life
40:02
it's better to have less friends than have a bunch of Pharisee friends
40:10
and they pollute the Pharisee friends pollute the gossip the attacking the accusation
40:17
they pollute the purity keep yourself pure
40:23
and I said it takes intention just take intention watch your tongue
40:29
be prepared for attacks that come enemies that attack you be prepared this is preparation for you right now
40:36
so you're not taken off guard when it happens and you're like oh there they and you start speaking bad things and
40:41
all it comes out of your mouth you're being prepared right now and start taking the intention right now
40:48
be prepared for that day of the evil one where that Pharisee attack comes towards
40:54
you be prepared for that day for you to not blow it for you to not curse your enemy and rip curse on your life
41:02
be prepared to speak only blessing and shut up
41:08
be prepared to shut up be prepared to be silent be prepared to be still
41:14
be prepared I'm prepared for this I thank God I see how he prepared me he took me through persecution and then a
41:20
bigger one and then a bigger one I thank God he trained me up I've been here before I know what to do now shut up
41:27
keep my heart pure do not look at what your enemy is doing stay focused on what God's called you to
41:34
do that's how you stay pure that's how I've been able to keep keep my heart pure there's so much God's call
41:41
me to do there's so much God's called you to do there's a lot you do not need to be distracted with watching your
41:48
enemies stay focused on what God's called you to do and when you stay focused that's
41:54
where God is putting more of his spirit in you transform in your heart more and more you shine more and more you keep
42:00
your heart pure you keep your heart pure and your enemies are at the table watching you but you're too high you
42:06
don't even see them you're shining so bright and your eyes
42:12
are locked with Jesus and the world gets to look and be amazed and be led to Jesus Through Your Light
42:19
God's calling us to be different to be pure to be pure through and through
42:26
amen Hallelujah Hallelujah
42:34
