Intro
0:00
I've been teaching a series on my new book The Secret of the
0:06
anointing Hallelujah I've been doing a series on
0:11
this book where I've been really expanding going more into depth from what I have written and so all of those
0:18
messages are on our YouTube channel um at fivefold church YouTube channel and
0:24
my YouTube channel Apostle kathern cck YouTube channel uh we have a playlist called sermons and they are all the
0:29
recent ones but if you haven't seen these past messages there's been several so go back and watch them all and
0:37
definitely get this book if you have not already uh it is God's will for you to
0:43
be a vessel of his anointing of his power the Bible says all who believe
0:49
these signs shall follow them some of them are they shall lay hands on the sick and they'll be healed they will cast out demons it is clear in the word
0:56
that it is God's will for every believer to be a vessel of him in his fullness his
1:02
power this is how people will really be saved healed and freed and have real
1:07
encounters with him so this is really important and it's not something to take lightly it's not like oh I should learn
1:13
about the anointing how to receive the anointing oh maybe if that's my passion I feel like God wants to use me as a
1:18
minister or to walk in Miracles no every one of you every
1:23
believer this should be crucial and critical and serious if you're not seeing the power of God in your life
1:30
move through you and touch others you need to take it seriously and learn and become a disciple and so today I'm going
1:37
to be teaching you how to be a faithful Steward of the
1:45
anointing [Applause]
1:51
Hallelujah so many people are always trying to
1:56
figure out what is my purpose what is my calling I want to know what it is I want to be doing that some people they they
2:04
get so Disturbed and anxious about it but you can breathe easier knowing this
2:11
powerful truth that when you surrender your whole life to God and when you
2:18
position yourself to receive anointing when you plant yourself in a church
2:24
where the power of God is Flowing upon your life so you can be equipped and receive impartation
2:30
you are now walking in your calling you are now fulfilling your
2:36
purpose with these two things you're surrendered to God
2:41
fully and you're positioned to receive anointing you're being positioned to be
2:46
equipped to grow and receive impartation amen it's simple it's not
2:52
difficult it's not hard and honestly you do not need to worry and try to figure it out what is my purpose if you are
2:59
surrendered and you are here in this place right now you are fulfilling your purpose you're walking in your calling
3:07
now hallelujah hallelujah some of you need to take that weight off your shoulders
3:14
and rest I've made it I'm here I've arrived I'm in God's will
3:21
Hallelujah yes and so um you know there's a calling and purpose upon
3:28
your life and it it's like the there is a fullness
3:33
to your calling and purpose I mean there's stages before we get there's a
3:39
journey before you get to like walking in the fullness but it doesn't mean that you're
3:45
not fulfilling your purpose until you reach the fullness amen um and
3:52
so today I'm going to be sharing about this place in between this place in
3:58
between um when you begin to step into your
4:04
purpose but you're not at the fullness of your purpose yet the journey in between there's
4:10
always a journey in between God says don't despise the day
4:17
of Small Beginnings for God loves to see the work
4:23
begin you have to start somewhere you have to start small you can't start big
4:30
God can't give you the big thing day one he'll give you the small thing and see what you do with it and
4:38
then it will grow from there
4:44
am Hallelujah uh Luke 16:10 if you are faithful in little things you will be
4:50
faithful in large ones but if you are dishonest in little things you won't be
4:56
honest with greater responsibilities so this is God's principle of testing you to see if
5:03
you're trustworthy he will give you a little bit and he will watch you and see what you do with it and if you pass the
5:10
tests and he sees you're faithful with what he's given you he will give you more this is a
5:18
principle but if you don't pass the test if you're not faithful you will stay in that same place or you may lose what he
5:26
has given you
5:33
Matthew 23:12 for those who exalt themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves
5:41
will be exalted so when you humble
5:48
yourself and when you are faithful with what God has given you God himself will see that and he
5:56
will exalt you for his glory he he will lift you for his glory he will lift you
6:02
to the next step and then the next step and then the next step until you've reach the place where you're walking in
6:09
the fullness of your calling the place that you're hungry
6:17
for so what you need to do is make sure you're positioning yourself to be lifted
6:25
for God's glory position yourself spirit itu so God can say I want to lift you
6:34
for my glory I want to take you to the next level I want to entrust you with
6:39
more it's not about sitting around and waiting to arrive somewhere you have to
6:47
position yourself so God can take you there himself so he can lift you
God can take you there
6:55
there and that's that's why it's the moment that you you surrender and you position yourself to receive anointing
7:02
you already starting to fulfill your purpose you're you're actively following God's will you're
7:10
actively going through tests and passing them so God can lift you you're active
7:15
you're not just sitting around waiting in the small beginning place you are doing powerful
7:23
things and there's no shortcut so it's NE necessary you're
7:30
doing you started the necessary Journey
7:37
Hallelujah for example um to share with you what I'm talking about about this
Starting the necessary journey
7:42
this journey when I surrendered to God I surrendered everything I told God that
7:50
he can have my my dreams my will my plans and he answered that prayer nine
7:57
months later I went to a conference in LA and my now spiritual father Prophet Dr jvy that's where I saw him Minister
8:04
for the first time and he prophesied to me that I was called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ and I was called to reach
8:10
the Nations and and I received that prophecy because I had positioned Myself by surrender for
8:19
God to lift me like how he found David in the
8:25
fields he found David positioned positioned in surrender
8:30
positioned with a pure heart and could lift him could call him and lift
8:36
him um but then after David was called in the field he had a
8:43
journey to get to the real fullness of his calling of being King walking in his
8:50
calling but he started really doing powerful things fulfilling his purpose already as he killed
8:58
Goliath you know but he still was in that middle ground in that Journey not to the real
9:04
arrival yet of the the fullness of his calling and for me I was called out of
9:12
the fields um the place of surrender but all these huge prophecies were
9:19
spoken over my life that God was going to use me to do many big Miracles
9:24
and about that year there was a prophecy from my spiritual father as as well over
9:30
LA and America saying that God has brought Revival to our land to our city
9:35
to our nation it's starting in La it's going to spread across the US and it's going to spread all over the
9:42
world so but so I I received all these huge prophecies but for four and a half
9:49
years since the first prophecy and about three and a half years from the second
9:55
prophecy it did not look like what was prophesied at all it did not look like
10:00
Revival I wasn't seeing God do all these Miracles through me I didn't feel like an apostle I definitely didn't feel like
10:06
an apostle of the Nations because our church had about 20 people the first year then went to 15 then went to 10
10:12
then went to five then to two by 2020 over those four and a half years so Revival is supposed to be this
10:20
massive growth and miracles and increase of Miracles but it looked like the opposite in terms of uh the growth we
10:28
were doing windling and I was seeing God move in power but I wasn't seeing any deliverance and very few
10:36
healings um but he had released his anointing to me he had released his
10:41
anointing to me though it was small in the beginning it was a small beginning and
10:47
the anointing he gave in the beginning was small was a small portion but it was anointing
10:54
nonetheless it was it was precious and powerful and something that I was not worthy or deserving of to be a vessel
11:02
of it was something that was so rare in the whole world and in the city of La
11:08
even though our church was small we would see God move in power we would see
11:13
people be touched by the prophetic word tears fall we would see sometimes people fall back with the power of God and have
11:19
encounters with Jesus we would see people be baptized in the Holy Spirit we we would see transformation
11:25
joh tall would really encourage me the first even just in the first year of of
11:32
the church she came and she was immediately uh transformed spiritually
11:38
like never before in her life she would testify to me so the anointing was there but it was
11:46
small and God was there watching what will I do with the small anointing he's
11:51
given me he's planned to give me a big amount for his glory to move through me
11:58
a big big amount but he cannot start with a big amount he has to start with
12:03
small what will I do with it now came the testing and God gave me various
12:11
different kinds of tests and these tests are the same kind of test that he's going to take you through as
12:19
well and I'm going to go over these different kinds of tests so you can be aware of them so you can be prepared for
12:25
them and so you can Ace these tests not failing not stay stuck but pass them and
12:30
go glory to [Applause] glory and not be late to the arrival of
12:39
your Promised Land of the fulfill of the fullness of walking in your calling or
12:44
that it would be aborted but that you would make it in on time so um for me I felt looking back it
12:54
it felt like I was pregnant pregnant with God's calling my
13:00
purpose pregnant with the anointing and then one day 4 and 1 half years later
13:07
the beginning of the fullness of my calling was
13:14
birthed when the first demon well when the video online went
13:19
viral and God started doing Miracles through the video and a couple months later when the first demon manifested out of a young woman and was cast out of
13:26
her and then it was Deliverance every week happening so many people set free
13:31
for me that was like the birthing of the the the the beginning of the walking in
13:37
the fullness of my calling like a baby and the baby grows we go higher and higher glory glory to
13:44
glory amen but um this is how it is like for you too you it's
13:51
like there's there's it's inside of you it's inside of you something
13:56
precious you can't see it very well people can't see it very well but it's there you have to care for it you have
14:03
to have intention every day I am carrying something so precious this
14:09
powerful anointing and God is watching to see what I will do with it I want to make sure I'm being a good Steward and I
14:15
want to make sure this anointing inside of me grows healthily and
14:21
strong and is not aborted or
14:26
sick amen it's God's will for every one of you to walk in the anointing you have
14:32
different specific callings not everyone is called to be a minister not
14:37
everyone's called to be a five-fold minister but you were all called to walk in the anointing you all all called to
14:43
carry anointing that makes demons tremble and so
14:53
Hallelujah and so whether you are called to be a minister a five-fold minister or
14:58
whe whether you are called to walk in the anointing in different spheres of life in different
15:04
Avenues uh and touching people in your workplace and your family and different places whatever it is these principles
15:11
remain the same these principles of receiving this small amount of
15:17
anointing and going through testing stewardship testing and God watching and
15:24
as you pass he releases more and more until you eventually begin to walk in
15:31
the fullness of your calling where that anointing has grown big in you it's
15:36
going to look like different amounts for every person the bigness of it but you're all called to carry a varying
15:44
degrees a big anointing
15:50
amen hallelujah Matthew
Matthew 2514
15:57
2514 this is a parable about what the kingdom of God is
16:07
like this is a little bit of a long passage but uh it's
16:14
important again it will be like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to
16:20
them to one he gave five bags of gold to another two bags and to another one bag
16:27
each according to his ability then he went on his journey the man who had received five bags of gold
16:34
went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more so also the
16:41
one with two bags of gold gained two more but the man who had received one bag went off dug a hole in the ground
16:48
and hid his master's money after a long time the master of these servants returned and settled accounts with them
16:56
the man who had received the five bags of gold brought the other other five Master he said you entrusted me with five bags of gold see I have gained five
17:04
more his master replied well done good and faithful servant you have been faithful with a few things I will put
17:11
you in charge of many things come and share your Master's happiness the man with two bags of gold
17:18
also came Master he said you entrusted me with two bags of gold see I have
17:24
gained two more his master replied well done good and faithful servant you have been faithful with a few things I will
17:29
put you in charge of many things come and share your Master's happiness then the man who had received one bag of gold
17:36
came Master he said I knew that you were a hard man harvesting where you have not sown and Gathering what you have not
17:42
scattered seed so I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground see here is what belongs to you his master
17:49
replied you Wicked lazy servant so you knew that I harvest where I have not swn and gather where I have not scattered
17:55
seed well then you should have put my money on deposit with the bank Anor so that when I returned I would have
18:00
received it back with interest so take the bag of gold with him and give it to the one who has 10 bags forever for
18:07
whoever has will be given more and they will have in abundance whoever does not
18:12
have even what they have will be taken from them and throw that worthless servant outside into the darkness where
18:19
there will be weeping and nashing of teeth the Amplified version of the last scripture says for to everyone who has
18:26
who for to everyone who has has and values His blessings and gifts from God
18:32
and has used them wisely more will be
18:39
given and he will be richly supplied so that he will have an
18:44
abundance but from the one who does not have because he has ignored or
18:50
disregarded His blessings and gifts from God even what he does have will be taken
18:57
away so this is the principle of stewardship
Stewardship Testing
19:04
testing that God takes you through this same kind of testing that we see in this
19:10
Parable God literally takes his children
19:15
through you have a pure surrendered heart I can see so I will give some
19:21
anointing to you a small amount and now I will see what you do with it he gives
19:27
it to you all here all of you who are surrendered with pure hearts he gives it all and then he watches which
19:34
ones value what I have given them which ones are spiritual enough to
19:41
see that it's not about uh feelings that it's not about physical results but who
19:48
is spiritual enough to to to know they have received powerful
19:55
anointing and that as they are faithful to release it how God is asking them to
20:00
powerful things will take place for God's
20:05
[Applause] kingdom who who will be faithful to
Who is Faithful
20:14
Value where they have received from seing change in their own
20:21
life believing that if this the Miracles and change has come to them through a
20:26
Ministry through through a church that planted and then impartation is released
20:31
are they valuing the directions the prophetic directions given the
20:37
instruction given are they valuing my way God's way of speaking and leading
20:46
you to walk in this anointing he's looking for all these things who is faithful with what I've given them and
20:52
who is not to the ones who are faithful I will add unto them they they've passed the
20:58
test and I will increase more to them God wants to give all of his children
21:05
Mighty amounts of anointing because that means that God's kingdom will advance more it means more people will be set
21:11
free healed and
Sewing and reaping
21:19
saved but but we have to pass the tests or you will not receive or will be taken
21:24
from you what you have received it's a principle of sewing and reaping this the scripture that says
21:30
those that have will have more those who don't have much won't have any well to
21:35
receive you have to seow the Bible says when you seow you reap
21:42
so if you're not sewing at all there's no way of receiving of reaping of
21:48
harvesting so that's a picture of what this is saying here for those who are who are releasing what I've given
21:54
them who are sewing the seeds I've given I put in their hands They will receive much more but those who have the the one
22:02
seed in their hand very tiny and don't do anything don't sew the seed they will
22:07
not receive anything more and it will be taken from
22:13
them
22:18
amen some of you are just sitting around like man I want to be used powerfully in
Its up to you
22:24
the anointing but you're forgetting you're disvalued that God's already giving you something
22:31
he's already giving you a measure of anointing and he and now it's up to you it's not the time to sit around and wait
22:38
it's up to you it's in your hands now go through the testing pass the
22:44
test receive more amen so I'm want to I'm going to go
Test of a Servant
22:51
through um different stewardship tests that God has taken me through and that he's going to be taking you through
22:58
the first kind of test is the test of a servant
23:03
heart Matthew 20:25 Jesus knowing their thoughts called them to his side and
23:09
said Kings and those with great Authority in this world rule oppressively over their subjects like tyrants but this is not your calling you
23:17
will lead by a completely different model the greatest one among you will live as the one who was called to serve
23:22
others because the greatest honor and Authority is reserved for the one with the the heart of a
23:29
servant so what God is looking for is that when you receive the promises from
Focus on Being a Servant
23:35
God exciting promises that you won't obsess over the promises and you
23:42
won't obsess over the dreams and you won't obsess with the promised
23:47
land but you would be solely focused on being a
23:55
servant that every day you would remind remind yourself I am a servant of the
24:01
Lord the more you are focused on being a servant the less you're focused on yourself the less you're focused on your
24:09
dreams you can't be focused on two you can't be like I want my will and I'm a
24:14
servant they don't mix together so the more you renew your mind
24:19
that I am a servant your eyes are on other people only you can't have your eyes on other people and your eyes on
24:26
yourself and so God will take you through this kind of testing to see if really you
24:33
have a servant heart and I went through quite a testing
24:38
of this and I'm so thankful I did because not only did it test me but it
24:45
stretched me it made my servant heart to
24:50
grow the servant heart that was there in the beginning it grew so much because of what God took me through where I would
24:58
either come out of it as a servant or I would give
25:03
up that was when I was leading the church for four and a half years when we
25:08
had about 20 15 people the first year and then 15 the next 10 sorry 10 the
25:14
next five the next two by 2020 and ministering twice a week every
25:20
single week and imagine how disheartening that is to hear these huge prophecies
25:28
and in my heart I really thought they were happening soon like that year and
25:34
when it didn't happen that year I really believed it was going to happen the next year and when it didn't happen that next
25:39
year I really believed it was going to happen the next year and then when it didn't happen the next year I really believed it was going
25:46
to happen the next year and then that that um what was it the fourth year it
25:51
was four and a half years from receiving the prophecy so I guess that's the fourth is that the fourth year or the fifth year fifth year beginning of the fifth
26:00
year yeah beginning of the fifth year so that fifth year was 2020 and at that
26:05
point instead of thinking it was going to happen this year I was like I don't
26:10
know when it's going to happen but it's okay I'm just a servant of the
26:16
[Applause] Lord yeah God really changed my heart to
God Changed My Heart
26:22
be like it doesn't matter it's okay I'm content I'm a servant of the Lord I know
26:27
it will happen I don't know when it's going to happen but it's okay if it doesn't happen this year cuz I'm a servant of the Lord that's all I am
26:34
that's all I care about is serving God obeying God not about
26:40
my promises and dreams coming true no I know they will I'm not going to be
26:46
obsessed and focused there I'm going to be focused on obeying God pleasing his heart amen so and that's when it
26:52
happened that's when it happened that's when um that's when the Revival broke out that year
27:00
Hallelujah um but I mean those four and a half years it was really disheartening
27:05
there were times when I would get up and um I remember we would sing worship nights it was John tall and I we would
27:11
sing and sometimes it was just her dad in the congregation sometimes it was just her mom in the
27:17
congregation um one time there was no one at all in the congregation just us there on on the
27:24
stage and this was in literally like three years 3 years later not just like
27:31
the first week and then it got better no this was it got worse it got
27:37
smaller and it was really difficult at times I remember being up there and
27:42
holding back tears and renewing my mind renewing my mind the promises will come
27:47
to pass and it's okay I'm just here to please God and serve him it's okay that
27:54
there's not many people here I'm just here to obey obey God that's all I care
28:00
about and um I remember God you know convicting me one time when I was
28:06
longing for growth and for the promises to be F
28:11
fulfilled after so many years God your Holy Spirit spoke to me and reminded me
28:18
that it is such a serious deal to to be
28:23
a Shepherd a pastor entrusted with people with people's spiritual
28:31
lives so even one person to be a pastor of even one person two
28:38
people is a huge honor is a huge
28:43
responsibility and nobody no anointed Pastor Minister deserves that
28:51
is worthy of that
This is a Big Responsibility
28:59
no Pastor or minister or person is worthy to have a church of even two
29:04
people three people four people five people this is a big responsibility a
29:10
big honor that God had done that given entrusted these people to me as their
29:17
Shepherd and he and I and he spoke to me value what I've given
29:23
you don't don't take this lightly this is serious
29:29
responsibility these are people's lives their their spiritual lives are at
29:35
stake and so you need to focus on them you need to look at them as the most
29:40
important people in the world you know like love them with your whole
29:47
heart and so when I would prepare my messages I didn't it was really difficult for me to prepare messages
29:53
because public speaking was my biggest fear and weakness and pre preaching I never knew how to do it was very
29:59
uncomfortable uncomfortable for me always to preach but God convicted me to have this
30:05
servant heart and to renew my mind whenever I'm preparing the messages and when I would speak the message to give
30:12
my all to love the people through this
30:17
service of teaching to love God and love his people with all of my heart and to
30:24
to preach with Excellence with passion with boldness and
30:31
confidence when there was just five people and tons of empty chairs and a huge empty gym staring at me in the face
30:39
God convicted me of this have a servant heart Catherine have a servant heart and serve
30:46
my people focus on that alone don't think about anything else don't think
30:52
about how you feel how you don't want to be doing this how this is uncomfortable for you don't think about the the fact
30:57
that it it's been years and you haven't seen growth don't think about any of that
31:03
think about serving my people that's [Applause]
How the Revival Broke Out
31:12
it and so week after week twice a week for four and a half years that was my
31:19
life just showing up with this servant heart and giving my all and trying my
31:24
best just to to love people and serve them well and and and Steward
31:31
well what God had given me this prophetic word came from my spiritual father Prophet Dr Jord Davy
31:38
that the way this revival was going to break out and people were going to start coming was going to be through one
31:45
minute videos that came to pass surely amen that prophecy came to pass that's
31:52
literally how the Revival broke out was through a 59c video and then it kept increasing through these one minute
31:58
videos on online showing God moving in power testimonies power of God moving
32:04
through the screen and touching people that's how the Revival broke out
32:11
Hallelujah but but I I received this prophetic word from my spiritual father
The Prophetic Word
32:18
and I knew it was a word from God and and and and he said you have to put these videos out
32:24
and keep put putting them out like keep going no matter what it looks like like the like going around the walls of
32:29
Jericho just keep going and so I valued what God had given me that precious word
32:36
of Direction it wasn't like I'm guessing let me try this this isn't working let me try over here no this was precious
32:43
accurate absolute direction from God of how to reach the promised land
32:50
and so I valued that and I said well I don't have anybody we don't really have
32:55
a team it was pretty much me doing 99% of 90 95% of all the ministry
33:02
work we don't have an editor but I'm I I I did I played around
33:08
an iMovie one time and I knew God gave me a
33:13
brain Moses was given a staff and God said what's in your hand
33:19
use it God's giving me a brain I got to use it I can teach myself I'm able to learn
33:27
to go Google how do I you edit use iMovie so I did that and I started
33:35
editing and editing editing editing like sometimes 10 hours 13 hours a day I just
33:42
edited so much because I value this prophetic word I put my focus on the editing on the posting and on uh the the
33:50
preparing of the messages and preaching that's that was my life for about three years that's all I did no social life
33:57
at all that was my life every day I took it seriously what God had
34:04
given me amen and so I kept I put those videos
34:10
out all the time and it was about two and a half I think it was like
34:15
two and a half years I'm not seeing any physical fruit hardly any views but I
34:20
just kept going until on my 30th birthday January 1st
34:25
2021 this one video I put out reached one million views and God's power moved
34:31
through the video and there was thousands of people testimon testifying of Miracles they received while watching and that's that was the beginning of the
34:37
Revival breaking out
The Mighty Work
34:43
Hallelujah but but what if I Reed that prophetic word and I was like uh I don't
34:49
really feel like teaching myself how to edit or what if after two years of doing
34:54
that not seeing any growth of the video views or anything what if I just decided
35:00
uh I don't know I don't know if that prophetic word really is going to work and I
35:08
stopped the it God wouldn't have entrusted me with more that video wouldn't have been out
35:15
there to go viral and Reach people and touch people with God's
35:20
power so this is what um my test looked like with serving with a servant
35:30
heart and God is asking you to serve him with a servant
35:36
heart to to to be to be Servants of his kingdom in his work to his work like his
35:44
work the the the work of God the ministry the ministry that goes forth in the church like here at fivefold
35:51
church this is this is the the the mighty work
35:57
this is I mean like the The Works that take place at the church that's
36:04
the the like biggest part of the work of God just like with Peter coming and all
36:09
were healed they would come under Peter's Shadow and all were healed this is where the place where you receive
36:17
from this is the place where you receive impartation where you receive equipping so you I don't care who you
36:25
are no believer can just depart from the church and serving in the church and
36:31
serve God their own way and expect God to entrust them with
36:38
anointing you cannot depart from the church you cannot depart serving neglect
36:43
serving this is where God tests you if you will serve him in his
36:50
house serve his ministries and this looks like all sorts
36:57
of things this looks like mundane things like for me even even though it was my
37:02
Ministry even though I was a leader of the ministry but what I did applies to all of you the
37:07
editing the doing the mundane work mindless work sometimes the
37:13
behindth scenes stuff I remember um there was just a handful of us it was
37:18
myself and Johan tall and a handful of us that would that would load up our entire
37:25
church equipment that was in my tiny two-bedroom apartment kitchen I didn't
37:31
have a kitchen for four something year four and a half
37:37
years I didn't have a kitchen it was the storage it was the church storage
37:44
place and it was literally like like basically this but like like
37:51
this whole area pretty much was speakers and chairs and stands and uh we had
38:01
drums yeah the whole that drum drum set that drum set was in my
38:08
kitchen yeah and these speakers were in my
38:16
kitchen and this Podium was in my kitchen am I speaking the TRU Shantal
38:22
yeah and we got rid of these things but there's like a rig thing like kind of like a stand like this but like tons of
38:29
them and we like had this makeshift like curtain thing cuz it was in a gym to make it look better it was a lot of
38:35
stuff and it took like three or four people four of us it took us like three
38:41
probably four hours every Friday and Sunday to load everything from my
38:47
apartment bring it down the elevator into my car and another person's car and set it all up and tear it all down and
38:53
put it back in my car and back in my apartment and someone else is
38:59
car that's what we were that's what Johan T and I were doing 4 hours a week just doing that
39:06
stuff and so servant heart servant heart God's looking for you to do this these
39:12
kinds of things the there's so many things that go into the work of God to go forth there's so many different
39:19
aspects and they're very important so many different things un so many unseen behind in's things that are
39:27
vital for the work of God to go forth and with
39:32
excellence and so you here all of you here who are coming to fivefold church
39:38
you should be serving if you're here in person you can see jeanal at the end you
39:44
and if she's if she's busy talking to someone or something you can come to those the the people on the serving team
39:50
I brought up in the beginning ask them how can I serve there's there's we need
39:55
more servant in the house of God so we can go forth with Excellence more
40:02
amen hallelujah
40:08
um there's been so many more videos that have now been able to come out and be
God is Looking
40:14
posted and and even the the whole launching of the podcast that's all
40:19
happened because there have been people who stepped up to the plate to serve God
40:25
to take time out of their own lives and serve God in his house in his
40:30
work amen and so God is looking at this
40:35
if you are serious about serving him in his work not serving your own Ministry
40:42
not serving with weird other motives or agendas not serving so you could be seen
40:50
or noticed but serving with a pure servant heart he's looking for this he's
40:56
looking to see if you're behind the scenes no one else is seen but God that you are serving him alone you're serving
41:03
his people and you don't care who sees God's looking for this this is a test
41:09
he's he's taking you through and seeing if you will pass
41:16
[Applause]
God Will Take You Through
41:24
amen so the next test the next stewardship
41:30
test is that God will take you through is a test of your
41:36
faith a test of your faith if you will be spiritual a test of your spiritual
41:43
eyesight and spiritual maturity because because to carry the anointing is a
41:48
spiritual thing you cannot be carnal and carry the anointing you can be you'll be carnal
41:55
and you'll be hearing Le from the devil and misusing the anointing you have to be
42:02
spiritual and everything is based on faith our relationship with God is based on faith uh ministering to God's people
42:09
is based on faith being used in the anointing it is all based on faith so you have to be a person of faith of
42:17
powerful strong faith for God to entrust you with more
42:24
anointing one of the ways that he is looking at your faith is he's seeing if you are valuing what he has spoken he's
42:31
seeing if you are valuing his
42:36
[Music] promises I knew that God had really spoken to me through this true Prophet
42:43
these promises I knew without a shadow of a doubt and I'm telling you that even after four and a half years of feeling
42:50
like going I was going backwards I never doubted I never doubted that these
42:57
promises would not come to pass not one day did I doubt I knew that God had
43:03
spoken and I knew that God was not a liar I was just
43:10
humbled I was just humbled to realize I don't know everything God
43:17
doesn't reveal everything to me God doesn't reveal the timing of everything what I when I thought things would
43:24
happen they didn't I was wrong God just humbled me is all that took place it was
43:30
never a doubting so every time that I was like disappointed like oh
43:37
2018s passed and God's promises haven't come to pass yet 2019 pass God's prom
43:43
hasn't come to pass yet it was never doubting it was never a moment of I
43:49
don't know maybe maybe this won't happen even when I did not feel for for for so
43:55
many of those years for about honestly like pretty much all of those years
44:00
before before the Revival broke out I felt uncomfortable
44:05
preaching I didn't feel like a good preacher I felt like every other
44:12
preacher was better than me I felt like I wasn't powerful even
44:18
three years into preaching every Sunday I did not and and Friday many times I did not feel like I was an apostle
44:28
but I believe God's promises I believe the word he spoke I've called you to be an apostle of the Nations I believe that
44:35
word over my feelings over my lack of confidence feelings inside I believe God's
44:43
word I valued God's spoken prophetic words so much and his promises that I
44:48
wrote down as as it says in the word of God it says that we in habac it says we should write down the
44:54
vision write it down down this is part of valuing what God has spoken so I
45:00
wrote down these prophecies I put them on my wall and I would look at them and
45:06
I would renew my mind I wouldn't let myself forget what God had spoken and
45:11
how much I knew it was truth what he had spoken it wasn't some dream it wasn't
45:18
some random prophecy that maybe's not accurate God had spoken it I kept reminding myself God had
45:25
spoken Spen this it must come to
45:31
pass and so God Is Watching if you will value his promises if you are complaining you are
45:38
not valuing his promises if you are saying things like I don't know if this will really happen
45:44
after all I mean you are not valuing his promises if you are complaining that
45:51
things are taking too long you're not valuing his promises he never promised that you
45:57
would get a shortcut he never promised that the road would be easy to the promised land he promised the promised
46:05
land you would [Applause]
Honor Your Spiritual Father
46:13
enter and so I I took it seriously these words I remember even to my spiritual
46:19
father I would um you know be reverent and and like honoring I wouldn't I I had
46:26
access to him I could talk to him as much as I wanted to but I I I I made
46:34
sure I was mature spiritually I I didn't whine and ask him like so like what did
46:41
you mean with this prophetic word like so how much longer do you
46:48
think you know like are we going to get smaller again this
46:54
year this is really hard but I'm just trying I'm trying but it's really hard but I'm
47:02
trying God is good but it's hard sometimes like like fishing for
47:09
Comfort fishing for prophetic word give me another prophetic word for Comfort no
47:16
you know like I I know God's always
47:21
watching he's watching everything and I want to make him proud
47:26
I want to please him always I don't want to
47:32
dishonor this his servant my spiritual father I I I don't want to misuse that
47:41
relationship you know and unnecessarily ask things because I'm being uh selfish
47:47
and spiritually immature no I took it seriously what God had entrusted me with
47:54
I I valued that he had given me a spiritual father that was this incredible prophet
48:02
of God I valued that and so I treated him with honor and respect and that was
48:09
valuing God by by honoring and respecting my spiritual
48:14
father and growing up and not being a baby but toughening up being standing
48:22
strong in the spirit I'm just going to keep going not going to let my feelings take
48:29
over I'm going to be strong in the spiritual realm I'm going to have a strong
48:37
faith so in those moments where I'd get on that stage on a Friday worship night and see nobody in the congregation or
48:43
one person and I would literally hold back tears I didn't look forward to a venting
48:49
session with Jean tall afterwards but I know I renewed my mind remember the promises
48:56
and this is all about serving God he's watching you're doing it all for an audience of one so it doesn't matter
49:01
who's here remember the promises be strong Catherine be
49:07
strong God is faithful be strong I would tell myself
49:12
that
49:19
Amen to be an anointed vessel of God you got to have strong faith you got to be
49:25
spirit you got to be strong in the spirit because the devil is highly spiritual he's a
49:31
spirit so if you are not strong in the spirit you'll be defeated by the devil and the more anointing you carry the
49:38
more the devil wants to take you down and the way you win is by being spiritual by being strong in
49:51
faith so that's why God cannot give you more anointing when you're not growing
49:56
up when you're being a baby grow up you have the ability to there's so many times in the word it
50:03
says be strong and courageous be
50:09
strong don't whine and cry and ask God for strength he's given it to you already be strong you be
50:18
[Applause] strong you grow up you renew your mind
50:27
you value what God has spoken and apply what he's spoken to
50:35
you [Applause]
The Test of Your Tongue
50:44
Hallelujah you don't receive the anointing by being wimpy and
50:49
childish God has given you some of you don't realize what God's given you if you would just if you would just
50:57
uh believe I mean his spirit in
51:02
you you could be bold like a lion you could be so strong but you've never tried you never tried to Roar you never
51:11
tried to stand up and do something hard that your feelings didn't want you to
51:16
do try it test God see the power that's
51:22
in you the power of the Holy Spirit that's in
51:30
you Hallelujah the next test that God will
51:37
take you through is the test of your
51:44
tongue the test of your tongue Proverbs 18:21 your words are so powerful that
51:52
they will kill or give life this is a passion
51:57
translation and the talkative person will reap the consequences meaning the person who talks carelessly will reap
52:05
the consequences this is true your words this is the biggest
52:11
weapon for good or bad that every human on this Earth has when you um are just in the world
52:19
and you don't have Jesus when a person doesn't have Jesus they still their words carry power some
52:25
of you have been freed of curses or will be freed of curses that someone without Jesus and not even accessing demonic
52:33
Powers but they cursed you with words of death they spoke over you so people in
52:38
the world though they're not accessing witchcraft Powers their words can carry so Much Death power of death and bring
52:46
bondage God can you devil can use them even if they're not going and accessing demonic Powers devil can use them and
52:53
devil can use Christians too to do the same exact thing but the thing
52:58
is that when you receive the anointing this is power now you've received so the tongue is powerful
53:05
without the power of God the tongue with the power of God is
53:11
much more [Applause]
53:17
powerful but for good or bad you still have free will and so this is one of the reasons
53:23
why God has to start out small with the anointing he releases to you because you could literally kill
53:30
what's been put inside of you you could kill your own spiritual life by the words you speak you could cause harm to
53:35
other people with the words you speak so God has to make sure that you
53:41
your tongue is tamed and that you are spiritual in this way that you really have revelation of
53:48
this spiritual truth of the power of life and death in your tongue and that you take it so seriously I I remember
53:55
when I first grabbed grabbed hold of this revelation of the power of my tongue I became so silent for a
54:02
Time the talkative person will rap the consequences it's true I don't want to
54:07
talk carelessly anymore I don't want to just jabber I don't want to um you know gossip and not even realize I'm
54:14
gossiping but end up gossiping and I'm speaking death I became quiet and I I from that
54:20
day I changed overnight every word I speak it must be in intentional it must
54:26
be life it must come with
54:31
purpose even even in Social gatherings I used to be really really really really
54:37
talkative but then something switched then when I had this Revelation where I
54:43
was like I don't want to just talk just to talk I don't want to just talk to like feel
54:49
seen and feel important but I want to bring life to a
54:54
this person I want to bring purpose it's better that I be
55:00
quiet if not so let me encourage this person let
55:05
me compliment this person um let me speak life let me share my testimony
55:11
about Jesus only right Hallelujah
55:19
so um I remember that I never really I
The Power of Your Words
55:25
never complained about the the journey taking so long and and
55:32
and and the church getting smaller and smaller and smaller and it being hard and uncomfortable to go and preach every
55:38
week I never complained because I had this revelation of the power of my words
55:45
and the truth is is that if I'm complaining if I'm speaking this is so hard I don't like to do
55:52
this it literally is an Open Door for the enemy to send even more lies of
55:59
you're not good enough look people aren't coming back and the church is getting smaller you're not powerful
56:06
you're not a good preacher this is hard whatever what that's what happens
56:13
when you speak these things like this is really hard and I don't think I'm good
56:19
at this if God has called you to do this or whatever when you're speaking things like this that you think are casual
56:25
the devil hears and he's like oo I found a weak
56:30
spot okay cool I'm going to send more ammunition here I got strategy here in this
56:40
area and so though the enemy would try for those years speaking lies to me it
56:46
wasn't as bad as it would have been it wasn't paralyzing it was a voice in my head you
56:51
know saying you're not very good you know know but it didn't it it wasn't a
56:58
stronghold it was those it was those normals weapon formed against us that do not
57:04
Prosper so I I would hear them but I would renew my mind and I would preach
57:09
and I would preach with confidence not feeling confident but the but I would
57:16
spiritually step up and speak I believe that God has given me this word I believe that what I'm speaking is
57:22
Anointed I believe that change will come in these people's lives I don't feel like it but I believe and I believe
57:27
there's power in my words so so so all that time no one knew I asked John tall
57:34
she never I would she would encourage me after many times and I'd be like really it was powerful wow Hallelujah I didn't
57:42
feel that way praise God you know but people wouldn't even see what I was feeling inside but if I had spoken death
57:52
if I had agreed with those Devils lies then I would have become paralyzed I wouldn't have the strength
57:59
it would be a stronghold rather than a weapon formed against me that I can reject it would become a stronghold that
58:05
would hold me back amen and and I took this seriously this
58:12
prophetic word these these prophetic words these promises and I wanted to do everything I could to to uh make the
58:21
promise come alive I don't want to hold back the promise I wanted to speak life to that
58:29
promise so you know whenever it was getting smaller and it
58:35
was having a discouraging moment I would speak God's promises will come to pass
58:42
this is just the refining fire of the Wilderness time God is strengthening me
58:47
through this but God will make the promises come to
58:53
pass [Applause]
58:59
and I would I would value the promises and I would also speak life for the promises I would I would thank God in
59:05
advance for all of you who are here today when there was just five people and there weren't really many miracles
59:11
taking place I believed God's word that many people would be here in this church
59:17
and be receiving deliverance and healing and miracles from Jesus and so I I spoke
59:23
these things and I thanked God for these things I thank God for you instead of
59:28
complaining I would choose to speak life thank you Lord for the many people you
59:33
will bring to fivefold church in your timing and that thank you that they will be receiving healing and freedom and
59:41
miracles from you thank you Jesus I would thank God in
59:46
advance Speak Life to the promise Hallelujah so you have a part to and
59:54
seen this promise come to pass you can delay it you can be stagnant or you can
1:00:00
push it along and make make it you to reach it in God's perfect timing by
1:00:06
speaking life only you need to be speaking life over yourself and other people
1:00:13
only when you carry this anointing it's real
1:00:19
power and so you need to know how to use it you need to know you need to know how to speak you need to be you walk in this
1:00:26
Revelation I carry anointing the power of God I must release it exactly how God
1:00:31
wants I must not withhold anything I must give to the people I must give life
1:00:38
I must give these words of life so you have to get that in your mind before the
1:00:44
more of the anointing comes and it starts with your own personal life and your family those
1:00:50
around you you're speaking words of death over your life you're you're agreeing with
1:00:56
lies of the devil instead of rejecting them and you think God's going to entrust you with more
1:01:03
anointing because you're first given authority over your own spiritual life before God gives you authority over
1:01:09
other people's spiritual lives so you have to master the authority over your own personal life
1:01:16
you'd have to be walking in Victory constantly over the devil in your own spiritual life every lie of the devil's
1:01:21
coming you're catching you're rejecting every weapon formed against you you're rejected not one of them prospers this
1:01:28
is possible if you will make the [Applause]
1:01:34
intention and as you make this intention as you take this seriously the power of your words uh words of death are no
1:01:41
longer in part of your vocabulary when a person swears often they're not even thinking about it it's
1:01:47
just coming out of their mouth it's part of the vocabulary but me I was raised by amazing parents that would not even let
1:01:53
me say oh my gosh because it sounded too closely to oh my God true story so I said oh my
1:02:02
word yes I was made fun of too um I said oh my word that's all I
1:02:08
said and so but I love Mom and Dad for specifically mom for being strict in
1:02:14
that area because you know what curse words literally have never been a part of my vocabulary a day in my life
1:02:21
[Applause] Hallelujah but it's true it's like if you've never used the word it's like
1:02:27
it's a different language it's almost like it's literally a different language like French or German it's a different
1:02:33
language you know that's how it is if you never speak curse words it it you
1:02:39
don't even know how to say it so that's how it becomes in your life when you
1:02:45
train your mind when you become spiritually disciplined make intention to only speak
1:02:51
life you don't know how to agree with the devil's lies it's not part of your
1:02:59
vocabulary you don't know how to speak a word of death it's not part of your vocabulary amen and so this is this
1:03:08
testing this is this testing God's taking you on now be serious about this God's looking at your mouth your
1:03:15
tongue he will release you with release more to you when you've T tamed your
1:03:20
tongue and when you only Speak Life Hallelujah
1:03:26
um the the next test is a test of the
1:03:32
next next test of stewardship is a test of
1:03:37
boldness and fear of God over man and a heart for
1:03:45
others it is a test a test to see if you will release
1:03:53
what you have received already the Miracles you have received in your own
1:04:00
life and if you will do this it means that you need boldness it means you need
1:04:06
to fear God over man and it means you need to have a heart for
1:04:13
others so uh Revelation 19:10 says the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
1:04:20
Prophecy when you testify of what Jesus has done for you of Deliverance he's
1:04:26
brought you healing he's brought you a miracle he's brought for you a spirit comes forth from your mouth or from your
1:04:35
video that you are proud for it to be seen of the miracle happening a spirit
1:04:40
comes forth through your mouth through the video of [Music]
1:04:49
Prophecy this is this is what happens this is what happens
1:04:56
is there stairs only here yeah
1:05:02
so God delivered me from
1:05:08
anxiety and there's 10 people here who had anxiety all of a sudden something in
1:05:15
the spirit was dropped into your spirit into your spirit into your spirit into your spirit into your
1:05:20
[Applause] spirit prophecy has come prophesying you will
1:05:27
be delivered of anxiety now you will be delivered of anxiety now you will be delivered of anxiety
1:05:35
now in the spiritual realm in the spiritual realm there are two things that are needed to release
1:05:42
the Miracles only two things the power of God and
1:05:50
faith and before even any of you carry the the power of God you can you can be
1:05:57
50% apart of someone receiving a miracle by releasing Faith to
1:06:08
others it's not the minister with the anointing that's responsible for all the Miracles taking
1:06:15
place and it's not just God's responsibility for all the Miracles taking place it's your responsibility to share
1:06:23
your testimony so that others can receive
1:06:29
[Applause] faith when you're free of something when you're healed of something when a
1:06:34
miracle happens truly when you share about it when you testify about it when you are happy for your video to be shown
1:06:43
of that happening to you that testimony going forth in that way seriously in the spiritual realm many people especially
1:06:50
at fold church with reaching millions of people many have literally received more
1:06:56
faith because of you directly because of what you have released in the spiritual
1:07:01
realm they have received Faith necessary to receive the miracle now what that they didn't have
1:07:09
before and a preacher with with powerful anointing and God's with them and God is
1:07:14
here to do all the Miracles but and the powerful preacher is preaching have
1:07:19
faith God's real believe and you will receive miracles
1:07:25
and not a single Miracle could happen if there's no faith Jesus couldn't do hardly any
1:07:30
miracles in his hometown because there was no faith this is how important faith is to receiving
1:07:39
Miracles and the biggest way faith is received to others the faith is released
1:07:46
to others and received by others is by the testimony
1:07:52
shared so this this is s this is this is honest
1:07:58
truth let's say one person here shares their testimony and we put on a video to
1:08:03
the worlds of millions of people who are seeing it
1:08:10
probably 1% of the people watching may receive a
1:08:16
miracle but if 100% of all of you share your
1:08:21
testimony and this testimony is released to all the people probably 100% could
1:08:28
receive
1:08:34
Miracles because the more testimonies that are released it's more prophecy it's more in the spiritual real Faith
1:08:40
dropping in people's Spirits it's more and so that's why our
1:08:46
testimony is so important we cannot withhold it this is a disgrace to God this is
1:08:53
rude to God this is irresponsible with what he's given entr trusted you with
1:08:58
it's not yours it's God's it belongs to Gods it's his
1:09:06
glory the miracle he's done in your life is for God's glory it's not yours to
1:09:12
hang on to it's not yours to say I don't want to share it it's not yours to say take a video down of my testimony or
1:09:19
video of a miracle God's doing it belongs to God it's it's for his
1:09:25
[Applause] glory and I take this very seriously
1:09:32
here at fivefold church I know the spiritual truth I know that every testimony is connected to many more
1:09:39
people receiving Miracles because of one testimony I remember when the first uh
1:09:46
person was delivered of autism child was delivered of autism all
1:09:51
of a sudden it was like every week people were bringing their children with autism and then their children were
1:09:57
getting free too and testimonies just kept increasing but that all happened because
1:10:03
one person decided to come and share their testimony that wouldn't have taken place if that one didn't share their
1:10:10
[Applause] testimony and so you know we have this
1:10:16
policy at fivefold church it's known we have cameras if you don't want to be seen
1:10:23
stand in the back back put a mask on your head watch online no
1:10:30
seriously if I call you up and you don't want to come you don't have to come I'll still pray for
1:10:35
you you know I'm not I'm not forcing anybody on the stage I'm not forcing
1:10:40
anyone to be on the camera if you really don't want to be on the camera go in the back or go outside or put a
1:10:46
mask I'm not forcing anyone amen amen it's no forcing and it's really annoying
1:10:53
own thing I think everyone should probably know by now that it's filmed here you will be filmed here there are
1:10:59
cameras here it's no secret amen that's how you all have come here because of
1:11:06
videos [Applause]
1:11:11
Hallelujah and so we have this policy you know if if you have you know been
1:11:18
willing to come here and be seen and be recorded you can't come back later and
1:11:23
say I don't want my video anymore because your testimony is tied
1:11:29
to so many people receiving Miracles and God has chosen to do this
1:11:37
miracle for you not just for you it's but for many
1:11:42
people it was intentional and purposeful why your miracle was recorded or why you
1:11:48
recorded your testimony it's because God LED you there it's because God that's part of the reason why certain
1:11:53
one-on-one Miracles take place it's not that oh God can only move through the one-on-one prayer for this person
1:11:59
because the demons are extra strong in this person no God's anointing is so much more powerful than
1:12:05
that it doesn't have to do with that at all but some people that receive
1:12:11
oneon-one prayer lots of times it's God's plan he knows this specific miracle and testimony is going to be
1:12:18
connected to many people receiving Miracles and testimonies
1:12:25
amen amen there's been um a video that
1:12:30
went viral recently of a beautiful miracle that took place and what a Revival is now event
1:12:36
and this video has like almost three million views on
1:12:41
different platforms combined and I don't I didn't do the
1:12:46
math this is just off the cuff I'm thinking of this I didn't do the math but I don't know I think that there's
1:12:52
probably at least like 30 to 40,000 new followers that
1:13:01
have been now receiving from Jesus through this ministry because of that
1:13:08
video going
1:13:14
viral and the Spanish Community Spanish speaking Community there's been on our
1:13:21
we we have a now we have an official uh Spanish page Apostle cath CRI and
1:13:27
espanol and it grew and it was this viral video and
1:13:34
another video went viral of just God moving in power at fivefold church through different people and other places of Revival now events and there's
1:13:41
like 30 something thousand followers that I think just came in just a couple weeks or
1:13:46
something we we've had about 200 people on the zoom call Z the Spanish
1:13:52
translation the past couple weeks when we had 15 before every other week
1:14:01
Hallelujah but what this came from testimonies being
1:14:09
seen being heard and so whether whether it's the
1:14:15
testimony of the miracle taking place like the demon going out from you and it being seen the miracle whether it's that
1:14:21
testimony or the verbal testimony of you sharing about what God did in that
1:14:26
experience in your life before and after it is your responsibility to
1:14:32
Steward it well and not keep it to yourself and share it this Parable we
1:14:37
read about in the beginning about one who hid they hid the
1:14:43
testimony God was so mad and cast out the person I mean I mean the master was so
1:14:50
mad in that Parable that he he he hid the money the the the money that was given he was mad
1:14:56
and it was taken from him that's the same principle with your testimony God wants you to share and
1:15:03
share in every way possible and that's like yielding a Greater Harvest and God will then entrust you with
1:15:09
more you cannot be ashamed of what God has done for you you must be bold you
1:15:16
must not have the fear of man but have the fear of God only and you must have a heart for God's
1:15:22
people your testimony is about giving God glory
1:15:28
and loving other people so that they can receive miracles from Jesus have this heart and share your
1:15:35
testimony in as as as as much as you can you know through every platform you can
1:15:40
record it email your testimony to info@ 5f church.org allow it to be seen to the
1:15:48
masses that's how you can Steward it well amen
1:15:54
hallelujah praise God praise God thank you Jesus thank you
1:16:03
Jesus so today was a teaching to give you Insight of these tests that God has
1:16:09
been taking you through already maybe you didn't realize and that God will be taking you through and seeing that you
1:16:16
pass them before releasing more so now is not the time to sit and wait for the
1:16:23
promised land now is not the time to sit and complain why are things taking long now is the time to get serious it's
1:16:30
testing time it's time to time for training yourself in the spiritual realm being disciplined Renewing Your Mind God
1:16:37
Is Watching Me I want to please him I want to be a good Steward I want him to
1:16:42
be able to entrust me with more cuz that's what he wants to entrust you with more amen
1:16:50
hallelujah
