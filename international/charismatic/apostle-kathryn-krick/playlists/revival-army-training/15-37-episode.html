today I'm going to teach a message called the global gospel Philippians 3
0:06
verse 20. we are citizens of Heaven
0:14
where the Lord Jesus Christ lives your this is your part of your true
0:21
identity like where you live where you're from your citizenship is you are
0:26
a citizen of Heaven that's your real home
0:32
that's your real nationality that that's the real home that you have
0:39
and so you shouldn't be thinking immediately you know I'm American I'm Canadian
0:45
I'm British French you should be thinking I am a
0:53
citizen of Heaven because those things yes they're true but once
1:00
you go to heaven those things don't matter it does not matter the real you is a
1:07
citizen of Heaven and so you know there's so many different cultures in
1:14
this world we have so many different languages so many different ways of life we look so different we sound different
1:22
we have different ways of living and so many times we can feel kind of separated we can feel
1:28
um like people in my country I belong here these are my people those
1:35
are foreigners those are strangers we can kind of feel that way but the reality is is that when you belong to
1:42
God when you're a child of God your real family is the body of Christ
1:49
across the whole world you are
1:55
you you you are closer in relationship to them than your physical neighbor
2:02
in this earth in your country in your city that's the reality
2:08
that's powerful so that means all these different nations that are here
2:14
we are just as close in the spirit as our blood relatives
2:22
even closer sometimes [Applause] just as close
2:27
Hallelujah praise God
2:35
so this is your real identity this is your true culture the kingdom culture
2:42
that you are a citizen of Heaven our real culture that's our true culture
2:47
is the kingdom of God culture meaning God's way of doing things the
2:53
kingdom way God's kingdom principles how we live our lives according to how
2:59
God wants us to that's our real culture the kingdom of God culture
3:10
now a lot of the aspects of culture of different cultures in society they
3:16
come from from humans creativity
3:22
like each country and even within the country there are different cultures right different ways of doing things
3:28
different ways of living different ways of dressing just different ways of of living
3:34
of expressing yourself that's culture um but much of it comes from Human
3:41
creativity we are made in the image of God and he's given us a mind
3:48
and we create like the Creator right
3:54
but what's important to understand is that the culture that you're a part of
3:59
it's come from creativity of men and women
4:05
it has not come straight from God in most cases
4:11
when we're talking about culture there's good and bad
4:18
just like any kind of creativity there can be good creativity and bad creativity good creativity to write songs that
4:25
glorify God that bring light for example movies good movies good inspirational
4:31
movies that glorify God there can be bad creativity that that glorifies the devil that
4:38
brings darkness in the music in the movies right
4:45
so um what's important to understand is that culture different kinds of
4:53
cultures from different countries like all the different cultures that we
4:58
have they are not bad they just are not Supreme
5:06
they can be good they can be beautiful because we're made in God's image and some creativity is good
5:12
beautiful but it's not Supreme like there's no culture on this earth
5:20
that is supreme
5:27
Hallelujah
5:34
so I'm going to go through a couple examples about um
5:39
how we see different kinds of cultures in different expressions of different
5:46
different aspects of culture now it says in First Corinthians 6 verse
5:51
19 don't you realize that your body is the Temple of the Holy Spirit who lives in you and who was given to you by God
5:57
you do not belong to yourself for God brought bought you with a high price so
6:02
you must honor God with your body you must honor God with your body
6:08
so that's Kingdom culture that's Supreme culture that we honor God how we dress
6:15
we honor God with how we dress right but when you look at different cultures
6:22
different countries and different cultures within a country in the church let's look in the church
6:29
right now we're looking in the church different cultures people have different interpretations of
6:34
that scripture and most of them are not wrong that scripture means honor God with your
6:42
body with how you dress that um you know it would be modest it wouldn't be distracting
6:49
and it would represent God well God is royal
6:54
so you should look Royal I mean not that you have to have something expensive in gold or something
7:00
but put together not smelly
7:05
rags but Royal put together doesn't matter the cost
7:13
but looking presentable and nice because you want to represent God well
7:19
you want to to to he's beautiful so you want to be beautiful on the
7:25
outside too in terms of like presenting yourself with how you dress amen
7:31
and so um there's not a certain dress that's the right way in God's eyes
7:38
to honor him the best there's not a certain kind of dress for men and women that I can tell you right now it's going
7:43
to be different so for all these different cultures in the church we see people dressing
7:49
differently in America in Western culture and
7:54
American culture in the church for the most part because America has a bunch of different cultures we'll say like the
8:00
the majority in American church is this is how we dress how how people dress for
8:08
the most part casual but put together
8:14
usually not really fancy that's not wrong that's not right that's
8:22
just that's fine that's good that's just American culture
8:27
other cultures they they see honoring God how they dress
8:33
is the very Sunday best the absolute best fanciest outfit suits
8:41
dresses hair all done that's how they see honoring God with
8:47
their bodies with dress it's it's not like it's wrong or right
8:53
it's right for them that's culture
8:59
Hallelujah
9:04
and um and then in different other cultures some could see like tight clothing not
9:12
like skin tight but like tighter clothing is not seen as sexual on women for example in churches
9:20
it's not seen as sexual and it's honoring it's seen as honoring to God and that's not wrong that's their
9:27
culture other cultures think you know you can't even show the knee
9:34
and it must be completely baggy everything and that's honoring
9:39
it's different cultures amen now of course there can be some bad in there
9:45
squeezing in but I'm talking in the most part all these different types of cultures with dress in different
9:50
countries within countries it's not like it's wrong or right it's just culture
9:55
there's not one that's better than the other there's not one that's more right than the other
10:01
Hallelujah Kingdom culture is honoring God with how
10:08
the Holy Spirit leads you with your creativity because you're made in the image of God so that means it's
10:14
going to look different everywhere all around this world because he made us all different
10:20
Hallelujah and and now we're going to look at music
10:26
in the church in a bunch of different cultures different countries
10:32
there's different kinds of worship music there's contemporary music worship music
10:37
there's gospel there's all sorts of different there's
10:43
hymns but there's not one that's the best worship music
10:49
God doesn't say that's my favorite
10:55
but according to charts according to the charts
11:01
you can mistakenly think that one kind of music is the best
11:07
its culture of the world not Kingdom culture
11:15
language there's so many different languages
11:20
you can mistakenly think that because English is kind of like the biggest language that is the best it's not the
11:26
best there's no language that's the best or better than the other
11:32
we're talking Kingdom culture here we're talking citizen of Heaven talk here we're learning how to be citizens of
11:38
heaven today amen all languages are equally beautiful in
11:43
God's eyes period on music
11:50
all dressed in the church it's all beautiful Hallelujah
11:57
Galatians 3 verse 26 this is a passion translation you have all become true children of God
12:04
by faith in Jesus the anointed one it was faith that immersed you into Jesus
12:09
the anointed one and now you are covered and clothed with his anointing and we no
12:15
longer see each other in our former state Jew or non-jew
12:23
rich or poor male or female because
12:29
we're all one through our Union with Jesus Christ with no distinction between
12:38
us
12:45
and it's specifically I want to show this specifically we learned about there's no male or female last week
12:51
but look there's no there's no Jew or non-jew there's no Jew or Gentile
12:58
there's no American or Austrian there's no Australian or German
13:06
there's none There's no distinction in the spirit we are all equal
13:14
we are all equally beautiful every skin tone is equally beautiful
13:23
[Applause] every hair color and hair texture is
13:29
equally beautiful every tone of the voice low or high is
13:37
equally beautiful every height short or tall is equally
13:42
beautiful every body type curvy thin is equally
13:48
beautiful [Applause]
13:56
you're all equally beautiful we're all equally beautiful There's no distinction
14:03
zero this is so different from World
14:10
citizenship this is a real spiritual teaching today
14:18
like your spiritual eyes are opening up in a new level today because this is so different from the
14:24
world's way from society's way the truth is that the devil has come in
14:30
in a scheme a long time ago and he has spoken lies he has indeed spoken lies
14:37
all over the world in every country in every kind of um Avenue you can speak it
14:43
through music through movies through through politicians anybody leaders
14:49
celebrities he's spoken this that a certain uh nationality is the best
14:56
is supreme a certain skin color is supreme a certain body type is supreme a
15:02
certain hair type hair color eye color is supreme it's true the devil has spoken these
15:09
lies and he's spoken them hugely every generation
15:15
we cannot deny this truth that these lies are huge in our society
15:23
right this is the world this is what being a global citizen is like
15:30
is is is hearing these lies and being influenced by these lies
15:36
right and so what does this mean as citizens of Heaven it means that we have
15:43
to really do work to renew our mind in this area as for me even though society says that
15:51
my hair type isn't the best I'm equally beautiful as for me even
15:57
society says that my nationality isn't the best I am equally made equally beautiful
16:03
as for me even though society says my skin color isn't the best I am equally beautiful
16:11
I'm saying this for you you need to renew your mind this I am equally beautiful
16:17
the spiritual truth is supreme to the society's truth
16:24
we live in this world but not of this world and as we live
16:29
as we live as children of God in the kingdom of God this is more powerful
16:36
than any society structure and lie I mean we can overcome it
16:44
we can overcome it by the power of God the power of God is the greatest power in this whole world
16:50
you can overcome it you don't need to live like that in those lies so you for yourself you have to do this
16:57
work to renew your mind that you are a citizen of Heaven which means you were equal with everyone in this earth
17:03
equally beautiful and you can have equal the opportunities for God to use you for God to do whatever he wants through you
17:10
you are not limited I don't care what society says I don't
17:16
care what limits they put on you they're gone through Christ
17:23
Hallelujah and then secondarily
17:29
this message is I mean what I'm about to say is really true for so much speaking for Americans and
17:37
westerners we have really serious work to do in the
17:44
spiritual realm in terms of renewing our mind that others
17:49
are equally as important and beautiful as us
17:54
other nationalities other people with different cultures people with different languages people
18:00
with different skin tones they are equally as important and beautiful as us God favors them and
18:07
loves them just as much as us God wants to use them just as much as he wants to use us
18:14
there is no distinction between us
18:19
let me tell you this truth God wants to use every single person on this Earth he
18:27
wants to speak to them he wants to put his anointing in them and he wants to use them from every different Nation
18:33
just as powerfully and so the truth is is that a certain
18:41
nationality doesn't have a Grace to hear God's voice better than another
18:49
a certain nationality isn't more chosen by God to be leaders of in the body of
18:54
Christ than the other
19:00
I need to say that again a certain nation has not been chosen favored to be
19:07
used by God more than other nations as leaders in the body of Christ
19:13
[Applause] because I mean number one you need to
19:19
renew your mind that to see one another the same to see everyone is the same to see yourself as not lower but equal
19:27
but number two you need to understand that that this
19:34
this culture Global culture way society's way of saying a certain
19:40
Nations better than the other a certain culture is better than the other that has seeped into the church
19:50
it is seeped into the body of Christ I mean it's not surprising it's not surprising because this we live
19:57
in this world and a whole lot of Christians aren't spiritual for a lot of them it's not their fault
20:03
we've needed Revival we've needed anointed teaching
20:09
to teach people the ways of the devil the lies of the devil and how to reject
20:14
his lies and renew your mind and really be spiritual so it's not like it's a lot of people in
20:21
the church's fault in western church American church is fault no but the truth is is that they've been
20:28
told the wrong thing for a long time and that will have an effect
20:34
that will have an effect um um America is seen as like the Supreme Nation
20:42
I was shocked when I started traveling so much I've been to so many countries ministering
20:47
and I've I don't think I've like ever needed a Visa
20:53
beforehand the favor the unfair favor that we have
20:59
As Americans is crazy is wild I didn't even realize it like I
21:05
most in all of Europe Australia New Zealand you just show up and just show your passport
21:10
but that's only the case for Americans and maybe a couple other Western countries
21:16
that's just one example I give you but um I mean the movies the music it's
21:23
all coming from America mostly right that's the ones that have the platforms that reached the world the movies and
21:29
the music pop culture the world is mostly influenced by
21:36
America and then governmentally you know that's influence
21:43
primarily is America Okay so
21:48
it has been spoken to Americans whether they realize it or not that you're the best
21:57
you're better than others and um it's made a lot of and I want to just
22:05
talk about people in the church now it's made of a lot of um Christians in America be
22:11
arrogant because of ignorance
22:19
I'm not saying people are not humble but there's a lot of people who just because they don't know any better
22:25
because this is the only thing that's been told to them they're arrogant arrogant out of the ignorance
22:33
because they're not educated this is the devil's lies you're not better you're not a better
22:39
Nation you're not a better culture like every nation is equally beautiful when we think of Nations we need to think of
22:45
people in the Nations and so that's why I say every nation is
22:51
equally beautiful because they're all God's beautiful children
23:00
and God wants to speak to every child in every nation just the same
23:06
he doesn't have this favorite country that he gives more Revelations to
23:13
but it's steeped in the church so much and it's like it's it I mean just because of in society how America is and
23:20
how America has the Platforms in all these areas guess what that also means
23:25
they also are given these Platforms in the church in the body of Christ
23:31
probably most uh Body of Christ leaders that are known known worldwide are from
23:38
America probably I think so I didn't do account but I'm probably right right
23:45
but I have a news flash for you it doesn't mean that they're more
23:51
favored and special than others it doesn't mean that they're given
23:57
the best revelation it's Society
24:03
and God uses God wants to reach his people so he uses society's ways
24:10
you know it's not that he doesn't he does use he he will okay this is how this is how
24:17
Society is I will raise up people in America yes he does that he's doing that now amen
24:23
but it's so important for us to realize that we aren't like the best chosen
24:29
Christians the best chosen leaders in the body of Christ
24:35
it's just that we have the platform just because God's given someone a
24:40
platform or just because someone has a platform I mean just because someone has a platform does not necessarily mean
24:46
God's given them that platform yeah it's true
24:53
so Hallelujah so um
24:59
thank you Jesus so there's Revelations that God has given
25:07
to people who don't have a platform
25:13
Revelations are given to the humble amen
25:18
the Disciples of Jesus after casting out demons for the first time they were amazed that they could cast out demons
25:25
by God's Power and Jesus then says to the father I praise you father
25:31
for you have hidden these things from those who are who are wise in their own
25:38
eyes proud and you've only chosen to reveal it to those who become like children
25:46
I praise you father so this this is saying that God literally hides
25:52
Revelation revelation of the kingdom of God of spiritual principles of how to
25:57
cast out demons of how to access the anointing all sorts of things about the kingdom of God Mysteries secrets
26:03
he hides them from the proud and he only reveals them to the
26:09
childlike so
26:15
what happens when you have arrogance in leaders in the body of
26:20
Christ or people with Platforms in the church
26:27
Revelations will not be revealed right
26:32
and that people can be um arrogant out of ignorance
26:38
out of ignorance because this has been fed to them so much people can can really be that way they
26:45
can think because I am lifted I know best
26:51
there's nothing new for me to learn I'm the one to teach people can think that way and God will
26:56
never reveal the secrets the Mysteries Revelations to them
27:03
and God will reveal them to the humble and so there are Revelations
27:10
that God has revealed to the humble in other nations
27:17
that he has not revealed to those who are arrogant
27:22
leaders I remember when um I was a Christian my
27:28
whole life and when I first encountered God's power when I first saw the anointing move and
27:34
people be heagled and people be delivered and her teachings about the anointing and the fivefold ministry and
27:40
that prophets were around today that God is using them in apostles my spirit was leaping like this is truth
27:48
that I've yearned for this is the most truth spiritually in the spiritual realm that I've ever heard
27:55
my spirit was leaping that this was truth that this this meat spiritual teaching was truth
28:03
and it was coming from my spiritual father who's from Tanzania East Africa
28:10
and I remember at this moment I'm thinking wow how come how come I haven't heard this from
28:17
American teachers I couldn't figure it out for a while and
28:22
then God opened up my eyes renewed my mind with this truth
28:31
you know Christian leaders aren't Supreme just because they're from America
28:38
and the leaders and the teachers in America have to Humble themselves
28:43
and renew their minds you know they're not just put in that place because
28:49
they're so chosen by God sometimes it's just Society you're in the right place
28:56
so you have to humble yourself and not think that you know it all and be ready to learn something new be ready to learn
29:02
something new from a different country the truth is is that um
29:09
this this culture mentality of this certain country is supreme or this
29:15
certain race is supreme this has seeped into the church
29:21
there's true racism in some people yes for others it's not racism but
29:27
they are so influenced that they're just
29:35
um not meaning to think a certain way but they've just been trained a certain way by Society
29:40
that they do look at people differently not in a racist way not in a hateful way
29:47
but because they've been trained a certain way they just naturally look at
29:52
people differently look at people as maybe not as smart or
29:58
something just because of skin color and the country they're from
30:04
I know I've seen this a lot with my spiritual father I've seen that um
30:09
that wrong way of thinking and and people keep being capped from
30:15
receiving these precious Revelations from God because of that wrong thinking
30:21
so so this is why I say we need to be very intentional we we need to be real
30:26
with ourselves this is the world we live in this is just how it is whether we like it or not we've been taught the
30:33
wrong things the devil's lives have been spoken to us so many times in society
30:39
and really the kingdom culture citizen of Heaven way has not
30:45
been taught that much we have to really do spiritual work to renew our mind
30:51
about the fact that we are all made the same we are all made the same
30:58
and God wants to use every single one of us just as powerfully
31:03
so we can have Humble Hearts to learn from people that look different different than us so we can have Humble Hearts to learn
31:09
from people who are from different countries than us speak a different language than us or from a different
31:15
culture because God's has hidden Revelations and secrets in the for the humble ones to
31:22
find them there remember the Bible says God hides these things
31:28
the Bible says that that God uses the weak and foolish things to confound the wisdom of this
31:35
world God released his Revelations of his kingdom secrets to access the anointing
31:41
to weak and foolish things of this world this is the prophetic word a word of God
31:48
in Isaiah that is that is coming alive now that when it says therefore once more I
31:55
will Astound them with Wonder upon wonder and it Hallelujah
32:01
and it says the wisdom of the wise will perish the intelligence of the intelligent will
32:07
vanish and a big meaning of that is society's intelligence
32:13
society's way of thinking this is supreme this is best this is where we get our knowledge this is where we get
32:20
our Christian knowledge and teaching
32:25
God's now confounding the wisdom of this world now Hallelujah
32:32
Hallelujah thank you Jesus
32:44
so I want to teach now I taught some now about how there can be good aspects of
32:50
culture in the church like how you dress and how
32:55
you worship these are good beautiful things that different cultures have amen so now I want to talk about the fact
33:01
that there are there are some types of culture cultures that bring bad things in the
33:08
church in the American Church It Is by and large the culture
33:17
to have comfort and entertainment
33:22
and lukewarmness and embarrassment of the Holy Spirit
33:31
not a hunger for the Holy Spirit and not embracing the Holy Spirit so therefore
33:36
common culture in the American Church by and large is dryness
33:42
spiritually dry that's very wrong but this is culture this is literally
33:48
like American culture it's culture in America in western church that seeped in
33:54
to the church we want to look nice
34:01
we don't want Holy Spirit to ruffle our feathers or something and we're comfortable
34:08
so many are not in poverty so they're comfortable with life
34:15
and so they're not hungry and they're good with the entertainment stuff in the Charisma and the social
34:20
activities in the church American culture that seeped into the
34:26
American Church and that's wrong and that's very bad the bad part of the American culture
34:33
Western culture and now we see I'm gonna go give you an
34:40
example of a different culture let's look at like the African church the African church
34:46
so the African church in general is the opposite they love the supernatural
34:54
they love the prophecies the Miracles the healing the Deliverance
34:59
and there's a lot of poverty there and so there's people who are in desperation
35:05
and so they have no choice but to seek God to seek the Supernatural and many seek
35:11
God and others seek which doctors but they're so desperate
35:17
that they have no other option but the supernatural that's how we should be that we have no
35:22
other option but God's power that's all we want [Applause]
35:29
Hallelujah and so um you have some Churches in Africa many
35:36
churches that are just as God wants it to be they are embracing the Holy Spirit
35:42
they want the power of God and the power of God is moving there mightily
35:48
that's how it is in my spiritual father's Church in Tanzania thousands healed and delivered every
35:54
Sunday every service and saved and Touched By God's power
36:01
but um whenever there's counterfeit there's the real and whenever is the real there's a counterfeit
36:07
so there's also uh people in Africa that can take advantage of the people who
36:15
need the Supernatural who desired the supernatural there's people with bad hearts who can start Ministries who are
36:21
false prophets who access demonic powers and put on a show a prophetic show
36:28
a miracle show that where God is Not
36:34
but they're preying upon the people's hunger and need and Desperation for the supernatural
36:40
and they come in the wrong Supernatural way so that's an example of how culture can
36:49
influence in a bad way as well in a different culture of church
36:56
in other cultures like um like many Hispanic and also European
37:03
churches they they oh wait wait before I go into
37:08
that I want to mention America Church the idol is entertainment is
37:14
um anything that's not the power of God living for oneself living the lukewarm
37:20
way that's the idol in African church power is the idol
37:25
I'm not saying all churches I'm just saying in some Churches so some Churches power is the idol
37:33
and then in many um Hispanic and European churches for
37:38
example physical objects that you pray to
37:45
are the idols and believing that as you like like instead of believing that Jesus is all
37:52
we need is all the only one we should really pray for because that's who we're receiving all the Miracles from is Jesus alone they will think that they need to
37:59
pray to other Saints um to get to Jesus or other Saints carry different powers
38:06
um and so sometimes they have physical objects or like necklaces and so their Idol has become that
38:13
but that's having to do with culture that has seeped in in a bad way
38:19
right
38:27
and now in the American Church I want to share what the real big Idol
38:33
is the real big Idol in the American Church is politics
38:47
Zachariah 4 verse 1. this is the word of the Lord
38:53
not by might nor by power but by my spirits
39:00
says the Lord of hosts in the old Covenant we're seeing many
39:05
Bible stories of kings and armies and God really working in these areas
39:11
but then in the New Covenant Jesus comes in a completely different way
39:17
there's many partially Old Testament that we bring that we that we find Revelation from God from that applies to
39:23
us today but there's some things in the Old Testament we're just called to reject
39:28
it's part of the old Covenant it's not the New Covenant anymore
39:34
and one of them is this way of coming in might and Power and not by the spirit
39:42
so Jesus in this new covenant in John 18 36 Jesus says my kingdom is not of this
39:47
world if it were my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders but now my kingdom is from
39:54
another place the passion translation says Jesus looked at pilate and said the
40:01
royal power of my kingdom realm doesn't come from this world if it did then my
40:06
followers would be fighting to the end to defend me from the Jewish leaders my kingdom realm Authority is not from this
40:15
realm now so many people missed Jesus and even
40:21
the disciples were confused about Jesus how he was coming in this way because of
40:27
the Old Testament the Kings and the armies
40:34
in in the governments they thought that Jesus was going to come in the government
40:41
and take over the Roman government they thought for sure this is how Jesus was coming
40:47
as a physical Soldier but in the New Covenant he came in a
40:54
completely different way bringing his kingdom culture the kingdom of God my kingdom is not of this world he says
41:04
he says if it were of this world then I would be coming in physical Force I would have an army coming in physical
41:10
Force and I would make myself the King on this world
41:16
the the president the the person in charge of this country
41:21
he didn't come in that way see the way that he came in was
41:29
releasing his kingdom sharing with people about the kingdom of
41:34
God introducing himself as the savior
41:40
coming with love coming in the spiritual realm destroying Yokes and showing people his love
41:47
and what he wanted to happen was for people to decide in their own free will
41:54
to give their lives to him to follow him
41:59
to leave their life completely and follow him that's what he wanted
42:06
and when when people would follow him they would be transformed from the inside
42:13
they would become more like him they would be full of love they would be full of peace they would be full of joy they
42:19
would bring unity and peace to the world they would be World Changers
42:26
because they became like Jesus
42:32
God is all about free will and that's what Jesus was trying to say
42:39
I don't want to force people I want people to come on their own will
42:45
to me and when they come on their own will I will transform them and then the world will be transformed through them
42:54
foreign person by person by person by person but this is the thing
43:00
do you know the most powerful force in the entire world is the anointing
43:07
the anointing the power of God the anointing is the power of God that he puts in a vessel
43:12
and they flows to the vessel and he can do anything he can raise the dead he can heal any kind of sickness he can Castle
43:17
every kind of demon and principality this anointing is truly the most
43:24
powerful force in the universe it is more powerful than any nuclear bomb than
43:31
any physical a weapon that any government has
43:38
it is more powerful than any worldly power and authority that a president
43:43
that a prime minister that a king or queen can have the anointing is supreme the anointing
43:51
is more powerful than it oh
43:56
so imagine if the whole body of Christ were truly vessels of the anointing
44:03
imagine what this world would look like
44:08
thank you it would be radically transformed
44:13
transformed by love and the power of God
44:20
not transformed by force not transformed by judgment not transformed by politics
44:27
not transformed by legal policies not transformed by political officers
44:33
but transformed by the spirit not by might not by power but by the spirit
44:41
[Applause] but the reason why politics political leaders have become an idol in the
44:48
American church is because the American church has not had the power of God
44:54
so they feel very powerless it's like it's like going back to the old Covenant
44:59
it's like they become like helpless no change no change yeah there is no
45:04
change in you there's no power in you yeah you're helpless without the power of God in you and in your church leaders
45:11
yeah yeah they look to other ways
45:16
they become like the people in the times of King Saul God we need a king
45:21
[Music] so
45:27
so without the power of God there's Christians that are desperate for change in the country they see the country
45:32
getting darker of course the country's going to get darker of course the world is going to get darker don't that's no
45:38
surprise is it it's going to get the world's gonna get darker but the light of Jesus will shine brighter we're in the end time Revival
45:44
[Applause]
45:51
and so the people they're concerned it's getting darker it's getting darker we need change we have to stop this we need
45:57
to go back to how we used to be like this change we need to we need a
46:02
king to force change I don't like this many Christians in the church become
46:09
whiny I don't like this I want a king
46:14
I want a king to force people to be more Christian and more morally good
46:23
that's that will become whiny people in the church idolizing political
46:28
leaders because they think that they're going to save the world they're going to change the world they're going to at least get it back to how it was in the
46:34
80s
46:39
and that's where that's where their focus is that's where they're thinking
46:45
that that's the secret that's why in America the politics as the idol
46:51
because no power of God it's true there's no change it's like it's like the world's getting it's like it's like
46:58
America is getting darker and we're not really seeing the light yeah because the anointing hasn't been there but when the anointing comes
47:06
that's gonna Shock the World he's gonna transform this nation but it's gonna but it's gonna happen
47:13
from the inside out you see God wants people to have free will so we need to not be so concerned with
47:20
um laws because laws are not even giving people free will if we force people to be
47:26
christ-like with their morals it's not going to happen you can't force people they're gonna Rebel
47:33
and you know I shared a couple weeks ago about the real way of bringing people to Christ the kindness of God leads to
47:38
repentance so the opposite of kindness is judgment and force you're evil I'm
47:44
forcing this moral way upon you that's Force that's opposite of kind right and so the opposite happens it
47:51
makes people hate Christians it makes people get more impassioned more riled
47:57
up more united to go against the Christian way the moral way
48:03
when we come with Force so this this this way of force is wrong we need to let people have free will
48:10
love them love them because that real change will come I'm telling you if every person
48:15
loved people the right way if every person and if every Christian in America was truly a vessel of the anointing and
48:23
they every person they encountered they love them with the love of God and God's power moves through them really
48:29
and they they become saved they become delivered they become healed and now
48:35
they want to live like Jesus you just changed one person like they
48:41
were living immorally but now they're living christ-like so what if we all did that
48:48
it would be people that's what we want in America and the whole world we want people to have the Free Will and choose
48:53
to live morally to choose to live christ-like we want them to choose that
48:59
and it's possible they just need to know Jesus they need to encounter the
49:05
anointing the real Jesus Hallelujah
49:11
praise God praise God
49:17
thank you Jesus
49:24
God can use political leaders he can absolutely use anybody he wants
49:29
to use everybody he wants to use political leaders but what people don't realize is they
49:34
think that that's where the the whole changing of the world is going to come is if we find this amazing christ-like
49:40
leader they're going to change the whole country God can use a political leader say maybe
49:47
it's a great Christian political leader but the real powerful change is actually going to come at the ground level
49:54
it's going to come through you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you
50:01
and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you that's going to be way more powerful
50:08
it's going to be many more lives changed than one person on a platform
50:15
amen hallelujah hallelujah
50:20
thank you Jesus um and and not only that but the body of Christ is going to be getting a new rep
50:26
as we do this the body of Christ is going to be getting a new reputation of love and Power
50:31
of let the body of Christ will have this new reputation when we start making this change because it's going to be a ripple effect because because right now the
50:38
America the people people who aren't Christians see the church it's ugly it's judgmental
50:45
it's forceful it's not beautiful and full of love and Power
50:50
and it's not a place that can help people but this change that's beginning we're starting to change the reputation people
50:57
will start to change their minds about what the church is this is a place of love this is a place of acceptance this
51:04
is a place that can help me I come to the church and I got delivered I got healed
51:13
that's what God wants to do to change the world change reputation of the church so it's more attractive so
51:19
everyone will want to come and encounter Jesus amen
51:28
so it's time we we start we the the American church has to stop magnifying politics and their political candidate
51:35
more than they magnify Jesus more than they magnify the work of God
51:40
's work it's time this stops it's time this Idol stops amen
51:56
Luke 12 48 someone who does not know and then does something wrong will be punished only
52:02
lightly when someone has been given much much will be required in return
52:07
and when someone has been entrusted with much even more will be required
52:20
so we in America
52:25
we have been given a big responsibility and and this is the the leaders the
52:30
Christian leaders in America need to understand that you've given you've been given a great responsibility because of how Society is many people do look to
52:37
you many people do look to us it's not like it's a bad thing it's how Society is but
52:44
that really means that we are given a great responsibility a great responsibility to present the
52:50
true gospel not the American gospel
52:55
the global gospel the true gospel
53:02
we have this responsibility to get all these wrong Parts out of us this the dry void of the spirit void of
53:09
the anointing that's got to go American Church western church
53:14
the idolizing politics and preaching too much about politics magnifying politics
53:21
has got to stop it's not preaching the accurate gospel
53:26
to the world the world is watching we have this great responsibility
53:31
God has brought Revival to our land [Applause]
53:39
my spiritual father Prophet Dr Jordan he prophesied to me seven months sorry seven years ago this month
53:48
he prophesied to me that I was called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ I was
53:54
called to reach the Nations and within that same about same year he
53:59
prophesied to our church which was small at the time he came all the way from Tanzania to La for this reason only he said God
54:07
sent him to prophesy this that God has heard America's prayers for Revival and
54:14
he has answered them Revival is now for America [Applause]
54:20
Hallelujah and God is pouring out Apostles and Prophets who will spearhead
54:26
this revival who will fulfill the fivefold ministry and complete the parts
54:31
that are missing so we can see the full glory of God full anointing and nothing
54:36
he said I repeat nothing can stop this revival Hallelujah
54:43
and he said it will start in La it will go across the nation and it will go across the whole world and that has
54:50
literally come to pass as we see I don't know how many nations that literally
54:55
came to La the well to encounter God here
55:01
Hallelujah so we have such a responsibility this
55:08
church and anyone who is a part of this revival in America
55:13
and every Christian leader you have a serious we have a serious responsibility to uphold the true gospel to preach the
55:21
true gospel not the American gospel and to see everyone as equal to not have
55:27
pride but to have humility to love our neighbor as ourself in every corner and
55:35
part of the world to give everyone the equal opportunity to love them the same as you love the
55:43
same people from your country and your skin color whatever we have this responsibility because God
55:49
has brought Revival here to release to the world we have this precious grace and favor
55:57
that's undeserved we should not take this lightly and so I'm calling all of you here at fivefold
56:03
church to stand with me on this you we will be a minority
56:08
this American gospel is the is the majority gospel preached we will be the
56:13
