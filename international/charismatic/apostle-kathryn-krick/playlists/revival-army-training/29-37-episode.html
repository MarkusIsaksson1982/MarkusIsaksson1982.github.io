I taught a message called The Power of sewing and today is pretty much a part
0:07
two of The Power of sewing so last week's message I spoke specifically on
0:13
what happens when you sew the great power behind it if you
0:19
have not seen this message definitely make sure you go back on YouTube on my
0:24
YouTube or fful church YouTube and check it out amen I'm going going to be
0:31
teaching how to seow the spiritual way how to sew correctly The Godly way led
0:39
by the holy spirit because there's a right way to sew there's a wrong way to
0:45
se the wrong way would be with your eyes shut just doing something just because
0:53
just doing something out of tradition out of ritual just doing something to
0:59
get by like I've checked off the Box on the list of things I'm supposed to do to be
1:05
a good Christian and I've tithed a little bit these types of things are examples
1:12
of wrong ways of sewing and so today you're going to learn the right way the spiritual way The Godly way because so
1:20
many blessings Abundant Life is connected to your sewing so if you're
1:26
sewing in the wrong way it's going to prohibit you from receiving blessings and abundant life that God intends you
1:32
to have so this is very important amen
1:38
so when we're when we're sewing by the way when I taught last week I was
1:44
speaking there's different types of sewing and last week I taught specifically on sewing into the kingdom
1:50
of God because there's different types of sewing when the Bible talks about sewing it it means your actions it means
1:56
your words uh but also it means giving financially it can mean giving
2:02
financially to others to the poor but then also something separate is giving
2:08
financially sewing into the kingdom of God the house of God the church amen and
2:15
so last Sunday I was speaking specifically on sewing into the church
2:21
the house of God and today it's going to be this same teaching uh this is the
2:26
topic of how to sew spiritually in the house of God in the kingdom of God
2:33
Amen so as you're bringing your seed to the house of God this is a spiritual act
2:40
that you are doing so the the typical like traditional religious way to do it
2:46
is to just give an offering just one like lump sum like here is my offering
2:53
or here is my tithe but that is really doing doing it
3:00
without revelation of the power behind the seed and all that is unlocked as we
3:07
SE there's different things that are unlocked as we sew so the spiritual
3:13
proper way to sew is to sew
3:18
specifically for different things that God wants you to sew
3:24
for it's kind of like there's a garden and God wants you God wants you to sew
3:30
seeds for this kind of plant this kind of plant a different kind of plant a different kind of plant so it produces
3:36
this whole big garden with all these different types of plants that we need
3:41
amen so the first thing that we should be uh sewing specifically for is the
3:50
tithe it says in Malachi chapter 3:8 will man rob God yet you are robbing
3:58
me but but you say how have we robbed you in your tithes and contributions you are cursed with a
4:05
curse for you are robbing me the whole nation of you bring the full tithe into the
4:11
storehouse that there may be food in my house and thereby put me to the test
4:16
says the Lord of hosts if I will not open the windows of Heaven for you and
4:22
pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need I will rebuke the devour for you so
4:29
that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil and your Vine in the field shall not fail to bear says the Lord of
4:35
hosts then all nations will call you blessed for you will be a land of delight says the
4:42
Lord so this this nation uh these people were not giving tithes now tithe is
4:52
defined in the Bible as 10% of the income and these people were not giving
4:59
the tithe that God commanded to give God sees the tithe as belonging to him
5:04
completely that though it's given to you it belongs to him you are more just a
5:10
steward holding on to it but it really belongs to him and we should have this
5:16
mindset as Believers like when we receive uh money when we receive a paycheck that it's really not the whole
5:24
paycheck is ours but just 90% the 10% be belongs to God Amen and
5:33
so these people they were not giving the tithe and God took this so
5:39
seriously he's saying you are robbing me and he speaks that there is a curse
5:46
upon them because they were robbing God from giving the tithe now we are in the New Covenant now
5:55
amen and so when people wouldn't do certain things they were curses that
6:01
would come upon people they would be considered defiled Jesus came and destroy the curse
6:08
of the law amen but there is so much of the Old
6:14
Testament that still applies to us today it's just that we're no longer under the law and the repercussions of not doing
6:22
it are different it's not that we are cursed it's not that we are now dirty def filed
6:31
unsaved if you disobey a command if you sin but there are repercussions
6:39
still there are consequences still it's like this when you if you go
6:46
and steal something from somebody there's going to be repercussions consequences whether
6:52
you're a Believer or not right um whether it's something small or
6:57
something big whether you get caught or not so if it's something of like big
7:02
monetary value that you steal from someone and you're a Believer or not you could be arrested right just because
7:10
you're a Believer and you're no longer under the law doesn't mean that you can steal and there's no repercussions you
7:17
see what I'm saying and even if it's something smaller or something big but you didn't
7:23
get caught you don't have those like physical repercussions but there's still
7:28
repercussions you just open up the door for the voice of condemnation hardcore to come in your
7:36
life there's definitely repercussions right and so that's how it is now in the
7:42
New Covenant with withholding the tithe when you withhold the tithe you're
7:49
withholding what the the seed that is releasing blessings to your life you are
7:55
you are withholding the seed that is bringing bringing protection over your
8:02
finances it says that when they bring the tithe it says that when you do
8:09
this the I will open up the windows of heaven and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need so many
8:17
blessings God will bring when you bring the tithe he also then says I will rebuke the devour for you so that it
8:24
will not destroy the fruits of your soil so
8:30
when you bring tithe The Reaping that's unlocked is protection over your
8:36
finances so that the devil cannot touch your finances cannot come and
8:43
steal people in the world do not have this kind of protection and Believers that don't tithe don't have this kind of
8:50
protection anything can happen to the finances at any time there's no Supernatural protection without the
8:56
tithe hallu so that that is what happens and also your Vine in the field
9:04
shall not fail to bear so it also means that you're not going to be stuck in
9:09
stagnancy but you're going to keep on uh uh getting more and more provision going
9:15
glory to glory as you tithe Hallelujah so that's the first way to se
9:24
is recognizing 10% of my income now this isn't this
9:29
under the law now but God still wants us to do this there's so many commands in
9:35
the Old Testament like Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not commit adultery they're in the Old
9:42
Testament but they didn't go away in the New Testament there's still commands from God and this is still a command
9:49
from God hallelujah so you should think
9:54
spiritually 10% belongs to God and you should have the fear of God knowing
10:00
if I withhold this I'm literally robbing from God this is serious number one number two this is not going to be good
10:06
for me for my finances so it should be very simple and straightforward with the fear of God 10%
10:14
of what I receive is God's amen this is also the way to receive
10:21
even if you even if you're at a season in life where you only have $1 doll
10:30
20% of that is 20 cents right am I doing the math right it's pretty easy math I hope
10:35
so 20 cents so even giving 20 cents does something powerful in the
10:42
spiritual realm it's seen by God as a tithe and literally Supernatural
10:48
blessings will then come from that 20 cents and not only that but the Devourer
10:55
is rebuked from taking the the N the 80 cents that you have have and what will
11:00
come later amen it's a it's a true spiritual
11:05
principle it doesn't make sense in this world it's truly spiritual but it's real
11:10
and it's powerful principle that does not fail test that's why God says test me in this I want to bless you I want
11:18
your finances to be protected I want you to prosper so test
11:25
me Deuteronomy 12:6
11:31
bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices your tithes and special gifts
11:36
what you have vowed to give and your free will
11:42
offerings so here we see that God is asking us to give more
11:49
than just the tithes but he's calling us to give special gifts he's calling us to give free will
11:58
offering and he's calling us to give
12:03
sacrifices for a lot of people for example 10% isn't much of a sacrifice
12:09
right it's a very little minority and it doesn't hurt many people like hurt it
12:15
never is going to hurt you but like it it doesn't feel like painful like where am I going to get money for my bills or
12:22
food for a lot of people 10% isn't much of a sacrifice so he's calling us to
12:28
make sacrifices actual sacrifices beyond the tithe and special gifts and Free
12:34
Will offerings so now we're going to go into a category of Free Will offerings so we
12:41
should have in our hearts I give the tithe to God and I also will give free will offerings and
12:49
sacrifices and there's different kinds that we should be thinking of so that
12:54
we're making sure we have all the plans we're not forgetting anything we're not neglecting to give God to give thanks to
13:00
God in this way to make sacrifice to God in this way amen so
13:09
um Mark 12:41 Jesus sat down opposite the temple
13:17
treasury so the temple so the house of God that would be the Church of today
13:23
and he began watching how the people were putting money into the treasury at
13:28
the Temple and many rich people were putting in large sums a poor Widow came
13:35
and put in two small copper coins which amount to a might calling his disciples
13:41
to him he said to them I assure you and most solemnly say to you this poor Widow
13:47
put in proportionately more than all the contributors to the
13:53
treasury for they all contributed from their Surplus but she from her poverty
14:01
put in all she had all she had to live
14:06
on now Jesus was amazed by this he loved this this was beautiful to him in the
14:13
world's way this woman would be called stupid and foolish and in a Pharisee mind she would
14:22
have been called stupid and foolish and wasteful she should have at least given it to someone else in need like as as
14:31
the that one Judas he said why to the woman why are you wasting this perfume
14:37
this expensive perfume on Jesus on Jesus's feet right now you could have sold that and given it to the poor but
14:44
there was a meaning behind her giving this sacrifice and expensive things it was Jesus was
14:51
symbolizing God the kingdom of God the work of God the the church amen so the Pharisees would call
15:00
her stupid foolish the people in the world would call her stupid and foolish that's all she had to eat so now what
15:06
she's gonna what she how's she going to eat that's how the world sees it but Jesus saw this as beautiful and good and
15:15
amazing and that's something really really powerful for us to remember in
15:22
our own lives you know that that giving um to the point of sacrifice is
15:30
important to God this is New Testament this is this is Jesus's time right so we
15:38
we know that sacrificing sacrificing financially in the house of God is
15:44
important to God and is seen as beautiful these rich people they were
15:49
giving probably like 10% you know and he's he's not like amazed and impressed
15:55
and even like touched by what they were giving but he was so touched by this woman who gave
16:02
all that should make us you know realize realize something
16:09
that sacrificing financially sewing into God's kingdom to the place where it's a
16:15
sacrifice is so important to God
16:21
Amen so really I I mentioned before that like when you see the paycheck or
16:26
whatever you receive money you receive money we should see it as 90% is ours
16:31
and 10% belongs to God but if we want to go even more
16:37
spiritually like deeper spiritually like mature we should see that it all belongs
16:43
to God yeah I mean the 10% it's like you
16:51
are robbing God if you don't give but the 90%
16:59
God it's it's yours but you are a steward of this we should see it in that
17:04
way that maybe we're not robbing God but we're not being the greatest Steward
17:10
when we don't give past the 10% maybe we're not robbing God but we're not being a good Steward the best Steward
17:18
we're not really seeing surrendering every part of our life we're not really surrendering our finances we're not
17:25
surrendering 100% of our finances only 10% but God wants our full
17:30
surrender that includes every single part of your life that includes your
17:37
finances amen so when you can see that all of
17:44
your money belongs to God you see this this is God's I didn't do anything to
17:50
work or deserve this this is only here in my hand because God gave me the
17:55
ability to have the job by God's grace Grace I have received this it's all
18:02
God even when you work so hard for it it's God still that deserves the
18:10
credit and you could have worked so hard and that money could not have come it is only by God's grace you have received
18:17
this amen when you see things rightly in this way you will be a good Steward
18:24
money won't have a hold on you you will give the amount God wants you to give where where he wants you to give it so
18:31
this is the most important thing I can tell you as I'm sharing with you how to
18:36
so surrender everything surrender your finances 100% of it and have the fear of
18:43
God in this area take it seriously don't take it lightly
18:53
amen Philippians 4:18
19:01
at the moment I have all I need and more we read this scripture by the way last Sunday this is Apostle Paul speaking and
19:10
he is speaking this he's speaking this to the people in The church here in
19:16
Philippi he's saying to them he's thanking them for giving for
19:21
sewing into his ministry he's thanking them and he's saying how much it meant
19:28
to him and how important their their sacrifice their offering was and so he's saying because of you I have all I need
19:35
now and more because you have given offering I am generously supplied with the gifts that you sent me with
19:45
aitis epodes they are a sweet smelling sacrifice that is acceptable and
19:51
pleasing to God and this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs needs from
19:59
his glorious riches which have been given to us in Christ Jesus now what now many people know this
20:05
scripture very well this scripture that says this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his
20:12
glorious riches many people know this verse very well but the many people
20:18
don't know the context of this verse it really matters the context it really matters when Paul says this he's
20:27
saying this to the people who had just sowed offering made
20:33
sacrifice and then he says this word he's not saying this generally to
20:39
everyone he's saying what he's saying is your seed is
20:44
releasing needs and blessings from God to come upon your
20:51
life you will reap this you will reap the needs that you have because you've
20:57
sowed and so this next area of a specific area
21:05
of seed of of special gift offering sacrifice category is sewing for a
21:16
need knowing that as you seow God releases it's not just that God
21:23
releases um random blessings when we sew
21:29
but when we sew God releases blessings that we need things that we
21:35
need so sometimes when you don't have a certain need in your life it could be because you're not sowing enough for the
21:42
reaping of that need to come and sometimes God can be asking you
21:50
to maybe you are maybe you are regularly sewing but maybe God is asking you to sacrifice more and then that that need
21:58
will be released when you sew more in this area so if you have a certain need in
22:06
your life spiritual physical and you're just seeing this is not coming you're
22:11
wondering what what should I do what do I do this is a problem seow make a
22:18
sacrifice to God whenever you seow blessings are released you need a
22:24
blessing in this area so so that you may reap this
22:31
amen so you can make a specific seed like say it with a name like God I'm I'm
22:37
sewing this for this need I believe that you are releasing this to me now
22:42
remember last week I shared that that there is never such thing as a
22:47
transaction or paying God for something to release something it's the principle
22:53
of sewing and reaping don't get it twisted
22:58
but so many people they reject you know giving to God for something that they
23:04
literally are missing out on the sewing and reaping important principle that God has instructed us to do and so they're
23:11
missing out on Abundant Life they're praying and praying and praying for a certain need but they're religious and
23:18
they refuse to accept this new wine
23:23
principle and the need never comes the need is never released
23:29
it's better that we humble ourselves what I'm teaching is new wine it is not the old traditional way we're
23:37
used to but it's the new wine test just test
23:42
God in this test him in it and you will see if you don't believe head on over to
23:50
my social media my Instagram story almost every day I'm seeing testimonies
23:56
of this certain um principal I had this need I swed I made
24:02
a sacrifice and this need came I think just just actually last
24:07
night I just shared a testimony on my Instagram story go look and see and test God
24:26
Amen First Kings
24:36
17:10 so um God is saying to Prophet Elijah right
24:42
now go at once to Zer zerath in the region of sidon and stay there I have
24:49
direct directed a widow there to supply you with food but why doesn't God just
24:55
send food from the sky for Elijah
25:00
this is how God advances his kingdom I mean this is
25:06
how God brings provision for his servants and everything that's needed for the work of God is through
25:14
people this is God's system this is God's way we sh I talked about this last week how the ministry of Jesus was
25:21
financially supported by women by disciples Jesus wasn't just like
25:27
snapping and money burst in his hands you know because this is God's way it's
25:33
still God's way Hallelujah so God says I have directed a widow there to supply you with
25:39
food so he went to zerath when he came to the Town Gate a widow was there Gathering sticks he called to her and
25:46
asked would you bring a me a little water in a jar so I may have a drink as
25:52
she was going to get it he called and bring me please a piece of bread
25:58
now the Widow this Widow says I don't have any bread only a handful of flour in a jar
26:05
and a little olive oil in a jug I'm gathering a few sticks to take home and
26:10
make a meal for myself and my son on that we may eat it and die so God has so
26:17
many people to choose from to bring provision for his servant you'd think he
26:23
would you know logically you would think he would send a rich woman a rich man
26:28
somebody rich not someone that literally is so poor she's about to die because
26:35
she's that poor that's as poor as you can get but this is who God
26:42
chose and he's asking this poor woman with just a crumb ready to die to give
26:49
her crumb
26:54
yeah First Kings 17:13 Elijah said to her don't be afraid go
27:00
home and do as you have said but first make a small loaf of bread from me from what you have and bring it to me and
27:06
then make something for yourself and your son for this is what the Lord the god of Israel says the jar of flour will
27:12
not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord sends rain on the land she went away and did
27:19
as Elijah had told her so there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her family for the jar of flour was
27:27
not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry in keeping with the word of the
27:32
Lord spoken by Elijah this is the principle of sewing
27:38
and reaping when you sew into the kingdom of God that I'm talking about that I'm trying to teach you the power
27:45
of she swed into the kingdom of God she brought the provision to the servant of
27:53
God the ministry of God representing the church and she
27:59
reaped so much Supernatural provision continually in her life she was about to
28:07
die because she had a crumb left and all she did was offer the
28:12
little small loaf of bread just something small that she had the small thing that she had and God gave her so
28:19
much more and just kept giving her so much more it never was running
28:26
dry so so so the world can think this is
28:32
foolish and stupid why is God asking this poor woman to give her last little
28:37
Crum crumb of bread before she dies that's the world how the world sees it
28:44
but this is the kingdom of God principle God knew that as she
28:49
sowed she would reap so God was saving the Widow this was God's grace he saw this
28:57
Widow with was in need and he knew the way to receive financially the spiritual
29:02
principle was for her to sew sure God could just supernaturally release food release provision to her
29:08
from the sky but this isn't his principle nowadays except for exceptions like in
29:15
the wilderness right but his main way his principle is this sewing and reaping
29:21
into the kingdom of God and he doesn't go against his word so he says you sow so then I can
29:29
Bless you that's what happened so there was a need she had a
29:35
great need she had a great need for food for provision and the answer was to
29:42
seow into the kingdom of God to the servant of God that was the answer that's what
29:48
would release the blessings so that's why I say so for a need do what this
29:54
Widow did so God can release to you like he
29:59
did to the
30:09
Widow the next kind of seed is for those who are serious about
30:19
walking in the anointing carrying God's power the next kind of seed is sewing a
30:27
seed to connect to the [Music]
30:33
anointing it says in Proverbs 11:24 one gives freely yet Grows All the Richer
30:41
another withholds what he should give and only suffers want whoever brings blessing will be enriched and one who
30:48
Waters will himself be
30:53
watered you need to water this anointing that you are
30:59
receiving you need to Value God needs to see that you value the anointing to
31:05
release more because God is so serious about the principles of his kingdom his principles
31:12
of impartation you know he raises up certain a servant of God Servants of God
31:19
he raises up a servant of God he instructs them to Start Ministry start a church he he takes them through the
31:26
refining fire and he he molds them until they can be this pure vessel of God so
31:33
that he can put Mighty anointing in they become modern day like Apostle Paul
31:38
Apostle Peter Prophet Elijah and then God calls disciples to come people to
31:45
come and come under serve under be a part of that church be a part of that Ministry be a part of that work of
31:52
God and as they do that as they serve as they surrender the anointing is imparted
32:00
from that leader from the modern-day Apostle Paul Apostle Peter Prophet
32:05
Elijah it is imparted to the people so this is God's
32:11
system th God's system of equipping his church doing the work of God releasing
32:19
impartation is very important he doesn't go against his system it's very
32:24
important you know it takes a while for that real anointing to be released into a servant you can't just go get
32:31
anointing any old way go in your room pray all day fast all day for many days
32:36
and the anointing comes no this anointing is so precious and so you have
32:43
God needs to see that you value the anointing you have received not that you
32:49
just receive the anointing and you go do whatever you
32:54
want you you you need you need to realize that the anointing is from Jesus but it's also from Jesus through a
33:01
servant of God that God is doing most of his work through
33:08
vessels and so we have to be honoring for others to be able to
33:14
receive if we are not honoring then we are basically saying we don't need
33:19
anybody we can do things our own way and that halts the flow of the anointing the
33:25
move of God the Miracles being released you if you you can't receive
33:32
the anointing you don't honor and so part of
33:38
honoring is giving sewing into that Ministry
33:43
where you have received from that's a big part of
33:49
honor and whenever you bring seed there is a reaping we don't give just to receive
33:57
but we should have the Revelation like I get to receive as I give this is exciting Hallelujah that's not bad it's
34:04
a good thing it's sewing and reaping amen so when we give we should we
34:11
sometimes give just because we love God right just cuz thank thank you Lord I love you I just give not thinking about
34:18
anything to receive but every time you sew you do reap and so there's different things you're reaping as you're sewing
34:24
for different things that's why I'm saying this important import of sewing spiritually sewing specifically I'm
34:30
sewing for this need and that need is released so when you
34:36
sew thanking God for this anointing you've seen now in your life moving through you thanking God that now you're
34:43
seeing people's lives be touched be healed be delivered when you seow with that Thanksgiving that you've received
34:49
that anointing into that Ministry that You' received importation from there is a reaping that comes from that and it's
34:55
not a random reaping but as you SE with that Heart of Thanksgiving into that anointing
35:01
thanking God for that anointing you received more anointing comes upon you in that area more anointing of
35:07
impartation comes upon you in that area you are watching I've received this anointing of impartation impartation of
35:13
anointing in my life I'm watering this and then you are watered as it says one who Waters will
35:22
himself be watered so you're like coming to the place you have received the anointed impartation you're bringing
35:28
this seed you're watering I value this anointing with my seed I value it I value this anointing
35:36
with of impartation in my life I value it more of that anointing comes upon you
35:42
when you receive anointing you release it and it goes you have to keep on receiving
35:47
more so there's so so so if people receive impartation some people can just come here they can just come here
35:54
pastors can just come here and receive impartation and they will see God move in power they
35:59
will see miracles happen through them aftering impartation but if they don't water
36:06
where they have received from it will dry up the Miracles will stop
36:12
flowing you have to value and honor where God has released to you
36:18
from and so when you Watcher more anointing comes upon you and it increases in size as you keep doing that
36:26
as you go glory to glory so this is one of the other areas
36:32
of sewing connecting to the anointing it's a point of
36:40
contact in the spiritual realm hallelujah
36:50
hallelujah this next seed this next kind of sewing next next
36:58
kind of offering is a Thanksgiving seed so we should be giving to God just
37:07
out of Thanksgiving just to thank God for who
37:13
he is for the blessings he's given so you sew you know I'm sewing and I know I will reap this as I sew but then
37:19
sometimes you should sew just to thank God specifically just as a Thanksgiving
37:26
seed and when you sew this Thanksgiving
37:32
seed it releases blessing and favor upon your
37:38
life the Bible says Psalm 1476 the Lord lifts up the
37:44
humble the Lord lifts up the humble one of the big ways to show to test if someone's humble
37:53
is if they are grateful if they are a grateful person
37:58
and so when God is looking to see if someone's humble he is testing different things he's testing
38:04
your thoughts your heart your words and your actions to see if they are humble
38:12
and part of these actions is sewing I am grateful to God for what you
38:17
have done I am giving a sacrifice and thanking you Lord there's a lifting that comes from
38:24
that seed God lifts The Humble this is part of God lifting The Humble bringing blessings bringing favor
38:32
Upon Your Life opening up opening up doors this comes from the Thanksgiving
38:40
seed Hallelujah and
38:46
also when God has done something very big like deliver you from demonic
38:54
oppression this is something very very very big many people are stuck with demonic oppression for many years and
39:01
and and the anointing is rare today so it's even even bigger thing that God does when God frees a person they're no
39:09
longer stuck with demons living inside of them controlling them forcing them to
39:16
drink and drink and drink and do drugs and watch porn and do masturbation and
39:22
sleep around and have anxiety all the time and have depression all the time it's a big deal when God delivers you
39:31
amen [Applause]
39:37
hallelujah and so when God delivers you you should be
39:43
grateful and you should show your gratitude in every way by testifying by
39:50
surrendering everything serving him and by sewing into his kingdom where you
39:56
have re receive that anointing where that anointing that anointing most people are freed by the
40:03
anointing that destroys the Yoke as you come to where the power of God is moving in the church in the
40:09
ministry that is where you have received the anointing so you should give thanks to God that he has freed you
40:16
specifically when that happens and and if it's if it's like
40:21
today some of you will be free today but you won't feel anything physically
40:26
so Thanksgiving out of Faith believe you are free thank you
40:32
Lord for freeing me today it will do powerful things in the spiritual
40:40
realm once again as I said when we seow we shouldn't do it with the heart of
40:45
getting anything from God like a transaction but we should be spiritually aware that there's a reaping that's
40:52
coming from this and the different kinds of reapings you
40:57
need so when you seow thanking God for delivering
41:03
you there is a specific reaping that comes from that specific seed not a
41:08
random reaping but the specific reaping is an increase of anointing releasing
41:16
protection over you to keep you protected from demons entering
41:21
again to help you maintain your deliverance
41:28
to help your spiritual eyes to open up to discern the schemes of the devil
41:33
trying to get you to open up a door again so we can come back in and so there's a scripture in the
41:41
Bible that says when one demon goes he's looking to see if he can come back and he wants to bring his friends he wants
41:46
to bring more and when he sees that the vessel is basically empty swept clean in
41:52
order the meaning of that is they are not surrendered to God filling themselves with the Holy Spirit and all
41:58
that entails being planted where God's power is taking it seriously being
42:03
equipped to grow in the spirit to be in his word all of that entails and it also
42:09
means sewing bringing sacrifice to God so if
42:15
you're missing some of these things some of these areas included in surrender
42:21
demon sees a way back in to bring more
42:27
that's the big summary of what it means to make sure no demons come back that's the big summary of what it means to make
42:33
you sure you're filled and not they don't see it empty surrender surrender in every area
42:40
following God's commands his principles his new wine
42:46
principles which includes sewing and so as you sew thanking
42:54
God for freeing you you a reaping of more anointing comes upon you to help
43:00
you maintain your deliverance of protection specifically
43:06
protection in this area and helping you spiritually to mature so the devil can't trick
43:15
you the devil can be so sneaky and speak lies and get people thinking they aren't
43:20
really delivered and so they start confessing things lies and opens up a door the devil becomes so sneaky we need
43:28
to not take this lightly when you've been delivered don't take it lightly
43:33
follow all God's principles thank God for freeing you SE sew into God's
43:38
kingdom thanking him specifically for freeing you I want all the anointing I can get I don't want to miss out on all
43:44
the reaping I need all the reaping
43:55
Hallelujah and the last area of of sewing now this isn't for everyone
44:03
this is so everything that I just shared is for everyone is for all of
44:10
you that this should be part of your sewing life spiritual sewing life to be
44:16
thinking about these things specifically and you can um declare these things write these things down
44:22
this seed is for this watch God do it
44:28
I'm planning this here for this I know this is going to come you're going to see that plant come upon what you've sewed
44:36
amen now this last area of sewing isn't for everybody this is only for some
44:43
people and this this category right here is
44:48
sewing to unlock complete deliverance this is not the answer for
44:54
everyone who needs Deliverance an but sometimes it is a key that unlocks Deliverance complete
45:02
deliverance now I was sharing I believe two weeks
45:08
ago about how there are different levels of demons as it says as it says in
45:14
Ephesians 6 that we are not in a war against flesh and blood but in the spiritual realm is
45:22
the war we were in against principalities being the highest demonic power against rulers being the second
45:29
demonic power and there's different translations that name these different things but there's two other
45:35
levels two other two other levels of different demonic powers different translations have different names for
45:40
them but what's important to understand is that there's these different levels principalities being the highest lower
45:48
level demons more power even more power and highest power demonic power
45:54
principality and so without the
46:00
anointing it's rare that any of those demons go but with small
46:07
anointing sometimes the lower level demons go but with the small anointing it can't
46:15
deal with above the lower level and when there's powerful
46:21
anointing here like in the church these small smaller level demons
46:27
they they they go real fast because there's so much power of God smaller level demons there's not as
46:35
many spiritual Keys needed to unlock those chains that make the demon
46:43
go and so I shared how sometimes I can be preaching and a demon leaves somebody when you hear them screaming
46:49
and leaving during the sermon you can know that's that's a lower level demon that couldn't even make it through the
46:54
sermon [Applause]
47:03
Hallelujah but then at the end I am specifically declaring you demon you
47:09
have to go there's power in your words this how you execute your author one of the big ways you execute your Authority
47:14
declaring commanding so we have we have uh Mass Deliverance here every Sunday
47:20
praise God and it's truly Mass deliverance and I command I Spirit of
47:25
addiction has to go Spirit of anxiety has to go I command certain things right and what happens many
47:32
times scream scream demon leave demon leave here they're everywhere
47:39
right so those were the were more higher powerered demons than the ones that left
47:46
during the message there was another key needed key number one was to was to be where the
47:52
anointing is key number two was for the command to be
47:59
issued and there could have been a key number three that was needed was that for that person to
48:05
renounce but there's more keys even sometimes that are needed for
48:13
principalities to go for more extreme cases of demonic
48:20
oppression for a great entanglement of demonic chains in a person's life
48:26
and that's true there are some cases that aren't that are smaller and there are some cases that are
48:32
big in terms of the Demonic oppression that's true and this should be obvious
48:38
in the state of the with the state of the body of Christ today I mean we see so many there are more Christians
48:44
oppressed than free probably and it's not just because the
48:50
anointing is rare but it's also because the Revelation the new one Revelation that
48:56
there are different prophetic Keys needed to unlock people is missing as well and the spirit of religion hates
49:04
the new wine Revelation so much that they will try to shut down
49:11
these precious keys that God is
49:17
releasing and this last key is the religious cannot stand
49:22
it cannot stand it it's the devil that cannot stand
49:28
it because all of the secrets will be out all of the
49:35
secrets of how the devil's able to keep people in such intense bondage no matter
49:42
how much prayer no matter how many people scream at a
49:47
demon the secret will be out and everybody could be free just
49:53
like in the times of Jesus the times of apostle Paul apostle so Peter all were healed all were
50:04
free and so I I don't know a single a single Minister hardly today except
50:12
maybe my spiritual father but except my spiritual father I'll say this but if I were to say I don't know any Minister
50:18
that could say yes I've seen every demon leave every service I I'm able to cast out every
50:26
kind of demon if you honestly ask them deep down if they honestly answer they'll probably
50:32
say no this demon I couldn't figure out how to make it go this person was stuck with their mental
50:39
problem after all this prayer and fasting I don't know but there are answers the new wine
50:46
answers but we have to be humble to receive them in the times of apostle Paul and
50:52
Peter all demons were going it's in the word of God it talks about the shout of apostle
50:59
Apostle Peter all were healed all a 100% were
51:10
healed and this is what God wants today now it's not supposed to be just a thing
51:15
of the past God wants to free all of his people
51:20
[Applause] now not just those with lower level
51:25
demons he wants to free all of them all of the principalities must
51:31
go but they're not going to go without this new wine Revelation that the
51:36
religious cannot stand and will say is
51:42
wrong amen so um we have to be real with
51:48
ourselves if we're not seeing the results that Peter Paul the acts Church
51:54
did were all were healed every demon went we have to be real with ourselves
52:00
we are missing Revelation in the spiritual realm we have the Bible so it
52:06
means it has to be holy spirit breathing upon the word releasing fresh new new
52:11
wine Revelation I don't have the scripture written here but there's a scripture that talks about how we are given
52:18
different gifts of the holy spirit everyone's given different kinds of gifts you know the scripture and one of the things it mentions is an
52:24
illumination of the holy spirit that he brings meaning prophetic Revelation prophetic keys this is what's needed for
52:31
this person to be delivered that's the meaning so it's
52:37
biblical for there to be new wine prophetic Revelation this is what's needed for
52:43
this person to be delivered that's biblical
52:48
[Applause] Hallelujah see you can't you cannot just say it's only just commanding and
52:55
renouncing that makes all demons go no sometimes we need the illumination of the Holy Spirit to release new fresh
53:02
prophetic Revelation
53:07
Hallelujah so in First Kings
53:19
3:4 the king went to gibian to sacrifice there this was
53:24
Solomon Solomon went to sacrifice for this was the great high place Solomon
53:30
offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar in gibian the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream at night and God
53:37
said ask me what I shall give you give your servant an understanding mind and a hearing heart with which to judge your
53:43
people so that I may discern between good and evil we'll go on to verse 12 God said
53:50
behold I have done as you asked I have given you a wise and Discerning heart and mind so that no one before you was your equal nor shall anyone equal to you
53:57
arise after you I have also given you what you have not asked both wealth and honor so that there will not be anyone
54:04
equal to you among the Kings for all your days so a lot of people know once again a lot of people know this
54:10
scripture about how Solomon asked or God asked Solomon what do you want I will
54:16
give it to you because I have so much favor and love for you specifically you to ask you
54:23
this and Solomon says what he says and God gives him even more many know this
54:28
right but many do not know the context Solomon brought sacrifice to God
54:37
and immediately after he brought sacrifice God shows up and not just
54:43
shows up says ask anything and I will give it to you and that sacrifice
54:49
touched God's heart so much that God decided to give him way more than what he asked for blessings physical
54:56
blessings seek the seek first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added to you seek first the kingdom in every way through sewing
55:04
through making sacrifice included hallelujah hallelujah so we see this
55:10
power in bringing sacrifice God's hand coming and moving and releasing blessing
55:15
releasing Miracles amen and then we see in 2 Samuel
55:23
24:8 Gad came to David King David and said to him go up set up an altar to the
55:29
Lord on the threshing floor so David went up according to God's word I'm skipping forward a little bit he went uh
55:36
why has my Lord the king come to his servant and David said to buy the threshing floor from you to build an
55:42
altar to the Lord so so that the plague may be held back from the people and then our arua said to David
55:50
let my Lord the king Take and offer up whatever seems good to him look here are oxen for the burnt offering offering and threshing sledges and yolks of The Oxen
55:56
for the wood all of this I give to you he's saying um May the Lord God be
56:02
favorable to you but the King David said no I will certainly buy it from you for
56:09
a price I will not offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God which cost me
56:16
nothing this shows the power of us personally making sacrifice amen David
56:22
would not accept this money basically from to give the offering it had to cost
56:29
him something he knew for it to touch God's heart this sacrifice
56:36
amen so David purchased the threshing floor in the oxen for 50 shekel of silver David built an altar to the Lord
56:43
there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings so the Lord was moved to
56:49
compassion by David's prayer for the land and the plague was held back from Israel
56:56
W so David brought sacrifice that cost him something and open the door for
57:03
God's Mighty hand to come and release Miracles release deliverance from the
57:10
plague it says so so then God was
57:16
moved Hallelujah Noah Genesis
57:22
8:20 Noah built an altar to the Lord and took of every ceremonial clean animal and every clean bird and offered burnt
57:28
offerings on the altar now this was after the flood ended he came to land
57:34
for the first time so after Noah brought this sacrifice the Lord smelled the
57:40
pleasing Aroma a soothing satisfying scent and the Lord said to himself I will never again curse the ground
57:47
because of man for the intent of man's heart is wicked from his Youth and I will never again destroy every living
57:54
thing as I have done so this Mighty miracle of God
57:59
making this promise and releasing protection over Noah and all of humanity
58:05
and all of us today came after Noah gave a sacrifice
58:12
directly after you start to see the connection of
58:18
Miracles taking place after sacrifices made to God it's in the Bible
58:26
amen hallelujah
58:38
and remember back in
58:47
um back in Philippians 4:18 that we read earlier when Paul's speaking to the
58:53
people that we're giving him offering remember what he says in verse 18 that
58:59
the offerings they give are a sweet smelling sacrifice that is acceptable and pleasing to God New Testament
59:09
Hebrews and we we we see in this scripture that we just read we see that
59:14
the Lord smelled Genesis 8:20 the Lord smelled the pleasing Aroma a soothing
59:20
satisfying scent and then the Lord release This
59:25
Promise so we cannot ex out this principle from God just because it's in
59:32
the Old Testament we can see how it's brought into the New Testament it is still a
59:39
sweet smelling fragrance to God that has
59:45
power that releases Miracles just as it was in the Old
59:50
Testament Hallelujah Luke 5:14 Jesus ordered this
59:58
person with Leprosy that he healed to tell no one but go and show yourself to
1:00:03
the priest and make an offering for your purification just as Moses commanded as
1:00:09
a testimony to them that this is the work of the Messiah so God was actually instructing
1:00:18
him as he said as he prayed for him he instructed him to sew a seed into the house of God for this healing nothing's
1:00:27
a transaction remember but this was a prophetic direction that Jesus was
1:00:32
giving specifically him it wasn't to everybody but specifically to him to
1:00:38
fully receive and keep this healing he had just received this is in the New Testament
1:00:51
amen Hebrews 11:4 this is the passion translation Faith moved Abel to choose a more
1:00:58
acceptable sacrifice to offer God than his brother Cain this is referring to Genesis 4:3 in the course of time Cain
1:01:05
brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord and Abel also brought an offering fat portions from
1:01:10
some of the firstborn of his flock the Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering so this New Testament scripture
1:01:18
in Hebrews New Covenant is speaking of is referring to this that
1:01:25
that Abel brought an acceptable sacrifice to God he really brought a
1:01:31
true sacrifice and it says in Hebrews 11:4 Faith moved able to choose a more
1:01:38
acceptable sacrifice to offer God than his brother Cain and God declared him righteous because of his offering of
1:01:43
Faith by his faith Abel still speaks instruction to us today even though he is long
1:01:49
dead so this story in the Old Testament the importance of bringing this sacrifice and the Miracles that came
1:01:55
from this sacrifice is still speaking to us today is still speaking instruction
1:02:00
to us today that there's power in your seed that can sometimes release the power of
1:02:06
God to bring freedom in your life amen
1:02:12
so for um some people their their the Demonic oppression they have is very
1:02:20
strong different examples one can be that there was generations of Witchcraft
1:02:26
done so that there has been so much sewing into the kingdom of darkness and there has been a true
1:02:33
reaping of bondage from the kingdom of darkness in their generation person to
1:02:40
person sometimes there's witch now the devil demands the devil steals the the
1:02:45
principles of God because there's power in the principles of God so he twists them and
1:02:51
uses them for bad he knows there's power in it still so he literally asks his
1:02:57
servants to make sacrifices to make blood sacrifices people will literally
1:03:02
they they will Servants of the devil witches will put curses on people that will bring death to a
1:03:09
person send demonic spirits to them and that brings a person death if they don't have
1:03:15
Jesus or if they aren't protected where the anointing is and they're not open up to the new wine to get out of this curse
1:03:21
to get out of this bondage like what I'm sharing today and the people will really die you see things like these demonic
1:03:28
concerts sometimes and people tons of people dying at one time it doesn't makees sense logically it's
1:03:36
spiritual there's dark stuff going on that's that's hidden there's witches putting curses on
1:03:42
people using demons and without the power of God in your life demonic power is stronger than you without the power
1:03:49
of God so it's working people are getting curses on them people are dying
1:03:55
from these curses and when they die that's counted as a sacrifice to the devil from that
1:04:01
witch that did that and that gives them more demonic powers that gives them blessings from
1:04:08
the devil but the blessings of God God come without sorrow so the blessings from the devil come with sorrow come
1:04:14
with hell in your life more demons for in your life you get one thing and you get a lot
1:04:20
of bad things that surpass the good thing like success or whatever or
1:04:26
money right that's what's going on in the spiritual realm this kind of deep
1:04:32
dark witchcraft stuff's going on where sacrifices are being made demonic
1:04:37
sacrifices and people pay prices for these sacrifices these witches they pay money
1:04:45
they make money they send money to the devil as sacrifices sending it to a
1:04:51
person saying this person they'll be cursed they take their own money lots of money
1:04:57
and make sacrifice to the devil that this person would have this curse and so what ends up happening in
1:05:03
these these deep demonic cases is people have these curses from Deep witchcraft on
1:05:09
them these demons aren't going to go in the sermon these demons aren't going to go just by the command it's deeper it's
1:05:15
so much deeper than this and so the prophetic key that's
1:05:23
needed in this this case is sacrificing to God making a sacrifice into the
1:05:29
kingdom of God it's like there is a demonic reaping
1:05:34
that's come upon your life it could be from Generations back it wasn't even doors that you opened it could have been
1:05:39
witchcraft sent upon your life but there's a demonic reaping that has come in your
1:05:46
life and to get that reaping out is not only the blood of Jesus but
1:05:53
also to surrender your whole life and make sacrifice to
1:06:00
God making a sacrifice for this specific area a real sacrifice releases this
1:06:08
demonic reaping releases this curse amen it's just the same principle that
1:06:15
we just learned about through through the Bible how the hand of God the power of
1:06:21
God comes in certain cases after the
1:06:26
sacrifice and sometimes it can be if you maybe witchcraft wasn't done to you maybe it wasn't deep generational curses
1:06:33
but maybe you have swn into the kingdom of darkness you've gone to uh psychics
1:06:39
you paid tons of money to psychics you've given so much money to
1:06:46
psychics you've swed into the Demonic Kingdom and that's reaped so much demonic bondage and not just any kind of
1:06:53
demon any kind of a demonic bondage but it's attached to this sacrifice you made it's different than just watching a
1:06:59
horror movie you actually put your money to these psychics you see how it's
1:07:06
deeper and so in these cases the sacrifice is what lifts that off of you the sacrifice into the kingdom of
1:07:14
God and we should want that we should feel convicted if you have given tons of money to the Demonic Kingdom whether
1:07:21
it's psychics whether it's um witches to receive healing from them
1:07:28
healers whether it's new age stuff you've gone to new AG
1:07:33
iasa that stuff you've you've paid money for new age conferences or
1:07:39
whatever you you should feel convicted even I've given so much money that God
1:07:45
gave me and blessed me with there I must give the same amount and more that I've given there to
1:07:52
God you you should feel in your heart inded
1:08:00
in that area you know what I mean I mean it's true like you you're you're you're
1:08:05
saved your your sins are gone but you you should feel I want to I
1:08:13
don't want to just accept Jesus freely I want to make sacrifice and Thanksgiving
1:08:19
and give to God cuz he deserves it now I just want to
1:08:24
not do anything you know you should feel like conviction amen not that you have to
1:08:32
you're not forced to do that but you should feel conviction and if you could just have that conviction and give your
1:08:37
everything you won't even get to this place where you're still stuck in bondage the spiritual laws know what you
1:08:44
have sowed and you will be released if this is what's holding you
1:08:49
back from complete Freedom as you continue to sew into the kingdom of God the the laws know the spiritual laws
1:08:55
they know when it's been paid paid in this we can say paid Jesus
1:09:02
Paid It All amen but we can't use that as an excuse to not sew into God's
1:09:09
kingdom amen
1:09:18
hallelujah so sometimes this can come as a prophetic word for a person
1:09:24
sometimes in the middle of Deliverance someone who is Anointed who hear is hearing from God who has a prophetic
1:09:31
anointing God will reveal to them this person the the the key that's unlocking
1:09:38
them is to sew into the kingdom of God and we should we should be humble
1:09:45
and receive this Hallelujah I received Direction the devil is able
1:09:50
to keep so many people in the church in bondage because there's just so much
1:09:56
complaint so many complainers that don't want to follow instructions from God but
1:10:02
the the the people in the kingdom of darkness they're all they're all ready to follow instructions they're all ready to make sacrifices they take it
1:10:09
seriously but the people in the church many times are just
1:10:14
complainers we got to take god seriously amen receive the prophetic instruction
1:10:21
be humble and also sometimes it might not come from a prophetic instruction sometimes you'll feel convicted
1:10:27
yourself sometimes you can know man I've had there's so much witchcraft that I've done or that's been in my past and my
1:10:35
family I need to sew into the kingdom of God I need to
1:10:41
make sacrifice there's so much demonic reaping in my life I need to sew into
1:10:47
the kingdom of God to get all this reaping out sometimes the conviction will come to you for many of you what's
1:10:53
coming to you now your eyes are opening up seeing that this has held you back
1:10:59
that this is the key amen
1:11:04
hallelujah thank you Jesus I remember one time um I ministered a couple years
1:11:11
ago now it was almost two years ago in January I was ministering in Houston Revival is now and this woman brought
1:11:19
her young son like eight or nine years old I would say and um she said to me she says I've been
1:11:27
to Deliverance Minister after Deliverance Minister and the demons aren't leaving
1:11:33
him they're praying for him but he just manifests he just keeps on manifesting and they don't ever leave
1:11:40
him this is not just going to any old church this is going to Deliverance
1:11:46
Ministries and so she says this to me I pray over the boy and as I pray over the boy and I see
1:11:53
him still manifesting God reveals to me God speaks to
1:11:59
me that this is deeper demonic
1:12:05
bondage all of a sudden he God speaks to me like prophetically he revealed to me
1:12:10
that she had sewed into psychics given to psychics so I just
1:12:16
asked her I say did you happen to go to psychics yeah did you give money to the
1:12:22
psychic she said yeah I say like a lot she says like hundreds and hundreds and God revealed to me right
1:12:29
there this is the key that is unlock going to unlock freedom for her son
1:12:34
because this is generational it got passed down to her son for her to sew into the kingdom of
1:12:40
God and I just told her that and I and I told her to sew into the kingdom of God
1:12:46
to where God's power is it's not about giving to a minister or something it's about the principle of sewing into God's
1:12:52
Kingdom where his anointing is and so I just left her with that
1:12:58
instruction just I gave her Free Will I didn't say are you going to do it I just I just shared that with her this key and
1:13:05
then I moved on there were so many people manifesting Deliverance everywhere was happening so I go on praying for other
1:13:12
people and all of a sudden she she runs to me Apostle Catherine and she's standing here with
1:13:18
her boy he was laying on the ground before manifesting demons speaking out of him laughing through him he's
1:13:23
standing here and full of Peace looking and she says he's set free he says she
1:13:32
says I I just pulled up on my phone push pay for five-fold church and I just
1:13:37
immediately sewed right there and she goes right after I did that he started I
1:13:43
believe it was coughing up demons and then he was set
1:13:49
free praise God praise
1:13:55
God and she was just overjoyed and the boy was full of peace and joy and then
1:14:01
even they came back the next day there was a two-day event they came back the next day and testified and he
1:14:08
was just being a normal kid no manifesting and she was just so
1:14:13
Overjoyed she traveled far to be here so desperate for Freedom they tried so many
1:14:19
other things they tried so many other Deliverance Ministry many many people don't have this
1:14:25
Revelation and it's rejected many times because it's new wine it's it's rare and
1:14:31
anything that's new new wine is seen as weird and wrong because it's so rare
1:14:38
obscure but this is what brought freedom to her son amen and so I am proud of my
1:14:45
Jesus I'm proud of him I'm not ashamed of him I'm not ashamed of his anointing I'm
1:14:53
not ashamed of the power of God that brings salvation deliverance and healing
1:14:59
to old children of God and young children of God alike I am not ashamed
1:15:05
of how the Holy Spirit works and his principles I'm not ashamed of the principle of sewing and
1:15:11
reaping it's not uncomfortable for me to talk about sewing because I know the power that it is that this principle is
1:15:19
going to unlock people from bondage from lack
1:15:25
I'm not ashamed I'm not ashamed of God's new wine I'm not ashamed of his precious
1:15:31
Keys prophetic keys that unlocks his people I'm not ashamed no matter what
1:15:37
religious Spirits people want to say I'm not ashamed will you be unashamed with
1:15:42
me amen hallelujah
1:15:49
hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and it's not just been that testimony of that little boy
1:15:55
there's been so many people who have written to me many I've shared on my social media how God was urging them to
1:16:02
sew uh they were stuck in bondage for a long time God was urging them to sew and
1:16:08
they SED and they were free after they SED amen hallelujah so simply put when you
1:16:16
seow you're sewing when you're sewing into where God's true kingdom is his anointing you're sewing into that
1:16:22
anointing so what do you reaping the anointing it's very simple and the Bible talks about we read
1:16:28
all these scriptures about I will pour out blessings I will pour out blessings I will give you
1:16:34
protection his anointing it's his anointing the blessings are his anointing his
1:16:40
power his protection is his power his Supernatural power and so simply put
1:16:45
whenever you seow you are sewing into the anointing to release what you need
1:16:54
whether it's provision whether it's physical blessings spiritual blessings
1:17:00
Deliverance you are raping that simply amen so sew into the anointing
1:17:08
