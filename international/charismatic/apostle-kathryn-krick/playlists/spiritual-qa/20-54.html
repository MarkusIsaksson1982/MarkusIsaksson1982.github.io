0:00
is it only up to us how much our spiritual eyes open like when we are
0:05
planted or does God choose when to reveal certain things well it's definitely both definitely both
0:14
because well when it comes to everything in the spiritual realm he he doesn't
0:19
reveal every little detail and every little thing going on to everybody um
0:25
well when we're talking about uh SE deeply in the spiritual realm the
0:33
office of the Prophet has this um Authority has this grace and just this Authority given by
0:41
God to look and see what's going on in in the spiritual realm so like for
0:47
example if um someone is wondering you
0:52
know what I'm I'm I'm having so much uh of an issue in this area you
1:00
know a prophet can really see and see the past and see what's going on what's
1:05
going on spiritually um and can see what's going on spiritually but also
1:11
just things that are happening you can't lie to a prophet and then Apostles carry
1:19
prophetic anointing and so prophetic anointing comes upon a person a a minister when God
1:28
wants to reveal something to them so if there's like an issue if it's if it's
1:33
like ministering to someone God will make the prophetic anointing come on
1:39
like a like a coat basically like coming on so now like what the prophet sees the
1:47
minister can see to deal with a specific spiritual issue so you can't lie um you
1:54
know with this true prophetic anointing upon ministers and then God gives
2:00
prophetic giftings to all believers um but that's according to his choosing so
2:06
maybe when someone just needs encouragement and God wants to just use
2:12
you in the prophetic anointing not not meaning that it may be all of these
2:17
details like I see this and I see this but just the the prophetic anointing may
2:23
come upon you and move you you might you may see something uh you might notice
2:28
something about someone like how this person is just such a light and
2:35
um that just God has such a great purpose for their lives now of course that's true for everybody but it could
2:42
be on that day that they really needed to hear that and they're going through things they're going through attacks
2:48
that said otherwise and you could just have this strong feeling like this God's
2:54
going to do great things with this person's life like they God has such great plans for them so without going to
3:00
into the territory of prophesying directional things when that isn't what your calling is and things that are um
3:09
just stepping into that office of a prophet God the prophetic anointing can still come upon a Believer to nudge them
3:16
move them put a pull on their heart to encourage somebody um
3:23
so all that to say um in terms of what God reveals when it's the prophetic
3:29
those are the differences and then when it comes to just like understanding things in the
3:35
spiritual realm understanding principles understanding different aspects of the
3:42
Kingdom um having that Revelation having your eyes to really see and understand
3:48
um it it's both both up to the person to Humble themselves the more they will
3:53
humble themselves and be teachable and just receive the word like receive the
3:59
word that released as truth the word that's preached the word that's taught
4:04
receiving that as truth the more they do that childlike humble
4:09
teachable that's the action of Allowing God to open their eyes give them true
4:15
understanding but at the same time so then the second part is um it's not that if you just humble
4:22
yourself you all of a sudden God just shows you everything he he
4:28
knows how to reveal things to you the timing to reveal things to you the speed at which to reveal things to you
4:35
sometimes we can be so eager to know so many different things so many different Mysteries of the Kingdom so many deep
4:42
things about the kingdom but God just doesn't need us to know that quite yet certain aspect of the Kingdom maybe um
4:50
maybe about angels for example maybe you know we're so curious and we want our eyes open up about that that area of the
4:58
spiritual Realm but God doesn't need us to focus on that right now actually he wants us to focus
5:03
on something else that's going to help us spiritually right now where this thing isn't really applying to our
5:11
current spiritual situation Health growth right now so you know it's both
5:18
it's what God chooses to release and reveal and if you will be humble to
5:24
allow him to open your eyes how to handle coming back home from
5:29
a life-changing event like flourish to a family that does that doesn't accept who
5:34
you have become well when we become more like
5:40
Jesus and the more we surrender we're going to have a lot of people that don't like that in our lives
5:47
some people that don't like that don't agree with that it's going to be part of it because Jesus says the world hated me
5:54
the world will hate you so the world meaning people in the world it it
6:00
it just meaning people who are not on the same page who are not equally yolked who are not fully surrendered to
6:07
God they may feel hate that's that's the influence of the enemy because the enemy
6:14
hates Jesus so the more that you're shining Jesus and being more like Jesus
6:19
and more surrendered to Jesus so he can use you even more um it's going to make the enemy
6:25
dislike you more and so if anybody has any kind of open door to the enemy
6:32
they're susceptible to being used by the enemy and that's how that's what's that's what's happening that's the the
6:38
spiritual reality that's happening when you're sensing that when you're noticing hatred and people just being
6:44
mean to you for no reason when you're actually more in God's will than ever so just first of all to have that
6:51
understanding that's just part of our Lives as Believers that's part of the persecution it's part of the refining
6:57
fire that we go through that God uses for good so um just don't let it get to you
7:05
don't let it bother you renew your mind of the spiritual truth that this is just a sign that You' become more like Jesus
7:12
and you're making the enemy mad so you're right on track you're making Jesus proud and um your true family is your
7:21
family in Christ that's your truest family so um know that you're not alone
7:26
you do have family even if your biological family isn't acting like
7:33
family like they should as family don't take it so personally and feel so hurt
7:39
like that you feel alone or something you have family you are loved and God is
7:48
going to bring more and more family to you as you obey him the more you obey
7:55
him the more he can entrust you with really pre precious hearts that are
8:00
truly surrendered to God and the people that are surrendered to God are going to be the most amazing family most amazing
8:08
friends in the whole world because they're like God they're Godly so they they they have the love of
8:15
Christ flowing through them and and touching you so this is the reward of surrendering
8:22
everything the reward of even having your going through the hard thing of
8:27
having family not understand you or treat you wrong or not like
8:34
you so encourage yourself in the Lord and renew your mind and keep going keep
8:44
doing what you're doing keep being obedient to Jesus he's so
8:50
proud on Sunday you spoke about when another Christians speak skepticism to
8:55
the message you have received does it always have to deplete our soil or can we reject it oh no it doesn't always
9:02
have to deplete your soil so yeah there's an example that I gave on Sunday that we're referring to right now that I believe hopefully all of you have seen
9:08
it or most of you if not go watch it from this past Sunday um called fruit of
9:14
the believer and um in this message I I gave the example of the scripture Luke
9:19
13:6 then he began telling them this Parable a certain man had a fig tree that had been planted in his Vineyard
9:25
and he came looking for fruit on it but did not find any so he said to the vine keeper for 3 years I have been looking for fruit on this fig tree and have
9:31
found none cut it down why does it even use up the ground depleting the soil and blocking the
9:37
sunlight um so I'm just going to stop right there so this is where the verse she's referring to so I was sharing how
9:44
um there can be people in the church that are depleting the soil and blocking the sunlight depleting the soil meaning
9:51
[Music] um depleting the soil and and and
9:56
blocking the sunlight meaning well depleting the soil meaning bringing poison bringing words contrary to what
10:02
God has spoken and just going going against what God is doing here at the
10:09
church um and then blocking the sunlight would is like blocking the anointing um
10:15
so I was sharing how there can be Believers that are not surrendered to God that have opened doors to the enemy
10:22
but are in the church and they can be depleting soil and blocking the sunlight meaning they so here's here one of the
10:29
examples I gave like for example if another one person was to like speak skepticism towards the message that was
10:35
just released that was the spiritual food that God wanted the Believers to have but maybe after the message for
10:42
example um another person in the church just starts speaking skepticism about
10:48
the message maybe they're coming with old wine and religion and how that could deplete the soil like poison what they have received
10:55
so this question is is the soil always depleted um or or not so no this is up to you
11:03
it's up to the maturity of the believer so this is this is the importance that we become strong in the Lord that we
11:09
take our spiritual growth seriously because you know when we are first a baby babies can't fight for themselves
11:17
right they're very vulnerable but as a baby grows into
11:23
adulthood now it's so different instead of a baby laying on the street a person
11:28
can stand on the street can walk on the street can defend themselves like you know has a phone to call for help if
11:36
that's needed you know when if a baby's left on this street that's like really scary like the
11:43
most vulnerable position ever but if you as an adult are standing on the street
11:49
that's not scary at all that's not vulnerable at all that's normal right so that's how it is in the spiritual realm
11:55
if we are being lazy with our spiritual growth not taking it seriously it's like like we're a baby on the
12:01
street we're very vulnerable so you want to make sure that you're not vulnerable
12:06
and how do you make sure you're not vulnerable take your spiritual growth seriously you know um don't miss a
12:12
Sunday don't miss a teaching and value the teachings and uh um take notes and
12:18
meditate on them and apply them and be in the word every day and make sure you're keeping doors shut to the devil
12:25
Take Your Surrender and obedience seriously that's how you make sure you're growing okay and so
12:34
um it doesn't matter what the devil's trying to do whether it's outside the
12:39
church or or in somebody through somebody in the church it doesn't matter what he's trying to do it doesn't have
12:47
to affect you it doesn't have to deplete the soil or block the sunlight but you
12:53
do have to go in the spirit and reject the devil's lies and and be strong in
13:00
the Lord and renew your mind you do need to have gotten this growth to be able to
13:07
have this wisdom and spiritual understanding your eyes open up right so
13:12
when you hear somebody say something you automatic if it's from the enemy you
13:18
automatically can see ah I see what's going on here this is the enemy I reject that that's not going to enter me one
13:24
bit you know rather than letting it bother you and question questioning it
13:30
and is there truth to it things like this that's when when that's happening
13:36
it's like there's not the growth that's needed to make sure that you're not like
13:42
vulnerable you know so um you know in my message I was sharing this is serious
13:48
for the church because I mean it's serious that everybody sees the
13:55
responsibility in themselves of bearing fruit and not depleting the soil and
14:01
blocking the sunlight because you can be causing damage to others and the damage to others I'm
14:07
speaking about is and it can be you
14:12
know many times it could be to to those who are young in the faith or those who were
14:18
vulnerable right so it's not a guarantee that everyone's soil is depleted if um
14:25
the enemy is trying to attack in some way no no no no no um it's just there could be vulnerable
14:34
ones that that are there that that that that could have the soil
14:41
depleted right but God can restore of course always anything that's lost or
14:47
any way the devil affected somebody should we wear 5f merch even if we don't always have joy so as to not represent
14:53
Jesus wrongly well you should not declare that you
14:59
don't have joy say I have the joy of the Lord it's not about feeling and um you know you should
15:06
what's more important is to be obeying God first and foremost to obeying God
15:12
meaning it to to be a light to the world it doesn't mean you have to be
15:18
like this everywhere you go and like saying hi hi hi hi to everyone like you
15:24
can just mind your business and go on the subway or whatever and just be on
15:30
your phone sometimes checking emails or writing notes you know of reminders and
15:38
reading your Bible app you know you can be on this public transportation or something like looking at your phone you
15:45
don't need to feel like every time you're in public like you know you're representing
15:51
God wrongly no like you can you can go about your life and relax and but be at
15:58
this same time be open and ready for Holy Spirit to lead you to smile at
16:05
someone um or strike up a conversation with someone you know but
16:12
um you know you can be putting too much burden on burden on yourself sometimes if you think that it's this hard work to
16:20
represent God rightly every day um when you have the Holy Spirit it it doesn't
16:26
need to be hard or heavy it shouldn't be hard or heavy you know this is obedience
16:32
to God to allow him to use you however he wants each day and sometimes it can
16:39
be just one tiny little seed it doesn't mean it's like this top this tiring task
16:47
from morning to night you know what I mean I mean sometimes maybe you just you just go to work and you're just you know
16:53
you're busy doing your job at work and you were just Pleasant to everyone
16:59
and you know you were just Pleasant and kind to
17:04
them if they had any questions but it's work so maybe there's not time to like
17:09
have conversations with people and evangelize but that's okay like when it's work and you have to be doing your
17:15
job 9 to5 like you don't need to feel like this heaviness like I have to represent God rightly when you have the
17:21
Holy Spirit you can just you have everything you need you can be kind when when people approach you um um you can
17:29
smile at them um you know you can have the restraint to respond negatively you
17:36
can have the self-control because you have the Holy Spirit if someone treats you wrongly and
17:44
um you can also be open to Holy Spirit asking you to do more in a certain
17:49
situation so I just want to share like every day you you need you we don't have
17:55
days off so you know we don't have days off of of being a child of God being
18:00
surrendered to God being obedient to God so I want that to be in your heart first before like wearing five F merch and
18:07
representing F we need to make sure we're representing Jesus every day rightly but don't feel like this is
18:13
heavy if if you wake up not feeling Joy you you can change that you can go to
18:19
Jesus and renew your mind you don't have to let that feeling dictate your day and
18:25
say oh this is just my off day no you can in this is what God wants you to do to go in the spiritual real renew your
18:31
mind go to Jesus and um and and and come where his
18:37
anointing is Flowing on the way to work or something if you're not feeling Joy naturally turn on one of these videos
18:44
and let the anointing touch you and the Holy Spirit energize you and bring you peace and joy and strength
18:52
amen when someone always wants to talk to you but you need your space is it okay to have space or always be there
18:58
for them yes you are not God and if someone wants you to always be there for
19:04
them and always be listening you are taking the place of God so you need to know this is not your
19:11
responsibility and um there will be very few people that
19:17
God calls you to really just always be there for you don't have the capacity
19:22
for that um and I know I shared last week I know I talked a lot about the
19:29
importance of only bringing the whom God was calling you to bring in close close
19:35
how it can be very damaging if you're bringing the wrong people in close and
19:40
um there are some people that you know they just it's it's how they feel love is
19:48
being heard and just talking and talking and talking and being heard when it's like they're trying to fill a void in
19:54
that way rather than Allowing God to fill that void that's one of the things sometimes um
20:03
other times some people can just like be
20:08
selfishly taking someone's time you know and just kind of thinking about themsel and um there's some people that
20:15
can just be socially unaware of this so it's different Dynamics like there can
20:20
be people who just don't care and are selfishly um taking taking so much time
20:28
we only have a certain amount of time in each day and it's not right to you
20:35
know expect someone to take hours or one hour every day or something or several
20:41
days a week just to listen you know um May there's times when people are going
20:46
through hard things and that's different but I'm talking about just on a normal basis um it's it's not right it's
20:55
not acceptable it's not acceptable able like in the kingdom of God but also like
21:02
socially like these are just general boundaries we just we're we're only human we only have a certain amount of
21:07
time in each day and we all have we all have responsibilities we all have jobs
21:13
some people have children we all some people have marriages we all need for as
21:18
Christians we all need to take personal time to be with God and we all need to serve God and we all need to take time
21:26
to relax and rest and we all need to take time to eat and we all need to take time to exercise and
21:32
we all need to take time to sleep that's all in one day so um yeah there's some people that
21:40
like selfishly knowingly are are trying
21:46
to steal time from people I should say um and then there's some people that just it's like socially they're
21:52
unaware you know um in their mind they're just not having that awareness but with all of that you need to make
21:59
sure you're protecting your peace and you're protecting your relationship with God and you're
22:04
protecting everything all your responsibilities that God's calling you to do like if you know you have to take
22:10
care of your children and be loving to your children if you know you need to be loving to your spouse and help your
22:17
spouse with things sometimes and spend time with them if you know you need to clean the house if you know you need to
22:23
serve God if you know you need to show up to work on time and with energy if you know that all these things God is
22:29
calling you to that this is obedience to God you that you know that God's calling you to eat eat that you know that God's
22:35
calling you to work out that you know that God's calling you to sleep you better make sure you're doing all these things right you need to like um make a
22:44
list you know you need to take inventory like what is God calling me to do you
22:50
know and getting a good dead sleep God's calling you to do that you know these seriously these things is OB these
22:56
things are obedience to God okay and you need to make sure you're doing these things um that's not to be
23:04
religious I mean if the plane takes off at 6:00 a.m. and
23:10
it's quite difficult to go to sleep by 8:00 p.m. to get or 700 p.m. to get some
23:17
good sleep I don't mean it in a religious way but I think you know what I'm trying to say what I'm saying in a
23:22
general way you need to like see all the things that God is calling you to do and
23:28
not discount them just because they don't seem that spiritual because sometimes like listening to someone
23:35
again and again and you know that can seem more spiritual than you taking care
23:40
of yourself for example or you taking care of your kids and your marriage things like that all right so um you
23:48
need to see what God is calling you to prioritize and you need to really walk in wisdom because sure there can be
23:56
sometimes a holy spirit is calling you to be there for someone and listen to them um and encourage them but it's not
24:03
going to be like every single day unless you're a pastor or a counselor or
24:09
something you know like that kind of capacity what a certain person may be wanting so um you know you got to take
24:17
it you got to take what God you need to Value what God has called you to do and
24:23
not let someone just intrude on that um
24:29
and and take you away from what God's called you to do so walk in that wisdom
24:35
and just walk in that wisdom with awareness knowing the different dynamics of how some there will be people who
24:40
will try to take advantage there will also be people who just don't know better but still there has to be boundaries that are put up if one
24:47
doesn't believe in generational curses can they ever be free from them or does that belief have to be established
24:55
first it really depends um I've shared this before with there's a certain
25:01
message on the secret of the anointing playlist um there's a message called um
25:09
I think it's how to cast out demons either part one or part two I forget which one but I do remember teaching on
25:15
this specifically that there's a key to receiving
25:21
Deliverance of of Faith um but it depends depends it's not
25:28
like if you don't believe uh you you can't be set free
25:35
it's not like that um God is not legalistic when you see Jesus
25:41
ministering in the gospels people are coming to him people are coming I mean they're coming they're
25:49
coming to the services where he's ministering The Gatherings they're coming not like
25:54
because I've made Jesus my Lord and now I'm going to go to church like most of
25:59
them didn't know about Jesus much um a lot of them were coming out of
26:06
curiosity but a lot of them were coming with
26:12
openness not skepticism right the Pharisees would go to the meetings too but they came with
26:19
skepticism and so they weren't receiving Freedom salvation the
26:25
anointing but those who are coming curious maybe there wasn't a true belief
26:32
there Faith but openness right and then maybe they start
26:37
to to to to see Jesus do a miracle and maybe that openness opens up even more
26:43
it's like a mustard seed of Faith the lack of skepticism and openness can be like a mustard seed of Faith type thing
26:51
um and so you know so many people that are being set free and Jesus is setting
26:57
them free and then they're coming to the faith then they're believing the demonstration of God's power revealed
27:04
his love to them and that's what made them to believe um I remember just when I opened
27:11
myself to believe um in God's power and then I received the baptis of the Holy Spirit
27:17
and that's what moved me to surrender but it was you know encountering God's power is
27:23
what led to the full faith happening so um
27:29
yeah so like Jesus has this grace that and he understands that you need to meet him you need to encounter his power
27:36
before you believe before you believe before you really believe many times so there's not this security guard at the
27:44
door of the church that's like do you believe in Jesus if you don't then
27:50
you're not allowed to come in here and receive Deliverance no this is how Jesus reveals himself so
27:58
um with the generational curses it really it depends it's it's based on just what I shared right there right so
28:04
if someone has been indoctrinated for so long like about the topic of generational curses so maybe they're
28:10
just like yeah I don't think generational curses they're broken already like maybe they're coming like
28:16
that but they're not coming like skeptical right so maybe you know they come really not believing about
28:22
generational curses the truth in them but at the same time they're not like skeptical like a Pharisee they're not
28:28
coming to the church let's say they're not coming to the church like five of church they're not coming like H they
28:34
believe crazy things here like generational curses um exist today I'm
28:40
coming to see what's going on here like they probably won't be free of the
28:45
generational curse on that day but if if if if they're not like
28:51
just full of all that skepticism but just tons of people told them generational CSS don't exist God has
28:58
Grace you know if you can just be open childlike humble
29:03
teachable anything's possible God's grace is there so there can be someone
29:08
that um came into the church not believing the generational curses are real but then they start to encounter God's power and maybe I declare over
29:15
them for example I break this generational curse and it's broken and they realize right there oh wow this was
29:22
real there really was a generational curse on my life These are this is true when are we deceived by the angel of
29:28
Light or just have lack of
29:34
knowledge so when you have a lack of knowledge it's going to be way easier to be
29:39
deceived by the angel of Light and good meaning people can be deceived by the angel of
29:46
Light um like for example if they didn't have someone to they didn't have a
29:52
anointed teacher to help hear to help them help teach them how to hear the voice of God and God's principles
30:00
because the big way that the angel of Light comes is like there's this voice in the head there's this
30:07
voice or there's this this feeling and he just tries to masquerade himself as
30:12
the Holy Spirit and it can be doing like Godly things and
30:17
so a lot of people can easily be deceived by the angel of Light but once you have knowledge about how to hear the
30:25
voice of God which I've done teachings about I have them on my YouTube um but
30:31
one of the big ones is that for any like directional
30:39
things major different directional things it should really be you need to
30:45
make sure it's aligning with the word that's coming forth through your spiritual leader it shouldn't go outside
30:52
the boundaries um so
30:58
like there's so there's many people that are just saying God told me this God told me this and it's
31:03
like it's so much um it's like God isn't
31:09
speaking this this this this all the time it's following the
31:14
holy spirit is more simple and um in general I just want to share so many
31:21
times that's that's a sign of the angel of Light um also when someone's so
31:27
certain and um this and then this and then this and then this and it's
31:32
like it's just God generally doesn't speak in an audible voice um to to to people that
31:41
much he comes in a still Small Voice Hallelujah so so much of our day
31:47
will look like spending time in his word because he's told us too not like an
31:54
audible voice saying go to the Bible right now but it's so much of hearing a fallen the holy spirit
32:01
is um wisdom is wisdom is in obedience
32:06
to God's word so it's like many people are like God should I read the Bible right now or instead should I have
32:12
breakfast first and it's you know and at the same time God made us in His image
32:18
to make choices so some things it's not so strict like that like um well if if
32:27
you feel like eating breakfast first is making food an idol if that's how
32:33
you're feeling then read the Bible first but if you're not feeling that way and it's you en
32:39
you it's fine to have breakfast first then read the Bible this is just an example but there's some lots of times
32:46
people are saying oh God told me to wear this blue shirt God told me to wear these black shoes and God told me to do
32:51
this and God told me to do this and and it's they're really hearing some sort of voice but it's not the Holy Spirit
32:59
um I'm just giving you example of some wisdom that's released through spiritual
33:06
leaders like how I've shared that helps you really know how to hear the Holy Spirit and not be deceived by just any
33:13
voice going on in the in your head okay so the knowledge is very important but
33:19
once you've gained the knowledge if you are humble you shouldn't be deceived by the angel of
33:25
Light you you have the equipping have the wisdom you know you have that and
33:31
you have the Holy Spirit but if there is
33:38
pride it almost always the angel of Light comes and
33:44
that's that's how people are deceived the most by the angel of Light if there is
33:49
pride if there's pride in hearing God's voice God doesn't want God wants us to be confident that we hear him and are
33:56
led by him but we're not supposed to be prideful in hearing God's voice especially because God has certain ways
34:03
that he speaks one of the really big ways he speaks is through leaders Through Your
34:08
Leader um and also God has principles so he doesn't go outside of his principles
34:15
so if God's principles of this is his order but then all of a sudden God says no or someone says no God told me to do
34:21
this but it's out of order God for sure did not say that that was 100% the angel of Light you know um so anyways because
34:31
God speaks through leaders God is one of the big ways God speaks um through his
34:36
principles like they it has you can't go outside of the principles
34:42
um you you have to be humble for hearing God's voice right because there's some people that are
34:48
prideful with hearing God's voice and they're like they just feel like they don't need anyone
34:54
else they don't need God's principles order they don't need spiritual leaders
34:59
they don't need spiritual leaders to hear the voice of God they're just good with them and God you know um that's
35:05
Pride so we're called to be humble in the area of hearing God's voice you know I I ask my spiritual father questions
35:12
for wisdom sometimes I'm not I'm not like oh I'm this great Apostle so I can
35:18
just ask God directly you know this is just an example like I know that God
35:23
literally speaks to me through my spiritual father for several things
35:28
and that requires humility it requires humility sometimes it would be way easier and quicker to just have God
35:36
speak it to me directly certain things you know so it takes humility it takes
35:43
humility um to really hear God's voice to really hear God's voice because he
35:49
sets it up this way he sets it up this way that his that hearing his voice requires humility requires humility
35:58
so um when you are truly humble you won't be deceived by the angel of Light
36:04
you'll have the nudging of the Holy Spirit if something if something seems off or you have a question about this
36:09
maybe if it's like something something someone told you like God said this and you'll be
36:14
like H this something seems off about this you know that's because you're humble
36:22
and you have the Holy Spirit nudging you this could be an angel of Light situation here you know
36:30
um and and when you're humble you you
36:35
that's the safest place to be that's the safest place to be when you're humble um
36:41
God can't let you be deceived you know when you're humble he will reveal to you
36:48
Hallelujah so when you're humble you'll you'll seek God's voice not in your own
36:53
way but in God's way of how he wants you to seek and then you will find then you will find him
36:59
speaking but when you find um the most
37:04
whenever someone's in Pride and they're a Christian pretty much always they're
37:09
going to be led by the angel of Light because it's like the devil is
37:15
trying to make them confident in what they're doing in their
37:21
actions so the devil will come sounding Godly and even though deep down the
37:28
person should be convicted you know they're going out of order or um there's pride in the heart it's like
37:36
many times they'll just go right to this comforting voice of the angel of
37:44
Light and tell themselves it's the voice of God yes being
37:51
humble humility living a life of humility is the safest place to be
37:58
oh I I like that that statement a lot
38:04
it's so true I'm telling you it's so true like I it I'm telling you I
38:11
like I've never felt so safe um in my life the past eight
38:17
years spiritually physically but it's because of doing
38:24
things God's way and humbling
38:29
myself so that I'm submitting to Authority my under my
38:34
spiritual father I'm I'm humbling myself to to hear the wisdom and ask questions
38:41
and not do what I think is best you know it's it's so true if you
38:48
can humble yourself you don't ever need to fear fear anything you know being taken
38:54
out of God's will or being deceived or because God is so good I mean God is so
39:02
good he he loves you so much he wants you to be safe more than you want to be
39:07
safe he want he he wants to make sure you're not deceived even more than you want to make sure
39:13
that but it's up to you to give him permission to to protect you and that is
39:19
humility because that's where that's the key of hearing God's voice that's the key of your spiritual eyes opening up as
39:26
when the disciples return back from casting out demons Jesus said father I thank you for hiding these things from
39:32
the the prideful and only revealing it to those who are childlike so he's speaking on spiritual eyes opening up
39:39
he's speaking about the deeper things of the spiritual realm he's speaking about
39:45
Revelation humility is
39:50
everything I also want to mention it's so important to be humble like in all ways and also in the air of hearing
39:56
God's voice cuz I [Music]
40:02
mean I I I think we can all I think every person can say we've been wrong about hearing God's voice in some area
40:09
we were we thought it was this was a certain way but we were we were wrong right and we know coming from the old
40:17
wine everything was old wine you know I mean so much of the doctrine all in a
40:23
lot of cases all of the doctrine for a lot of people is old wine um you know missing missing the
40:31
spiritual principles the ways of God and missing like the deeper things
40:39
in the spirit like how the devil works like how he works through the
40:45
angel of Light you know so when you come to into the new
40:52
wine you can't just be humble in one area you can't be just like oh yeah I
40:57
don't know much about Deliverance so I humble myself and I become teachable in this area you have to become teachable
41:04
in every area and so um you might have
41:09
taught yourself how to hear God and there could be some wrong things
41:15
there if you didn't have an anointed spiritual leader to help you understand how to hear God's
41:22
voice and operate in order and the principles of God that and in most cases
41:29
probably the angel of Light took advantage of that situation and many times people thought they heard the
41:34
voice of God just based on feeling and a thought that comes to the head as long
41:39
as it sounds good must be God you know as long as it sounds like something spiritual must be a God you know people
41:47
have taught themselves how to hear the voice of God and that's created problems like it's they've now been years in
41:55
following these voices following these thoughts so when you come into this new
42:01
wine you have to be teachable in this area and and and humble yourself like I
42:06
might have been wrong I might have been thinking I was hearing from God um with
42:11
in this situation and this situation for these years but actually was the angel of Light that requires
42:16
humility that's the only way that God can open your eyes and reveal to you
42:23
this way you thought of hearing God was wrong this is really how to hear my voice
42:30
amen and just just another reminder I believe that you could type in on YouTube how to hear God's voice I
42:38
believe um I think it's probably on the Revival Army train Revival army training
42:44
playlist as well on YouTube I think I declare any area of confusion
42:52
any area just bringing heaviness spiritually mentally in you must go now
42:59
in jesus' name I declare any kind of hurt that's come upon you um heaviness
43:06
of disappointment heaviness of um just
43:12
betrayals I declare this hurt to be removed your heart to be healed in
43:17
jesus' name and I declare any kind of demonic Spirit must leave now and I
43:24
declare any kind of sickness or pain I speak healing to you now in Jesus
43:30
name and thank you Jesus thank you Jesus and I release this anointing upon you
43:38
and I declare wisdom to increase in Jesus name
43:44
I declare your spiritual eyes to open up more and let humility increase so
43:53
much may you be humble every day and may with May with that humility May there be
44:00
Revelation released eyes opened up more understanding in jesus'
44:05
name thank you Jesus thank you Lord and I declare to anyone who renounced Spirit
44:12
of Pride I declare it to leave you oh Spirit of Pride to go in jesus'
44:19
name and I speak the fire of the Holy Spirit to come upon you and fill you
44:24
with God's peace and joy and his love in Jesus
44:30
name thank you Jesus Hallelujah
