what does it look like to love people how do we love people the right way like Jesus did not being manipulated and not
0:08
pleasing people um wow well that's a big question let me let me
0:16
start with this what does it look like to love people so um first of all this
0:21
looks like realizing this call that God has given us the the second greatest
0:28
commandment which is to love his people and um we have to make that decision to
0:37
love everyone to love our enemies to love our friends to love our family to
0:44
love everyone we've ever known in our life personally no matter what they've done to us and to
0:51
love all of the strangers all the people that we've never met and will never meet
0:58
God is actually asking asking us to love them all um we obviously cannot have
1:05
relationship with them all only God can do that and um how we
1:12
love people we have it will look different like we have different callings for of how to love people uh I
1:21
mean different groups of people obviously people that we've never met we cannot have relationship with
1:27
them we cannot communicate with them we can't give them a hug we can't encourage
1:33
them in the word of the Lord one onone but you can love the entire world
1:40
like all the people you've never met by using your platform using your platform
1:48
on social media to shine a light social media is such an amazing gift and tool
1:53
it's like God has really given us access to reach the whole world um and you
2:00
don't have to have a huge following to reach millions of people
2:07
like there's so many of you who have shared testimonies and I share them to my page
2:15
and as I've shared them to my page Millions have been reached M um you know
2:21
this this past uh live on Wednesday there was th
2:28
this this man from um Philippines and he had in his heart I
2:35
really want to share my testimony I loved that not that it was um wrong to write in the comments you
2:42
know I need freedom from this that was right I was actually asking you to do that but it's like he had love in his
2:48
heart for other people to be able to receive what he received that he wrote in the comments I hope I can share my
2:55
testimony and I saw that comment and I the Holy Spirit Led me like call on this
3:00
person they need to share their testimony for other people to hear because other people are going to receive salvation and deliverance and
3:06
healing as they hear this testimony and so I called him on the live and he shared his testimony and you could just
3:12
hear and is it was so precious you could just he hear he after he spoke his testimony passionately about how he's
3:18
delivered of tourettes of seizures of schizophrenia of um mental illness after
3:27
he was delivered of all those things um after he's sharing that about how he was just
3:33
watching a a a zoom live that I was doing and it wasn't 101 prayer after that he he then says you guys listening
3:41
it doesn't have to be oneon-one prayer God can touch you just through the screen all you have to do is
3:47
position yourself where the anointing is and um that's just a beautiful example of like loving people you don't even
3:54
know um you know if you have that in your heart I want everyone in in the
3:59
whole world to be saved to be delivered to be healed to encounter God people I don't know then um God Will Make A Way
4:07
for that love to reach them you know he'll make a way when you have that in
4:12
your heart you're you know you you will be move to share your testimony and God
4:18
will many times even lead that testimony to reach many many many people so
4:26
um that's that's one example right there is just having a heart for everyone in
4:32
this world and and when you have a heart for everyone in this world you live a certain way like you you won't hold your
4:40
testimony back you'll be serious about sharing your testimony and you'll be serious about using your social media
4:45
for God's glory you will not hold back you will let your light shine you will
4:50
put your light um on a lampstand like you'll lift it up because of your love
4:58
for people um you you will not hold back your testimony that's a big way to love
5:04
that God is calling us to love like the whole world and when we're able to reach so many people in the whole world if
5:11
that's if if it's our heart to share our testimony because God will literally open up doors for so many to hear your
5:19
testimony because that kind of love coming forth through you like I love you
5:25
and I want you to receive what I've received the love of God the he
5:30
Deliverance healing that's what brings salvation healing and deliverance because God uses people the most so um
5:38
that's that's like a big way that God is asking you to love people uh like the
5:45
whole world and um then God will ask you to love love your strangers love love
5:52
your strangers love your neighbors who are strangers in your day-to-day you know you should put on love every day
5:58
like I'm going out in the the world I'm going to do errands I'm going to the workplace I'm going to meet with my
6:04
family um and I'm putting on love I'm I'm making the intention to love them
6:09
I'm making an intention to treat the um
6:14
the people I interact with at the store at where where I have appointments I'm making the intention to treat them
6:20
with kindness with love if I'm if I'm annoyed inside if um you know things are
6:26
taking a really long time in the line or something like that or the appointment I'm putting on love I'm making the intention to be patient with them to be
6:34
kind to be loving that's the big way of how God is asking you to love everyone
6:41
um and then within your your there will be certain people that God is calling
6:46
you to uh have relationship with he'll be calling you to have a certain
6:51
relationship with people and in in that the love will look different even more
6:57
like God will ask you to do acts of service for for them you know put them first um and be a good
7:05
listener and um just constantly treating them with love and kindness um even if
7:12
you're seeing them so frequently and uh you know maybe you get annoyed or
7:17
frustrated with them or something but you're you're you're still putting on love through all of
7:25
that so that's that's um that's a brief uh uh answer to that
7:32
question we could go on longer but there's a there's a good
7:37
answer how can I comfort a friend being so sad and brokenhearted because of a breakup with his girlfriend who he
7:44
thought was the one uh encourage him encourage him that
7:50
God is in control that God's hand is upon his life
7:55
and God knows best sometimes we think we know best so often I mean every single
8:00
person this has happened to I think several times every single child of God this has happened I believe several
8:06
times where we think we know best we think something's God's will we think a
8:11
certain timing a certain you know timing that something should happen is best we think a certain career choice is best we
8:18
we think a certain relationship is best but it is not God has even greater God
8:25
has even better and so um it it just comes down to trusting trusting God if
8:33
God is allowing this door to shut right now then that just means he has better
8:40
that just means he has better and it it just means that it it's it
8:46
it's not supposed to be open it's supposed to be shut God is in control and we just trust that he is going to
8:54
bring better he his perfect will will be done as he he directs the steps of the righteous man and woman so as long as
9:01
you are surrendered to God God is leading your steps period God is in
9:06
control period there is nothing to worry about there's nothing to be disappointed
9:12
about even because God's best is for is going to be in your life oh yeah back to
9:18
my previous question about sharing testimony another way to love people is not only sharing your testimony like the
9:25
another way to love so many people like friends and family and strangers and the whole world is by sharing uh like the
9:33
where you are planted sharing testimonies there of what's Happening Miracles um teachings sharing them God
9:42
is moving through it so you want them to encounter God in power and he's going to
9:47
go through he's going to move through the vide so sharing those is loving his people too not only your personal
9:55
testimony but sharing what is blessing you the ways that God has been blessing
10:01
you through through teachings through test other people's testimonies through Miracles that's the same way other
10:06
people will encounter Jesus so by sharing them yes how can we see in the spiritual
10:14
realm is this a gift or does it depend on your intimacy and maturity with an in Christ um the Bible
10:23
says we walk by faith and not by sight we walk by faith and not by sight
10:32
faith is spiritual sight and so many times people think when they're thinking about spiritual
10:38
sight seen in the spiritual realm they're thinking so much physical they're thinking it means seeing Angels
10:46
demons seeing um physical things in the spiritual realm it can be that it
10:53
absolutely can be that and especially those called in the office of of
10:59
prophets um and just depending on God's calling
11:05
that will be the case they will be seeing things in the spiritual realm physically like like uh like Visions
11:12
Visions um but but but it's not just the
11:17
Visions it's not just the seeing an angel and seeing a demon and seeing things like that in the spiritual realm
11:23
so tangibly that's not the only kind of spiritual sight um the biggest kind of
11:29
spiritual sight is is uh uh really based on faith it it the real kind of
11:37
spiritual sight is more of a knowing a the knowledge you've received spiritual
11:43
food and spiritual knowledge you've received that has opened up your spiritual eyes in terms of faith in
11:52
terms of knowledge of the spiritual realm um knowledge and faith faith and
11:59
confidence in the spiritual realm you know like understanding the principles
12:04
of the kingdom of God like so many things that I teach you know you know
12:10
about like doors that we open the power of our words the power of sewing that
12:18
there will be a reaping um walking in your Authority in Christ and that
12:25
there's power in that and you you been given Authority and demons and the
12:31
kingdom of darkness have to obey and we have authority on this earth when we speak things will happen uh you know
12:39
like all these principles these principles of the kingdom of God um just
12:44
just just that spiritual knowledge that God is with you and hears you um and he
12:50
NE he never leaves you uh that's really spiritual eyesight um is that you have
12:58
that know knowledge that spiritual knowledge I'm not talking about um like um knowledge you get in school I'm
13:06
not talking about knowledge you get in Bible school I'm talking about like
13:12
Revelations Revelations that you have received re like for example I've
13:17
received many Revelations from the Holy Spirit a lot so many of them have come from God through my spiritual father
13:23
Prophet J Davy and so many of you have received Revelations um from God that
13:28
come through me through teaching through your spiritual mother
13:34
um you've received these Revelations and you've changed because of these
13:39
Revelations you you haven't just heard them and been like oh wow that's powerful that's deep oh that's a good
13:46
word but no you you've been changed and the way you've been changed is your spiritual eyes have opened up it's like
13:55
you've you've received this Revelation and and it the Revelation has actually opened up your eyes so um just
14:03
as much as I can see and feel and know that that this glass is and water is
14:10
real I have the same confidence of the spiritual Realm of the
14:16
principles of the spiritual Realm of the reality that God is with me inside me
14:22
right now um of the power of my words of the fact that demons have to obey when I
14:29
command them you know um of the fact that depression and
14:36
anxiety and tourettes and all these things they're demonic oppression I know this with all my heart
14:43
as much as I know that this cup is real right um how do I know that it's because
14:50
my spiritual eyes have opened up I know that this cup is real because my eyes can see
14:55
it my eyes can see it and so therefore I know it's real so my spiritual eyes can
15:02
see all of these things it's not that I'm it's not your spiritual eyes can see all these things it's not like you're
15:08
hearing a good word oh that's deep oh that's powerful no you like the word has
15:13
come to you and it has power on it it has anointing on it and you have at least a mustard seed of Faith so God can
15:19
work with that God can work with that so that your eyes can open up as the word
15:25
comes forth with anointing on it I remember when I first encountered God's
15:30
power the season where I first encountered God's power and um and I I I
15:36
saw like demons cast out for the first time when I saw you know demons manifesting in people and them cast out
15:42
in the first time I was like my eyes have seen like my spiritual eyes have seen like this is real like there wasn't
15:50
1% of me that thought maybe this is fake maybe this is acting I knew this was
15:55
real my spiritual eyes opened up and encountering in God I mean my spiritual eyes open up in that to those to that
16:02
reality of like the realness of God going from that place of like never having tangible experiences with God
16:09
encounters with God never like I mean God just feeling far away right believing in God but he just felt far
16:16
away and I never had a tangible encounter with his power where he was up close tangibly I I encountered that so
16:25
back then and in that phase of My Life um it was really hard for me
16:31
to remember that God was with me I believed God was with me and heard me and knew me heard my prayers and knew my
16:38
heart but I didn't know it I I believed it but I didn't know it down deep and
16:44
therefore I would forget so many times because it wasn't real to me my eyes
16:50
technically weren't open my spiritual eyes weren't open up to even that truth that God is with me all the time my
16:57
spiritual eyes weren't even open to the truth about God's love like really his love for me it was more of just I
17:03
believe like how we believe in Santa you know kids believe in Santa with all their heart but it's very different from
17:10
um them actually meeting Santa like knowing so it was like that I really
17:16
believed but my spiritual eyes hadn't seen yet I just believed but my eyes were shut right and so then when I
17:23
encountered God in power when I saw these Miracles happening when I received prophetic word for the first time in my
17:29
life um my spiritual eyes opened up and so I remember the next day I was walking
17:36
around I was a nanny at the time I remember this distinctly I remember
17:41
driving and I remember like realizing Jesus it's like Jesus is sitting in the seat beside me
17:48
in the car I just I was walking to the school to pick up the boy that I nannied and I just was
17:56
like it's like Jesus is right here going down the stairs right now with me as I'm going down the stairs I remember
18:02
this so vividly but it was like my spiritual eyes had seen and so now I
18:07
didn't have to like remind myself oh yeah God's here he's with me that's
18:13
really hard to comprehend it was like God's here go it was an knowing because
18:18
my spiritual eyes had opened up right so um spiritual sight that is um the real
18:25
meaning of spiritual sight is the is knowing in the spiritual realm and the
18:30
prophetic is spiritual sight when I most times when I'm
18:37
receiving uh uh words from God for people the when the prophetic anointing
18:43
is upon me I'm not seeing words written before
18:49
me I'm not seeing things in the Physical Realm but just God fills my mouth this
18:58
know KN comes in me and by faith I speak it
19:03
out uh but it's it's that that's spiritual sight but it's not like I see
19:11
I see this and I see this now um it can happen that way it can't happen that way I know my spiritual father Prophet jvy
19:17
like he can really like see like sometimes God will God can like give him like
19:24
vision and seen um someone's past for example the things they've gone through
19:29
like like seeing it and depending on a person's calling God can bring that from
19:35
time to time but um really the important thing to realize is that the visions and and and seeing
19:43
things like physically like visionwise um is not the limit to
19:49
spiritual sight that's just a part of what spiritual sight can mean but the real spiritual sight is that is your
19:57
spiritual eyes being opened where you have Revelation and it's an knowing in
20:03
you it's an knowing in your spirit when I go and I preach there is this knowing in me
20:10
because I see because I see in the spirit real there's this knowing like that what I'm preaching is true that's
20:17
where that's why there's passion and confidence behind it and that's because my spiritual eyesight has eyesight has
20:22
increased I remember when I first started preaching I was way more timid I I I I didn't have this full confidence
20:28
in what I was preaching but as my spiritual eyesight is grown and I become
20:35
so confident so you know just knowing this is truth the spiritual principles
20:40
the revelations God's given me is true I get passionate and excited and um
20:47
um um and have fuel and energy to work hard for God because I have seen and I
20:54
want others eyes to open up too so they can see so the spiritual sight comes so much
21:01
through impartation it comes from planning yourself being having a spiritual father spiritual mother or
21:06
spiritual mother planning yourself and uh the prophetic anointing comes upon you the the spiritual eyesight comes so
21:14
much from through teaching through anointed teaching and anointing coming upon you through the teaching and so
21:19
your spiritual eyes open up and you see the world differently you see the world accurately you you understand the you
21:26
understand the spiritual reality you're seen you're seen um and so it
21:32
comes so much through the teachings and then it also comes through the impartation so even um sometimes when
21:39
God is calling you to minister to people there can be a prophetic there'll be a prophetic anointing that comes upon you that's what happened for me
21:47
um like nine months after I started fful Church which was um almost a year and a
21:55
half after I first received the prophecy that I was called to be an apostle so when I I first received reptation then
22:02
like that was the beginning but then I received more and more and more as I was
22:08
faithful a little God would then pour more and so nine months after having
22:14
Church starting the church I went to my spiritual father's Church in Tanzania East Africa hungry to receive more from
22:20
God and God poured out such powerful impartation upon me um I was so
22:27
different I the plane I just for 20 24 plus hours I
22:32
wasn't watching any movies not not that watching movies nothing's wrong with that but I was like just changed I was um
22:41
elevated in the spiritual realm my spirit was so strengthened um and and I opened all
22:48
I wanted to do was read the Bible and pray and that's what I did the entire flight and when I read the Bible my eyes were open like I was getting Revelation
22:55
I never got before as I was reading the word and then when I um ministered that
23:01
Sunday I saw the power of God move through me for the first time I saw um a
23:06
woman who was actually Jean's mom before jeanal came she fell back with the power of God as I placed my hand on her hand
23:12
it's the first time I've seen that happen through my Ministry and then I started praying for a person and then there knowing Came Upon me the prophetic
23:18
anointing Came Upon me for the first time and I started praying for a person and words came out of my mouth like
23:23
personal words about this woman and she started crying and then I pray for another person the same thing happened
23:29
and another person the same thing happened um so through the impartation my spiritual eyes opened up
23:35
um more so so so that's your spiritual eyesight for the most part is the
23:40
knowledge and confidence uh of the spiritual realm um and and spiritual
23:49
principles and number two the prophetic Ministry the prophetic anointing coming
23:55
upon you for Ministry for other people so it's it's the
24:02
spiritual eyesight is seeing the the principles in the Kingdom uh the spiritual realm and then number two
24:08
seeing for other people to minister to other people what's the difference between
24:14
giving glory to someone versus giving
24:20
honor uh so like when it comes to I guess we should we'll talk about
24:27
cuz this could be any anybody but we'll talk about in the church okay cuz we
24:34
are we are to give God all the glory and to take no glory for ourselves and
24:39
really the meaning of that is really believing really knowing that
24:46
it's God that does everything it's God that does every miracle and it's also
24:52
God who opens up doors so we can even you
24:57
you know have a place to worship him you know have a church building and have um
25:03
equipment and everything you know like no one should take credit like I got
25:09
this building or something for the church or you know like even even if God uses you to pay or something for the
25:16
whole building let's say um God you shouldn't take Glory like oh
25:22
because of me only this is why that's just an example of like taking of like
25:28
giving Glory um so so so like even just having a building having equipment have
25:34
you know just the things that need to be done that you need to have and that need to be done to have even the work of God
25:42
uh go forth it's so important to realize that God's in it all that God is the one
25:47
that's even making anything possible that God is the one that gives us breath that God is the one that created us that
25:53
God is the one that put gifts inside of us that God is the one who um wakes us
25:59
up every day God is the one giving us the strength and the ability to do
26:05
everything so we as children of God should realize that should know that should remember that for our own
26:12
personal lives so we aren't taking Glory from God and also towards other people towards other
26:19
people that you look up to towards leaders that you look up to it's important you have that knowing of how
26:25
much God is behind everything that God is the cream of everything like um
26:33
like we C- labor with God we do things with God but he's the greatest force
26:38
behind it you know yes we God needs us we collabor it's it's it's not just God
26:45
it's us and God right but but God's the most of it right so you to have that you know
26:53
knowledge is important just to have that kind of knowledge um and to see God in
26:58
everything to see God in everything so you know and all the beauty that you see
27:04
in in in in in in everything in the beautiful worship singing and worship
27:10
band and the the the amazing preaching that you see God in it all like wow God
27:17
you know you you created this person to have this beautiful voice For Your Glory wow I praise you you know you include
27:23
him in that rather than idolizing the person like you have the most amazing
27:30
voice period and that like in your mind you're just like oh you know but it's
27:36
like but yes you you recognize a person's gifting and you're thankful
27:42
that they're saying yes to God and God can use them but at the same time you
27:48
don't forget that God needs credit too you know they can't sing without God so
27:54
it's just that kind of like um that that knowledge that you renew your mind so that you are living your life giving
28:01
glory to God in everything you're living your life giving giving glory to God in everything you never forget to give him
28:07
glory you're just always including him right and so then when we talk about let's talk about ministers now um you
28:14
know uh as they preaching and and walking in Miracle signs wonders healing
28:21
Deliverance it is God's power that does everything so whenever Miracle takes
28:28
place it's important for the minister and the people to know to realize to
28:35
remember God did that that is God like that is power that is Supernatural and
28:41
only God can do that that wasn't a physical thing that took place and all of us here we physical people but it's
28:48
God who's the supernatural one it's God who has all the power so that healing that Deliverance that was 100% God that
28:55
was 100% God working through a vessel through through flowing through so
29:03
whenever a miracle takes place in our hearts it should immediately be thank you Jesus thank you God God you're
29:09
amazing God you did that you did that wow not even like you and the minister
29:17
did that together no like God did that that was God 100% that's the right way for believers
29:23
to um like be in their hearts uh and then when Miracles take place you're
29:30
able you're automatically giving glory to God you're automatically praising God you're already remembering and knowing
29:36
this is God so that's how we give him glory and then when we testify about it I saw all these miracles happen I saw
29:41
the all these miracles happen at fivefold church at the Revival is now event and you say God did these Jesus
29:47
did these Miracles I saw Jesus do all these Miracles you know you don't say I saw
29:52
Apostle Katherine do all these Miracles you say I saw Jesus do all these miracles as you spread the word as you
29:58
testify that's how you're giving God glory amen so that's that's giving God
30:04
glory so then the question was the difference between uh oh what's the difference between giving glory to
30:10
someone versus giving honor so honor is super important honor is very important
30:17
the Bible says um give honor where honor is
30:23
due if a lot of honor is due then a lot of Honor should be given that's a
30:29
revelation when honor is due somewhere give it if little honor is due give little honor don't don't not give any
30:36
honor give a little honor but if a lot of honor is due give a lot of Honor this is very important um you know so many
30:44
times um in the Bible you know Jesus he says to his disciples when they receive you
30:50
they've received me we are we are his Representatives um
30:56
Servants of God are his representatives and you can't SE it's like God his biggest way of moving is
31:03
through vessels is through people that's his biggest way of
31:09
moving when it comes to healing and deliverance when it comes to um uh
31:16
speaking even you know the the prophetic word and and and and and so many times
31:22
God is the biggest way he's speaking even like Direction in your life and and increase your your spiritual eyesight
31:29
and your spiritual knowledge about his kingdom and about him it's coming through teaching it's coming through
31:35
people and so um you know you can't separate God and people when it comes to
31:43
such a big way of how God works to touch people like they're they're colloring
31:49
together um and so the truth is is that it's because of people's obedience
31:55
Servants of God's obedience that the anointing God could entrust them with and pour in their lives and so then a
32:03
person could then be delivered and healed by the anointing moving through the person so it's 100% God that does
32:09
everything and he gets all the glory for all of the works for all of the Miracles it's him who who's done it but God also
32:17
wants uh his vessels to be recognized and his vessels to be honored and for just this truth to be known and to be uh
32:26
uh honored this truth that because of this obedience this has happened because
32:31
of this obedience God is able to move so the vessels are are important you know they're they're they are important and
32:38
worthy of honor because this is just God's way God doesn't choose to do Miracles like from Heaven straight to
32:44
Earth without a vessel for the most part usually most times uh God wants that to
32:50
be known and that's very it's very important because the more that we like understand this make this known and
32:56
honor giving honor where honors due the more his vessels will be accepted and
33:02
received which in turn means that the more God can move the more God can move for example
33:11
um apost through Apostles and Prophets is where so much of the the Miracles the
33:17
healing the Deliverance um the prophetic word that is needed for the body of Christ and
33:24
needed for individual believers it's coming through them so much you know with Apostles and Prophets
33:30
it says they're part of the foundation with Christ Jesus as the Chief Cornerstone and so God does through we
33:37
see in the book of Acts we see Philip the Evangelist was doing many signs wonders and miracles but it's
33:42
interesting if you look in the acts church we see that example of Philip the Evangelist but um we don't see an
33:49
example of a pastor Walking In Miracles we don't see an example of many teachers
33:54
Walking In Miracles that's not to say they don't walk in in Miracles that's a calling for everyone to walk in air in Miracles uh these signs shall follow all
34:02
who believe so not even just fivefold ministers but all who believe should be casting out demons should be Healing The Sick should be walking in the power of
34:08
God but there is some Revelation to be had about this fact in the acts church about how it's mostly the apostles that
34:16
we see and Prophets walking in the power of God it's some Revelation to be had it's it's it's just speaking of that's
34:22
really so much their calling especially with Apostles it says the true Sant apostle multiple times Paul says this
34:28
the true sign is that they walk in signs wonders and miracles so the fact that he said that that's the true sign of an
34:33
apostle specifically really speaks to us that that's the main office where we're
34:39
going to be seeing the signs and wonders and miracles and the main office to equip and impart anointing to
34:46
others okay so um and and and and and the prophets are so important I mean I
34:53
would not be here today in my calling if it weren't for a prophet um speaking the
34:58
word of God the calling the direction upon my life I would I would not be sharing this word Revival as now where
35:05
now so many so many around the world are believing this word and stepping into Revival rather than hiding in their
35:13
closets praying for Revival and missing out on the Revival and missing out on Deliverance and healing and
35:19
impartation this that receiving the Revival and walking in the Revival and seeing the Revival take place that would
35:25
not have happened if weren't for my spiritual father Prophet J Davy because he prophesied God has sent me here from
35:31
East Africa to LA to prophesy this to America not just to LA to America and to
35:36
the world but it was starting like really in America that God has heard your prayers for Revival in America and
35:42
he's answering them now God is pouring out Apostles and Prophets and and releasing this revival and nothing can
35:47
stop it now it is Revival now that was a prophetic word and so um that was a real
35:54
word and and and and and this is God's way that he he chooses to bring these big directional words through prophets
36:01
so that there's order we see how Moses uh he was sent by
36:06
God as a prophet to to speak to prophesy to the about million of uh the
36:14
Israelites you've been for hundreds of years in slavery but now is Revival now
36:19
is Deliverance time now God is setting you free and you are going to the we're
36:25
going to the promised land we going to be leav in Egypt by God's power now and because they eventually accepted
36:32
it and received it they were able to leave otherwise they would have been maybe afraid uh that Pharaoh would come
36:39
and haunt them down which they he did but God was protected them um and and
36:46
and parted the sea and swallowed up Pharaoh Pharaoh's armies um you know but
36:51
like because they were able to receive the word of the Prophet this is God's way they were all able to be delivered
36:56
so we need Apostles and Prophets to be received so God can move through them and so when they're not accept when
37:03
they're not honored now honored just simply means well number one
37:08
accepted accepted that you are a servant of God and that God is moving through you and that you are called to release
37:16
something to me I'm called to receive something from you not be like on the same level or try to teach you or
37:21
something but I'm called to receive from you from the Apostle the prophet my ears are open and humbly to receive from you
37:29
um that's part of Honor but um the second part of honor is
37:35
to to you know be thankful and be thankful in different ways you know
37:42
thankful through testimonies you know testifying for example you know it's
37:47
important you shouldn't just say God delivered me from anxiety but you should
37:53
say God delivered me from anxiety this is how it happened I went to fifel
37:59
church or wherever it was whatever Ministry whatever church and um this
38:05
certain Minister prayed for me and God moved through them so being clear that
38:11
it's God that did it um but acknowledging and giving honor where
38:18
honor is due that it was through a vessel that's very important because number
38:23
one it's helping people to rec recognize and be able to receive oh this is a true
38:30
servant of God number one but number two it's helping people to understand to to
38:36
know deliverance and healing I can receive God is moving in this way but where is it happening it's not happening
38:41
in any old way it's not happening just praying in my room and coming to me for the most part there's exceptions but to
38:48
hear it's happening here it's happening through this vessel is where it happened so go position yourself under that
38:54
anointing you know just like in the times of of Peter they would position themselves specifically under the shadow of apostle Peter they wouldn't just go
39:01
finding Shadows of any any old person they wouldn't go finding Shadows of trees the Bible doesn't say they
39:07
position them they positioned themselves wherever a shadow was and they believed the power of God would move through any kind of Shadow it says specifically they
39:14
went to Apostle Peter's Shadow position themselves there where the anointing was flowing and the shadow Came Upon them
39:22
and delivered them and healed them so that was in those days people would have been saying
39:27
go find Peter Shadow go where he is ministering go position yourself there that's where I received healing that's
39:33
where I received Freedom that's where you can receive too that's where God is moving amen so um like to in testimony
39:41
it's very important to give honor in that way to say this is how God did it
39:47
um the honor is so important because it's helping people receive especially
39:52
Apostles and Prophets are so um rejected right and so honor actually
39:59
becomes like critical like crucial for the sake of others to be able to receive
40:06
through Apostle Peter of today you know Apostle Paul of today it's critical it's love for God
40:14
and love for people to give honor where honor is due you know so um that's a way of
40:21
honoring another way of honoring is just with actions with with actions with um
40:27
like really being appreciative of that coll laboring that's taking place being
40:32
appreciative that uh because a servant of God has been
40:37
obedient um to God God was able to move through them and touch you and so you're
40:44
appreciative to God but you're also appreciative to the servant of God
40:49
because you understand that it was a C- laboring that took place C- laboring with god um you understand that
40:56
it's also because the obedience without the obedience it wouldn't have happened just because that's God's way of moving
41:02
um and so it's like you give honor with your heart you share gratitude with your
41:08
heart you give honor with with words but you also give honor and action um like
41:16
like sewing sewing into the the ministry this is like you're show you're giving
41:21
honor like this was given to me freely this was given to me freely by God and
41:28
um the ministry was given to me freely because the ministry is the servant of God's ministry right
41:35
like um it's their Ministry God's the leader of the ministry God's in charge
41:40
of the ministry right but it's like their Ministry specific Ministry so you um you're so grateful for that specific
41:48
Ministry you're grateful for the work of God that's been done there the hard work that's been done there the um pers
41:56
persevering through um persecution for the sake of the love for
42:01
you that's gone on there so you you honor that Ministry there with with
42:08
sewing you in one hand you're you're giving back in a way right but it's not
42:14
just that you are you are sewing into this ground you
42:20
are honoring this ground and the honor comes back upon you God honors you God pours more to you because you've honored
42:28
um the there's a scripture in the Bible that in in I believe it's Psalms it talks about um water and you two will be
42:36
watered so it's like there's this tree that has brought you amazing fruit
42:45
that's sustained you that's blessed you and you want to water that tree so it'll
42:50
keep bringing fruit um you you you want to bring honor there so it'll stay alive
42:57
it won't perish it won't die um and honestly like giving honor to Servants of God
43:06
really actually is a way that God uses you
43:12
to water them even water them spiritually like um I can't tell you
43:20
how like gratitude that I've heard from from many of you from many people
43:26
and honor um I can't tell you how I've felt God's love and encouragement
43:33
through that um how it sustained me through really difficult times through difficult times of
43:39
persecution I can't tell you how much it's like God's moved through that in love and um and inspiration and
43:48
encouragement and motivation to keep working hard tirelessly day after day so it really
43:56
like giving honor really does water that thing that's blessing you right that
44:02
Ministry so the servant of God and God through the servant of God it's watering
44:07
Waters you what continues to water you continues to bless you um and God really
44:13
cares about honor so much many people don't realize this in Western culture they do not understand how they're missing out the more you honor the more
44:20
God will honor you the more you honor the more the anointing will flow in your life this is a really huge principle I write about it in my book too it's a
44:27
really huge principle of receiving the anointing is honor the people who will walk in
44:32
powerful anointing are the ones that can be humble enough to honor the ones who will be selfless enough to
44:38
honor Hallelujah and I think so many people
44:44
are like too Pride the problem is they're too prideful to honor they're too prideful to honor so we got to get
44:51
rid of that pride and humble ourselves that's one of the big tests of humility and God want to pour out
44:57
anointing upon you God needs to see that you have a humble heart through and
45:02
through so many people that they have egos and they care what people think about them and maybe they themselves
45:08
want to look important and powerful and so their heart is not in that place of honoring but when that is not in you but
45:15
your heart is just for God and you are you have gratitude for how you've been
45:21
blessed how you've been blessed through a Ministry through a spiritual father and mother um um when that's in your
45:27
heart and you like realize wow I've received so much because of their
45:35
obedience um and that's just your heart completely and your heart is anything else your heart isn't any kind of
45:42
selfish ambition uh then you will have that Revelation to
45:47
honor I've gotten so much in so much trouble with the religious spirit for honoring my spiritual father I mean what
45:54
I mean the spir I've bumped heads with a religious spirit so much um there's
46:00
there's in the African culture to kneel down is how you show honor and respect
46:08
to kneel down to a servant of God to an elder even is is is how you show respect
46:13
and honor it's it's it's part of that action remember how I said you should honor in words and action that's that's
46:20
a big way that they honor an action it's the culture there um and it's that place
46:27
of humility there you know it's that place of humility like I I literally see
46:32
like you're at a higher level in the spiritual realm and I've received from you and I honor you and I want to
46:37
receive more from you so like I humble myself um servant of God I honor you you
46:44
know I honor this anointing upon your life so that's that's why it's beautiful it's why they do that in that culture of
46:51
of a kneeling down think because it's really this place of humility of putting yourself low
46:57
um and honoring the anointing it's it's all honor honoring the anointing in that servant of
47:03
God and God really Delights in that um but that's not giving glory to God a lot
47:08
of people they think that they think in Western culture they that that isn't part of the culture and
47:16
so they think it's like a bowing down type thing you know like um I think like
47:21
you know the Middle Eastern like what is it Middle Eastern religions like they
47:26
they bow they bow to their God and they literally like like this and they they go down and so that's literally worship
47:34
that is worship but to kneel down like in the African culture is not worshiping
47:41
anybody any person but it's just giving honor and so um to for me to go to that
47:48
culture and be like I'm American I'm not going to do that that's weird that's
47:55
actually being super prideful and also just like caring what
48:00
people think so much and thinking that my culture is better but I believe that every culture
48:07
is equally beautiful and I actually believe that there's beautiful Godly things like honor
48:13
that in general Africans do better than America and so if that's their way of
48:19
honoring I want to honor in the way that they honor to be the most honoring cuz
48:25
to honor any other way would be less honoring because that's the way they honor you know um Paul says I became
48:32
like some to paraphrase it he says I became like them I became like that culture so that they would receive the
48:38
Gospel through me um it doesn't mean um what Paul was saying was he wasn't
48:44
talking about like um they were drinking alcohol so I was drinking like with them
48:51
too so they no he wasn't talking about that he was talking about this that I'm talking about now I don't do that in my
48:56
culture but they do that in their culture and who's to say that how I honor my culture is better than their no
49:02
no no no I'm there and so so that they can receive the love of God through me
49:09
so that they can receive God's love through me H his word I am going to be like them
49:15
with how they honor yeah and but there was a video of
49:21
it and a lot of people thought I was worshiping my spiritual father but I've never worship my spiritual father ever
49:27
but I have honored him and I'm proud to have honored it I mean I'm like I'm um I
49:33
know what by proud I mean I'm I know that the right thing to do I know that's the right thing to do to honor and I
49:39
want to keep honoring him so I can keep pleasing God and so I can keep receiving
49:44
and so I can keep remaining humble and that's one of the keys of why
49:51
the power of God in general tends to move more mightily we see the power power of God Miracle happening mostly in
49:58
Africa more than anywhere else and one of the biggest reasons why is because they know how to honor and that's one of
50:05
the biggest principles of seeing the anointing flow is properly honoring seeing the anointing flow in the
50:12
church in the in the work of but also in individuals lives and a beautiful example was in
50:19
Charlotte and literally that was honestly I mean it was honestly a key one of the big keys of why the anointing
50:27
flowed so powerfully in Charlotte the on the honor
50:34
unlocks there's more but people limit the anointing the flow of the anointing they limit with lack of humility and
50:42
lack of Honor don't let the religious spirit lie to you don't let the religious spirit
50:50
hates honor honor of Servants of God um and remember I shared with with you one
50:56
of the big reasons honor is important is because it it's it's what will lead to more people
51:03
their eyes opening up this is where I can receive you know the more people that share I was healed under the shadow
51:11
of Peter the more people will realize he's truly from God and I'm going to go
51:16
check this out you know but if nobody's spreading that word or if everyone's
51:23
afraid to if they you know or even if they just go and share God healed me but they don't share that it was under
51:30
Peter's Shadow for example back then then people literally won't go to Peter's Shadow but God needs the word to
51:38
spread about Peter's Shadow so that's a big reason why the religious spirit
51:44
because the religious spirit why the religious spirit hates honor because the religious spirit does not want the new
51:50
wine does not want the power of God to move does not want Apostles and Prophets to be accepted by any body um the
51:57
religious spirit of today just wants things to say how they how it is um
52:02
wants no Apostles and Prophets wants no power of God wants no new wine so you got to really be aware of that that
52:08
that's the spirit we're fighting against um that the more you embrace the new
52:13
wine the more you Embrace God's way his Revival the more that you're surrendered in this area of receiving you're not
52:20
just a spectator but the more that you Embrace God in this new way you do
52:27
things like honor you do these principles of embracing accepting and being a real
52:34
accepting of the Revival and being a real Warrior of God the more you do this
52:39
please know that the religious spirit will come and attack I mean that's given
52:46
okay so be aware of that and be aware oh the religious spirit hates this does not
52:51
want this to go forth that's why this coming is coming so just be aware spiritually and don't
52:57
listen to the religious spirit don't bow down to the religious spirit don't give into the religious spirit serve God not
53:03
the religious spirit [Laughter] amen how can we best show honor to you a
53:12
glory to God just as God leads in your heart but I would say one thing that
53:17
really just like personally how I feel I could be like honored the best is just
53:24
to really be unashamed about your testimony if you have received through
53:30
my Ministry if you've received healing Deliverance if you've been brought closer to Jesus whatever you've received
53:36
that you would be really unashamed you would be unashamed of um because I know
53:42
there's there's there's haters of me you know there's there's controversy you
53:47
know um so that you you know you wouldn't be intimidated by that or afraid of that or anything but you would
53:53
be unashamed and so that that you would spread the word um because I it always Grieves me
54:00
when I just see people that believe lies and I just think about this I just think about how I've been given this precious
54:08
anointing and it's just I just want to give it out to everyone and it always breaks my heart when I know that people
54:14
could be free but they're saying in bondage because there's so many lies out
54:20
there about the anointing about me um and so they're believ in them and maybe
54:28
they've heard more lies than truth and so that's what my heart burns for is the
54:33
truth to to overpower the lies and the way that will happen is by testimony
54:40
just like that Samaritan woman at the well was just so unashamed she went and told everybody she was unashamed of
54:48
Jesus knowing her personal stuff she was so unashamed and she told everybody and that's what led to the the Revival
54:54
breaking out that's what led to the Harvest beginning so I know that in God's perfect timing more more and more
55:00
and more and more will be reached and Promises will be fulfilled that I haven't seen come to pass yet but I know
55:07
it will happen by the the scales shifting to where it's such a fight
55:13
between the lies of the devil and truth to it shifting to the truth
55:20
overpowering and the lies don't have power anymore and so people won't be
55:27
stuck in darkness with those lies anymore and they won't stay stuck in their bondage with it they can simply
55:32
come and receive I see God moving so mightily so easily like just I still
55:37
can't stop thinking about the testimony from on Wednesday about the guy from Philippines like delivered from so I
55:43
haven't even heard a testimony like that in my life like Tourette's I never even heard about someone being delivered from Tourette's but tourettes and seizures
55:48
and schizophren and all of this gone it just it it's just so amazing how God is
55:55
choosing to move so powerfully right now and with so much ease and so I just my heart burns for just everyone to just
56:01
come receive you know my heart burns for for people to not be in the dark anymore and be stuck that's the devil trying to
56:09
keep people stuck in the bondage I just want their eyes to open up I just want them to know the truth and just come and
56:16
receive that's the biggest thing that my heart burns for and I know
56:22
honoring um the ministry will really help that's that's what will make the scales shift is when more and more
56:29
people be unashamed of sharing the truth and don't stay quiet because of fear of
56:38
man person by person one by one that's how so many more will be
56:45
reached there's so many more in the more people in the world it's glory to God we've we've reached so many people in
56:53
this revival Hallelujah but there's so many more there's so many more out there that we can't forget about we can't get
57:00
content we can't get complacent
57:05
amen people mainly in the west often make the men women of God in their lives too common like just another person they
57:12
develop a familiarity and fall fail to see the anointing in their life exactly that's having to do with lack of Honor
57:18
they people see Servants of God is just common just just like them but
57:25
it's not right you need to see them really H how who they are in the spiritual realm and see that this is
57:31
your place of receiving from and and you need to honor for that to take
57:39
place yes I have a message by the way about Honor on the Revival army training
57:44
playlist on my YouTube so you can learn more about that
57:50
there um I forget what it's called but it's something honor honor honoring the
57:55
anointing maybe on the Revival army training
58:01
playlist if we can't honor Servants of God how can how can we honor God truly exactly and that's what's so powerful
58:07
about when um Jesus says those if they receive you they have received
58:15
me I don't know the exact verse this just came to me now but there's a verse that says if they receive you they
58:22
receive me so that's power so if they're not receiving the the disciples if they're
58:28
not receiving the apostles they're not receiving the Servants of God they're not receiving God because this is the way that God wants to come right you
58:35
know I mean with with the prophetic word with the word God is speaking Revival is
58:42
now you know accepting and receiving if they're not going to receive this that this is what God is doing they're not
58:48
receiving God and it's really sobering it's really shocking to think about how
58:54
many people people are not actually receiving God
59:00
they're they're having Ministries you know they're preaching Jesus but they're not receiving him um in his in his new
59:10
wine move they're not receiving his new servants that he's raising
59:17
up um you can't do that you can't pick and choose parts of God to receive from you
59:23
you you h you have to receive his servants his his generals his leaders
59:30
and his body or you're not receiving him and this is we should have the fear of
59:36
God this is really sobering really this is really sobering so many people they want to separate God from vessel so much
59:42
but you can't because this is just God's way it's just God's
59:48
way and when you the more Revelation you have that the more honoring you become like that's why I have honored my SP
59:54
father so much because God has opening my eyes and that is the key one of the keys of why I received the
1:00:01
anointing it's these things that are too hard for people because of Pride they don't receive the anointing but my eyes have opened up and
1:00:09
I have seen like because of your obedience I've been able to encounter
1:00:14
God like never before and I have a beautiful relationship with him because of your
1:00:21
obedience I I I I'm walking in my calling I I'm seeing so many people healed
1:00:28
delivered and come to Jesus because of your anointing because of your
1:00:35
obedience the more my eyes opened up the more I was moved to
1:00:41
honor and that's what made the anointing come that's what that's one of the
1:00:47
biggest reasons why I I've I've been so humbled to see the anointing flow into
1:00:53
my life is because I by the grace of God my eyes
1:00:58
are opened up to be able to honor to be able to honor my spiritual father to be able to honor the anointing the the
1:01:05
anointing you do not honor you cannot receive and the more you honor the the
1:01:12
anointing the more you will receive the anointing that same anointing it comes
1:01:17
through impartation it it's that same anointing that will flow upon your life that you
1:01:23
honor so when you're not honoring when you're
1:01:29
holding back you're literally missing out on receiving anointing from
1:01:34
God ah I pray your eyes are opening up so you don't miss out anymore so you
1:01:40
don't miss out anymore on what God wants to release to you and I think oh by the way I just
1:01:46
want to share this because I know that God is moving a lot of you to um in new levels and new Realms of Honor I think
1:01:52
the best this it's important to walk with wisdom like I I I understand so many new wine Revelations have to do
1:02:01
with things that really come against the spirit of religion and culture we're in and so by the grace of God I he leads me
1:02:07
in wisdom with how to to um give things little by little not a whole big
1:02:16
stake but chop up the stake do you know what I mean so people aren't choking
1:02:21
right um and so as you like this is the thing
1:02:27
um you know Jesus says you will heal the sick you will cast out demons you will
1:02:33
raise the dead you will do greater things than I did Jesus says you will do you will do it he doesn't say me and you
1:02:40
will do it now the truth is is that it's actually God doing it all but the reason why he's saying it
1:02:47
like this is because it's it's us he's given us Authority and we're walking in authority and God's entrusted us with
1:02:53
his power and and we're using that power in our own authority to do what he wants
1:02:59
us to do but it's like all our Free Will and it's like because we are walking in Authority these things are
1:03:05
happening but we understand in our hearts it's all God's power doing everything but it he actually calls it
1:03:12
like you're healing the sick but we know that it's God's power Healing The Sick
1:03:17
casting out demons but my point is is that like the Bible says that and so
1:03:23
it's not wrong wrong it's not wrong to say to a servant of God you healed me
1:03:29
you delivered me technically because that's what the word of God says right that's not
1:03:36
wrong um but but because so many people
1:03:41
have a hard they don't know the word of God they don't have Revelation with the word of God they don't understand and their their um the religious spirit is
1:03:48
so strong it's important that even if you say that and that that's not wrong that's biblical it's biblical to say to
1:03:53
a ser of God you healed me you delivered me but it's we should have the heart for
1:04:01
people to really understand we should not be like some people get so frustrated with
1:04:08
the religious spirit that they um they go extra links to offend it when we
1:04:15
should have heart a heart for people and understand that they have the religious spirit in them and speak in a way that
1:04:22
the whole the spirit of religion cannot win do you know what I'm trying to say so it's like you speak in a way that
1:04:29
they can understand you come in their language so it's like this you can say to people that are
1:04:36
spiritually mature things like this like he healed this person but we know it's God that did it we're not giving the
1:04:41
person glory to just say it simply like that it's okay but to make sure that
1:04:46
people aren't they don't know the word of God to make sure that they that they aren't understanding this wrong to make
1:04:53
sure that they know that God is the one doing it it's his power to make sure
1:04:58
that he's getting all the glory and to also make sure the spirit of religion
1:05:03
isn't snuffing out the the the beautiful thing you're saying you know you should
1:05:10
be careful with your words so that they understand you know like
1:05:16
um this like if if someone ever says to me you know you delivered me I will like
1:05:23
correct them because I want to make sure people know it's God's power that did it even though it's not wrong that they
1:05:28
what they said really based on scripture right and so as you honor you know it's
1:05:35
it's good to make sure you emphasize glory to God even if in that your heart
1:05:41
you're giving glory to God but to make sure that people understand you're giving glory to God um so that they're
1:05:47
able to really learn and their eyes are able to really open up about the principle of
1:05:53
Honor um without the spirit of religion taking over if that makes sense to walk in
1:06:00
wisdom and have that heart to like really explain to people so that they can really receive this new
1:06:06
wine amen and even if you're trying to explain to someone like maybe they're
1:06:11
thinking that that you're honoring and you're like you sound like you're worshiping you know if it's like in
1:06:17
person and online we don't need to get into huge debates so much but like if it's in person and you're talking about
1:06:22
it and if they say that take this moment if they're open you know if they're open to hear Take This Moment to really
1:06:28
explain to them explain no all glory goes to God alone but the thing is is
1:06:34
that the Bible says like Jesus says when they receive you they've received me the Bible says give honor where honor is due
1:06:41
God's opening my eyes the importance of Honor that we have to give honor to really honor God and so that's why I say
1:06:49
what I say but please don't get it twisted I am not worshiping this person I'm not giving glory to the person I'm
1:06:55
giving all glory to God and this person has pointed me closer to Jesus this person has made me glorify God more in
1:07:02
my life this person has caused me to love God more and has caused me to love God's people more um
1:07:10
so do not get it twisted I'm giving all glory to God but I've learned that it's
1:07:16
important we honor so that's what's happening here you know explain like this to help people have that heart to
1:07:23
help people people a lot of people they don't want to hear it a lot of people are just judgmental and not teachable at all but if people in your life are um
1:07:31
confused right because this new wine is new if they're confused have a heart for
1:07:37
them love them and explain to them teach them so that they can grab it so that
1:07:44
they can receive it yes people who have been hurt by the religious spirit try really hard to
1:07:51
offend it and that's it backfires that's when you're not having the love for people
1:07:57
you need to understand they have the person has a religious spirit so you're like okay I don't I don't want to
1:08:02
completely go wild I I'm going to love lovingly explain and teach instead of
1:08:08
making your mission to offend the religious spirit you're having a heart of love for God's
1:08:15
people because that happens sometimes people get so annoyed by the religious spirit that they go wild crazy they they
1:08:22
be you know W without walking in
1:08:28
wisdom I declare every Spirit of religion that has come against you that
1:08:35
