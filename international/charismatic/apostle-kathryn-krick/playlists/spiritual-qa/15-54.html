Your heart
0:00
how do you guard your heart
0:06
well your heart what God has done in your heart what he has released to you
0:13
like Revelation he has released Revelation about him who he is revelation about who you are your
0:22
identity in Christ you know that faith that uh Revelation that's
0:31
there in your heart that's come in your heart that's become your truth like for
0:37
example God has opened up your eyes to his how how he loves you so much and how
0:43
he has such great plans for you and how he never condemns you that's the truth that we should be
0:51
living in that's the truth that was revealed to us in our heart and removed every other bad thing in our heart every
0:58
other lie that the enemy had put in before that Revelation
1:04
came so that that has become your truth that you live by right and and also
1:11
about who you are maybe before God revealed to you the truth of who you are in Christ maybe you thought badly about
1:19
yourself maybe you thought you weren't good enough maybe you believed words that people spoke about you but but now
1:27
God has wiped that away with the Revelation that he's given you through
1:33
his word through encounters you've had with him where he revealed his
1:39
love uh through prophetic words sometimes how he's spoken how he sees you and your
1:45
future right so like those those parts are a big part of your heart like like
1:53
the truth the Revelation that God's given you about who he is and about who you are and about your future about your
1:58
relationship with God that's a big part of your heart that's like the core of your heart and so like when you have
2:06
when you keep your faith in those things when you keep walking in that truth your the faith of who God is and how God sees
2:13
you and your relationship and your future when you walk in that truth
2:19
that's how you'll have Victory that's how you'll be able to be who God called you to be you have to have faith in
2:25
those things or else you'll fall short you won't really be able you have the
2:30
confidence and the energy and strength and power to step into who you were called to be so your future is shaped
2:40
by your faith your beliefs what you're thinking about what you're meditating on
2:45
is your truth so like that's your heart that's a big part of your heart and also what's part of your heart is is the the
2:53
blessings God has given you of peace and of Joy Godly confidence
3:02
contentment these things God's given you it's he's released that to you and you
3:09
live in that daily well the enemy would love
3:14
to taint any of those aspects of your heart because if you can taint any of
3:20
those aspects the devil can then alter your future if you're allowing him to so
3:28
that's pretty much a summary of like what's going on in your heart so that's
3:34
what you have to guard you have to know what you're guarding right so guarding your heart is talking about protecting
3:41
what God has revealed to you is truth you have accepted you have chosen
3:48
to believe this is my truth and also the blessings he's released to you in your
3:54
heart of Peace of Joy um Godly confidence you know confidence in who
4:01
you are in Christ and that God loves you um and he's always with you and protecting you you have to protect these
4:07
things these aspects of your heart and so like what that looks like is the
4:13
devil would want to lie to you lie to you in your mind lie to you through circumstances lied to you through people's words to try to uh taint your
4:24
heart to try to diminish the Peace of your heart diminish the the joy en Joy
4:30
the contentment of your heart diminish your Godly confidence in your heart diminish how you see God and how God
4:36
sees you that truth that you have in your heart so that that is the big meaning of
4:44
it of that's what you're guarding and so the way you guard your heart is well
4:49
number one the message I shared a couple Sundays ago treasure your freedom
4:55
treasure all of that treasure all of that that God has given you in your heart all that you've received from him
5:01
all the Revelation you've received from him treasure that know that you have to protect that you have to guard that you
5:07
have to guard your heart or you could lose that so the big way you guard your
5:13
heart is by um any lie that contradicts your TR the truth that God has given you
5:21
you have to be diligent to reject those lies to take the thoughts captive to Christ that don't align with Jesus
5:30
with his word and another big way of guarding your heart well guarding your
5:37
heart so much is having to do with not allowing wrong words to enter so much
5:45
through your ears and everything so a big part of guarding your heart is the relationships you keep like the enemy
5:51
can sometimes try to send one person in your life to constantly try to seal your peace so
5:56
you're constantly just bothered and constantly distracted that's a scheme sometimes of
6:02
the enemy bringing in a certain person in your life so that's so when I talk when I talk about uh the importance of
6:08
having boundaries in relationships and only bringing the people whom God has called you to bring
6:14
in close I'm teaching so much so much of that the point of that why you're doing
6:19
this is guarding your heart so if you're keeping the wrong people close if you're not having boundaries you're not
6:25
guarding your heart because the wrong people close
6:30
that's the biggest way to let the peace leave you allow the peace to allow peace to leave you is by bringing the wrong
6:38
people in close also your passion and your fire by the way that's another aspect of your heart that you're
6:43
protecting your childlikeness your humility your passion for Jesus and his
6:51
Revival like that's so precious the how you've conformed to God's will in your
6:57
heart how your heart has conformed to God's heart how your heart has become after God's heart you have to protect
7:05
that so the fire you carry is so precious the passion you carry is so
7:10
precious um the Zeal the childlikeness so precious and you have to protect that
7:18
you have to protect your humility as well like if you know people start to
7:24
speak against you and speak false accusations towards you there can be that temptation to that rises up of I
7:30
got to defend myself how dare they do they know they don't know me and they don't they don't know what I've been
7:36
doing for God and what I've sacrificed and when your mind starts going there
7:42
you're not guarding your heart in the aspect of humility the humility you carry is precious so make sure that that
7:50
humility is remaining in your heart if people start to you listen to
7:56
Pharisees so much their words you are not guarding your heart in the area of
8:01
childlike faith and you're not guarding your heart in the area of the precious Covenant
8:08
that God has made known to you like I shared in the service this past Sunday
8:14
the precious Revelations God released to you you know don't allow the the pearls that God
8:22
has given you to be to be Spilled Out don't let them be Lo lost because you're
8:29
listening to swine says don't give your pearls to swine don't let swine take your
Maintaining deliverance
8:37
pearls you need to watch my maintaining your deliverance videos they're on my YouTube I answer this question in depth
8:45
one of the big schemes of the enemy once once Deliverance has come once healing has come one big scheme of the enemy is
8:51
to try to make you think you didn't really receive it or that it's come back the enemy uh God can actually allow the
8:59
enemy me to test you in this area like test your faith will you believe that
9:04
you really have received and will you step up to the plate of being a good soldier in Christ
9:13
and will you do the spiritual work which is rejecting the devil's lies and declaring I am healed I am freed I know
9:19
Jesus has healed me I know Jesus has freed me and so I claim my healing this
9:26
can never come back this oppression can never come back the sickness can never come back the Bible says submit to God
9:33
resist the devil and he must flee submit to God's word to sub submit to God's truth he has healed You by his stripes
9:40
you are healed you know that that has happened submit to that truth resist the
9:46
devil resist the lies he's bringing which sometimes come in the form of fake manifestations which sometimes come in the form of symptoms like you used to
9:54
have when you were bound but you're no longer bound now they're fake they're not real it's the devil
10:00
uh tempt trying to tempt you to to to accept his portion again and and and
10:06
bring the oppression or sickness back so you resist those lies reject those lies I I reject every attack of the enemy I
10:14
reject any sickness and this oppression it is gone from my life and it cannot
10:19
come back I am healed the Bible says he must flee he must flee that's a
10:25
principle that's a law you need to trust God's word that when you do these things when you submit to God resist the devil
10:31
the devil has no choice but to to flee he has to flee it's a law in the kingdom
10:37
of God it's a principle in the kingdom of God it's a promise from
10:43
God uh so once again make sure you watch my YouTube channel how to receive and
10:50
maintain complete deliverance it's on my YouTube it's four
10:56
messages of s of strictly how to maintain your deliverance and I go over
11:02
that scheme in depth I remember Steve actually had a testimony of this Steve
11:07
the one who plays guitar at 5f church he has a powerful testimony of this that he had he had insomnia for many many many
11:15
years he and then God delivered him at 5f church when we were in the park and
11:22
from that night he had the best sleep he's ever had in his whole life I believe it was and so for a long time
11:28
for me months he slept perfectly sound and then all of a sudden he was
11:34
struggling to sleep again so he applied this biblical principle that I've taught
11:39
that I just shared he rejected the devil's lies and the trouble sleeping went away
11:47
completely the devil had to flee and since then he's sleeping amazingly every night traveling
11:55
doing at to flourish conferences different time zones having no issue even adjusting with the time zone and everything having so much
12:02
energy so um that's a real testimony actually of
12:07
here at 5f church so praise God be
12:13
encouraged you are free you are truly free you are truly healed the devil has to flee Gina maybe
12:20
you guys maybe you all remember this she shared her testimony right after flourish I don't know exactly when the
12:25
eyes she first experienced healing with her eyes but the blurry vision tried to come back and she kept rejecting it and
12:31
it completely went away the ways the enemy was trying to bring blurry vision back it completely went away so this is
12:37
you know this is actually normal this is I mean that's why the Bible says we're
12:43
in a spiritual war that's why the Bible says resist the devil and he must flee
12:49
the Bible is telling us what to do if the Bible's not just like telling us this for no reason the word of God gives
12:55
us this instruction because we'll need it that's powerful you know when you
13:00
read the word of God differently like that like this is powerful this is so powerful this is what I need God knows I
13:07
would need that this isn't just words this is my life Source this is the the the road map to complete healing Freedom
13:15
maintaining that healing and freedom Hallelujah would love to hear how your journey of starting to speak
13:21
prophetically into others lives and how it first looked and felt well I my eyes
13:27
open up to the prophetic and the power power of God all in one year like my eyes open up to the power of God the prophetic the bapti the Holy Spirit I
13:33
was bapti the Holy Spirit healing Deliverance demons being cast out my eyes opened up bful ministry my eyes
13:39
opened up to all of that Apostles prophets my eyes opened up to all of that within like a month or something um
13:46
and so that so so that was about about yeah one year a little less
13:53
than one year before I received the prophecy over my life and uh from my
13:59
spiritual father now Prophet Jord Avey it was about one it was it was less than one year before that it on Thanksgiving
14:06
time it was um about one year before that where my eyes first started opening where I just I started to
14:14
see God move and in in the power and be baptized in the Holy Spirit and everything and the prophetic
14:20
experiencing the prophetic and experiencing the first prophetic words and then experiencing going to different
14:25
places where people were prophesying and looking back some of those were angel of Light prophecies because people didn't
14:31
know how to prophesy in order but anyways um my eyes opened up to that and then
14:38
when I would see people prophesy I was like whoa like that's wild and how do
14:45
they do that how do they see how do they hear from God I mean I didn't hear
14:52
anything I didn't see anything for someone else I was really Amazed by that
14:58
the the Prof a gift actually it was just such a mystery to me it was just like
15:03
whoa you know but then I I received a
Prophetic anointing
15:08
prophecy from my spiritual father that I was called to be an apostle of Jesus
15:13
Christ and some of the things he prophesied to me was that God was calling me to walk in the prophetic
15:20
anointing um he is a prophet and I would and I knew I'd be receiving the anointing from the prophet so I I would
15:27
be prophetic and that what God call was calling me to do was to minister in the
15:33
prophetic in the prophetic and Apostolic so I knew that and I remember hearing that prophecy and I was like
15:40
whoa how like it it just seemed like farfetched it just you know but I
15:46
trusted God and um then I had been receiving impartation
15:52
from my spiritual father and I started fold Church nine months
15:57
after receiving the prophecy that I was called to be an apostle and first me my spiritual father and then
16:04
nine months a after having church weekly I wasn't
16:10
seeing much manifestation of God's power I wasn't I wasn't seeing anything prophetically that I could
16:16
recognize and I was pretty much just preaching and I would pray for people one by one just simp simple prayers uh
16:25
but I didn't see really manifestation of God's power but then God had called me to to go to my spiritual father's Church
16:32
in Tanzania I had been many times prior but he called me to go this would have been I think the first time going since
16:40
I had started the church I think if I'm thinking right and so this
16:46
was this was now nine months after I started the church I went around nine months I went to my spiritual father's
16:52
Church in Tanzania East Africa and I came so expectant to
16:57
receive impartation and I was so hungry for the power of God
17:02
to move at my church to touch people in LA because I had seen my spiritual father Minister many times I'd gone to
17:10
his church many times and I was in awe with how God's power touched people and I really and I KN I hadn't seen that in
17:16
America I had seen it in that I hadn't seen it in that level and so I knew God's plan I knew God's plan was like
17:23
that same way God was moving so powerfully through my spiritual father that God wanted to move that way in America and through me but at that point
17:30
it was kind of hard for me to really let that enter my heart I was just believing
Why I came to America
17:36
but it was hard for me to really like grasp it you know because I hadn't seen any manifestations of God's power move
17:42
through me so at this point I was going Abram to Abraham and I felt way more
17:47
closer to Abram than Abraham you know like the new me like who got had call me
17:53
to be uh a powerful anointed servant of God so I just looked up to my spiritual
18:00
father so much and I was just like I wish you could come and just minister in America cuz it I humbly just couldn't
18:07
see myself ministering like my spiritual father like in a humble way you know so
18:12
I was just like I wish you could come I wish God could lift you I wish God could make your ministry known more that was
18:19
my heart so much simply because I wanted the people in America and all over the
18:24
world to experience this this power of God like I had experienced moving
18:30
through him and at his church so anyways I came really hungry I had been ministering for 9 months and not really
18:37
seeing the power of God move and just hungering knowing like here in Tanzania they're experiencing the power of God so
18:44
mightily people were being healed of cancer and then they're becoming Apostles and healing others of cancer by
18:49
God's power this is amazing people are being delivered from all kinds of
18:54
demonic oppressions I want this in America I want this LA and Beyond um but at that time my
19:02
eyes were mostly on La in America um wasn't thinking that big yet about the whole world but um so then I I
19:11
came so hungry so hungry to receive impartation and I received impartation
19:17
he poured o oil upon my head and spoke over me and I fell back with God's power
19:22
and two of his spiritual children one was an apostle one is a prophet they both walk in the power of God so
19:28
mightily and Minister during the week at his
19:34
church and um they brought me to the airport and they're like your ministry
19:39
when you start to minister now everything's going to be different this is what happened for us you know um
19:45
you'll see you'll see and I was things are going to happen Miracles will take
19:50
place the prophetic will move and I was like what really yeah I was so amazed
19:57
and so excited then I got on the plane and I was so set on fire like never
20:02
before I was reading the word and the Word was coming alive like never before had to come alive and I was praying and
20:09
reading the Bible the whole like 24 something hour trip I was just on fire
20:14
like never before and so hungry for God to move in power in La at my church so I
20:20
was I remember just getting dressed for church that Sunday and just being so
20:26
expectant and so hungry and so on fire and um I preached and after I preached I
20:33
called people to The Altar and Jean's mom but it was before Jean tall came to our church Jean tall's parents came
20:39
first so Jean tall's mom came I think it was her second time coming I think and I touched my hand on her hand and she fell
20:46
back with God's power and that was the first manifestation of God's power that I had seen at my church like God moving
20:54
through me so prophetic as it was shant tall's mom wow um of all people so then
21:01
I started praying for another person and as I started praying the prophetic anointing Came Upon me for the first time it was just this like simple
21:08
knowing I wasn't seeing anything I wasn't hearing anything it was just this simple knowing I just prayed and just words
21:15
kind of came out uh like just a knowing and just I think I was praying something
21:20
about something someone's past something they went through and they're just weeping and then I go and pray for
21:26
another person and the same thing happens and they weeping that was the first time and it it just grew from
21:33
there every time since that Sunday that's how it started so it was
21:38
completely impartation it was completely impartation and not forcing God and you
21:47
know not trying to force it trying just allowing God's timing to to Reign is
Spiritual principles and laws
21:55
there a teaching about the spiritual principles and laws yes I do have a teaching on my YouTube called I think
22:02
it's called laws in the spiritual realm I think it's called that if you search
22:08
Katherine Crick laws in the spiritual realm I think it'll pop up I I remember I think
22:15
I'm wearing a maroon jacket and we're in the park how did you learn to Value yourself
22:23
after receiving the prophecy from Prophet Jord Davy so I think she's referring to when I receiv received the
22:29
prophecy that I was called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ I was called to reach the Nations this prophecy he also
22:35
my spiritual father Prophet J DAV also gave a directional word on top of that he said I see that your heart has a lot
22:42
of scars from men and you need to Value yourself a little bit to see what I
22:49
prophesied come to pass um and so I would
22:55
say what happened was like ever since I
23:02
was well when I was young it's amazing my I'm my mom's only like natural child
23:11
I have a half sister and a half brother for my dad's previous marriage and they're way older than me and so I grew
23:17
up the life of an only child and um the way my parents treated
23:24
me they treated me as if I was very special and so I I really see it was just
How God prepared me for rejection
23:33
amazing how God prepared me to see that I was valuable and special and set
23:42
apart like so that I could have the confidence that I need The Godly confidence I need and not have
23:48
insecurity you know for what I what I'm called to do now I can see that it happened even at a young age and then
23:55
even in my even in my like like as a teen and as
24:03
a as a pre-teen as a teen and as a college kid I was I ended up being lukewarm stepping into the world a
24:09
little bit in my Teena teenager years but even through those
24:15
times I it's like I had a knowing that my heart was different towards God like
24:22
I had I noticed that I had like other Christians I was around even though I
24:27
was like living kind of luk warm I had such a fire for God like passion for God
24:33
um that I could tell was different like I wanted to talk about God more than
24:38
everyone else wanted to talk about God um I never wanted to miss
24:43
church I was going to church twice a week through my college Years even
24:49
though I wasn't like fully surrendered at that point because I needed God's power to help me fully surrender but the passion was there so I I always had this
24:57
like knowing that I had a different heart for God a special heart for God and that God wanted to use me in a
25:03
special way I didn't wasn't thinking a minister but I always kind of like had
25:08
that kind of like knowing from God God had prepared me and then just when
25:15
people did disvalue me like men did disvalue me and um I had like got I
25:21
would say quite a bit of rejection I never really thought about it like that but I would say some rejection from
25:26
specifically men or you know and it's like when the prophet my spiritual
25:34
father prophesied this it's like my eyes opened up like they treated you wrongly
25:41
you were valuable and they shouldn't have treated you that way you know where before that didn't
25:48
click yet I think before I was kind of like oh is there something like I don't know why I'm being disvalued or I didn't
25:56
even really see I'm being disvalued like is there something wrong with me like those are probably more of the thoughts
26:02
that I would have rather than be like they're not worth my time like you
How God opened my eyes
26:09
know in a humble way you know like I don't need to worry about them if they don't want to treat me nice like that
26:15
that's not the one for me you know I wasn't that way and so like even before
26:22
I had the call of ministry I really believe that God was calling me to be a Christian singer and I believe I just
26:28
had this faith that God was really going to open up doors that I would be a
26:34
Christian singer and God could use me to share about how my eyes open had opened up to
26:40
his power and his love through this like I had this faith that I was going to be
26:46
special in God's Kingdom in that area you know and so I had been forgetting
26:51
that a bit when I was going through this
26:58
actually I kind of like forgot like lost sight that I was called to something
27:03
special and I was valuable and precious and don't have time to be
27:11
chilling with people who are disv valuing you know it's like bringing me down right instead of helping me be
27:17
where I'm supposed to be and go forward and so when that word was spoken my eyes really opened up like oh
27:25
wow I was being disvalued and this man like shouldn't have been in my life like
27:32
if they were going to disvalue you know that my eyes really opened up there and
27:37
so with that prophetic word you know and now that word was like you're called to be an apostle to reach the Nations like
27:44
this word was like it Amplified the value and
27:50
specialness that God had already like spoke to me I really Amplified it and
27:56
the fear of God came with that word he was like to get to what I have prophesied you need to Value
28:02
yourself so it was a fear of God like oh yes like I need okay I don't want to
28:09
mess this up I better value myself and honestly it became really easy it was just simply God opened my eyes and he
28:17
opened my eyes and I was like and I was able to see how he saw me you know I was able to see that I didn't know how I was
28:24
going to be an apostle but I just believed I just accepted it you know I just accepted I'm
28:31
called to be this chosen set aart special
28:36
person okay so I have to see myself that way I have to I I have to see myself
28:41
with value if other people don't see it I have to you know keep that truth in me
28:47
you know that's how and um so just you know
28:54
really believe in the prophets the Bible says believe in the prophets and you'll prosper ER so honestly I God touched me
29:01
through that word and I believe that word and I held on to that word and I value that word and I didn't have to do
29:06
anything else like I just I believed in the prophets and I prospered I believed in that prophet and I prospered I I
29:13
prospered in that area like the ability to Value
29:18
myself which leads me to be able to fulfill my my purpose just never let it leave my heart
Advice for ministers
29:26
I didn't have to do any like intentional work to Value myself from that moment I just carried that word in my
29:32
heart advice for ministers on not growing weary well the first thing that comes to
29:39
mind is I encourage you to watch my teachings regularly if you don't
29:45
already because uh in so many of my teachings I have so much encouragement for ministers
29:53
for all I mean just because my story and my testimony is that I was called to be
29:59
an apostle and I didn't want to be a minister but it was just out of obedience and so it was really
30:04
uncomfortable to go up go up there and preach for about three years for three years I did not look forward to Sundays
30:10
I mean I was spiritually happy for people to be touched in some way but I
30:17
was so uncomfortable preaching it was so out of my comfort zone that I didn't look forward to Sundays it was just pure
30:22
obedience and I was so excited when it was Monday cuz it meant that it was a
30:28
whole week until Sunday again I mean it was just that uncomfortable for me to preach it was just so out of my comfort
30:35
zone and um our church had 20 the first year then it dwindled down to 15 the
30:42
next year and then it became to down to 10 the next year then down to five the next year so on top of that there wasn't
30:48
a lot of encouragement uh you know that what I was doing was
30:54
um doing much and was blessing people I believed I chose to believe Jean tall
31:00
and I remember her father would regularly encourage me that the word really blessed them but it was just one
31:06
to two people usually that would share with me that the word I preached blessed
31:12
them so me showing up every week to preach for three and a half years getting
31:19
smaller and smaller each year with only one to two people encouraging me and one of them was John tall who was not only
31:25
my spiritual daughter but my best friend she she was the only one to encourage me every single week but um you know that just wasn't
31:35
exciting so it was pure obedience I I was expectant for Revival but there was
31:40
no signs of it breaking out it was no signs of the word coming to pass soon but I just believed and I just
31:48
obeyed you know and so um we literally got smaller and smaller with each year
31:54
for three and a half years down to literally two and then Co hit so that was even that was more discouraging we
31:59
couldn't meet in our physical building people were afraid to come to church to be around
32:05
people and so I remember it was three and a half years of waiting for the the promise of Revival to break out and it
32:10
felt like the opposite like oh wow now people don't even want to come to church because they're
32:16
afraid you know and then um then we started having church outside and only two people came and I'll never forget
32:21
when one September September in the year 2020 I preached to one person it was
32:28
something degree weather and we had Church anyways sweating our faces off and um I preached to one person that
32:34
just showed up in the park and they left in the middle of the in the middle of my message that was the year 2020 but it
32:40
just kept going just because all that matters is obedience to God all that matters all that matters that's just what I kept in My Heart all that matters
32:46
is to do what God wants me to do all that matters is to touch his heart I'm doing this for the audience of one this
32:52
is my secret place God sees this he he's proud of me he's I'm touching his heart through doing these things that are
32:58
difficult they're making this sacrifice that's what kept me going strong is just
33:03
wanting to touch God's heart and and believing that it was touching God's heart and there was nowhere else I wanted to be but in his
33:09
will and I knew not doing this would be out of his will not showing up to minister every week and giving my all
33:17
that would be out of his will I I knew that simple fact so it it just was simple I just had I just had to keep
33:23
going and I just believe that my God is not a liar he is faithful and so that promise will come to pass it absolutely
33:31
will come to pass and he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek after him and all these seeds I'm sewing they will
33:38
they will come to harvest and they absolutely did and so I ministered to that one person who left and they left
33:45
in the middle of the sermon and then just months later Revival broke out all of a sudden the floodgates of the
33:50
anointing just God just decided to move I wasn't seeing hardly any Miracles now tons of miracles on one one minute video
33:56
and it went viral and two months later Deliverance happens for the first time the first demon manifest and was cast out and then a couple
34:03
months later the church grows from 20 people to now 300 in two months and
34:09
people have traveled from across the world since then everything happened so fast all of a sudden it was so slow for so long and then all of a sudden the
34:15
walls of Jericho came down crashing and everything changed my life changed and
34:21
the promise was fulfilled and God exceeded my expectations of his
34:26
faithfulness and and the promise being fulfilled he exceeded them so um anyways number one I talk
34:35
about my story a lot throughout my messages some of you have heard this story millions of times but um it's I
34:42
know it really has anointing on it to lift people up from being weary um and
34:48
and encourage you so I just I just pray that you are encouraged by this word and that the fire of God the passion to
34:56
serve him ignites more in you from now and that you would not be weary anymore
35:02
but you would be strong and steadfast in Jesus name so just know that God sees
35:08
everything and nothing's a waste nothing is a waste nothing is a waste so many
35:14
times when we're weary because we're not seeing the promise come to pass yet and it just feels mundane same old thing is
35:19
what I'm doing matter doesn't matter God sees it all everything is a
35:25
seed and it Harvest time is different than planning time you're just in planning time now you got to remember
35:31
that you will see fruit from what you have sowed you have
35:38
to it's a law in the spiritual realm you will see it God is
35:43
faithful amen oh and also I want to add to that
35:49
Minister and this is for everybody um God lifts The
God lifts the humble
35:56
Humble God lifts The
36:02
Humble he rewards those who are humble
36:09
and I mean I was just like a nobody I was just a no I was I mean not nobody
36:17
but I was I was a normal just a normal
36:22
person and um public speaking was my biggest fear and weakness I wasn't just
36:27
like great speaker like it didn't make sense to be where I am now uh like in the world's way but what
36:36
I've learned is that there's no limits to what God will do with a humble
36:41
heart humble heart in this in this day among
36:48
Christians I found is pretty rare I found it's pretty
36:56
rare and I've seen certain people like in my life in in in my Ministry and I've
37:02
seen God lift them and use them
37:07
powerfully and they were just normal people too but it was because of their
37:13
humility and God wants you to see how valuable
37:20
you are I talked a little bit earlier about you know the importance of seeing your value
37:28
you know if you're if you're humble and pure in heart like because you can know when you
37:35
are I mean you can know when like when you don't have
37:43
this desire for people to see you and look important and or maybe the thought
37:50
comes but you don't like it if you don't like that thought that doesn't that means you're humble I mean because the devil can send those thoughts the devil
37:57
send those thoughts like oh wow like you'll look really important and successful or whatever you know the
38:04
devil absolutely wants to send those thoughts so that he's trying to get you to accept them and then become prideful
38:12
so but what I mean is like when you like deep down your heart your heart deep
38:18
down just wants to please God and to be in his will and you don't care what that
38:24
looks like for your life you know what whatever you have to do behind the scenes in front of the scenes you just
38:30
want God's will to be done and it grosses you out to take Glory
38:35
from God like you know like you just want God to have the glory and like you don't want
38:43
to take false credit you don't want to you don't want to like project yourself as so
38:51
amazing you know like if that's not in your heart you're humble and that's rare
38:59
today and the humble ones really need to Value themselves and see how God needs
39:06
you and see that God has such amazing plans to use
39:11
you because this is the era of David's
39:17
being anointed it's been an era of not that for a while but it's an era now in this
39:24
revival of the ones who are truly after God's heart s being the anointed ones being
39:30
leaders yeah so there is just a question like that said if you're a minister how
39:35
do you keep from being weary and so I just wanted to encourage you to see your value and see that you're so important
39:44
and God absolutely you're not going to have a mundane normal life you know you
39:50
boring life like God wants to anoint you God wants to use you in his power he
39:57
wants to lift you for his glory he wants to make you be a leader in some
40:02
capacity um because your humble heart is needed and is valuable anyone on this
40:08
Earth who has a humble heart is so valuable because it's rare today and people follow example of
40:16
others that's how so the way we change the world is by Humble ones stepping up
40:22
being leaders and being surrendered to God so God can actually lift you and and
40:28
use you so people can see you and make your make your star Shine the brightest
40:34
so people can be able to see you and follow your example so have value for
40:39
yourself and see that you're special see that your humble heart God's not going to let go to waste he he's going to use
40:46
you powerfully because of your heart that's so needed in this Earth today in the body of Christ today to bring change
40:53
to lead people to Jesus to anoint God not going to anoint people who don't have Humble Hearts you have to
41:00
have a humble Pure Heart to truly carry this anointing I really encourage you I
41:06
know it's really prophetic that I'm speaking this right now that I
41:11
shared in the beginning the testimony of the importance of me valuing myself my
41:18
spiritual father he said in order to get to what I prophesied for you you need to
41:23
Value yourself so imagine that that the word of God saying that if I didn't value
41:29
myself if I didn't believe that God was calling me to great things and to act
41:36
accordingly you know to not give into doubt to not give into the discouragement of the Wilderness times
41:44
that you can feel to not give into people persecuting me and saying I'm
41:49
wrong and I'm misguided or whatever or I'm deceived whatever nonsense people
41:54
are saying you know if I didn't do if I were to do all those things like give
42:00
into all those things doubt give to what people were
42:06
saying give up not value not think that I had God had great plans for
42:12
me I wouldn't be we wouldn't be here today we would not be here today because literally the prophet of God God spoke
42:19
through the prophet and said I wouldn't Reach This I wouldn't be who God called
42:25
me to be if I didn't value myself so guess what the same is true for you
42:31
the same is true for you and in that place when I received that word I was such a normal average Joe
42:39
person I was not who I am now and I had like no ability at least I thought to
42:47
speak publicly to preach to have Revelation from
42:54
God so if you see yourself as a average Joe person like that know that it's very
43:02
important you value yourself and see yourself see see yourself now like as
See yourself
43:09
Abram you need to see yourself as Abraham you need to see that you are going someplace much higher than where
43:14
you are now that God's calling you to be a leader that God wants to do great things through you much greater than
43:20
what he's doing now if he's already doing great things for you now he wants to do so much
43:25
greater you ought to to believe that in a humble way a Godly confidence humble way that God is counting on you to see
43:34
yourself how he sees you amen when we go into the world and have
43:43
jobs in the world it's important we're respecting Authority and you know the
43:52
authority in the workplace now of course if this is different if it's like the workplace is trying to get
44:01
you to denounce your faith or something or um going to a workplace that's doing
44:07
criminal things you shouldn't work there but in general like most workplaces are
44:13
like neutral places where like teaching in a school or working at the post
44:19
office or working at a restaurant like things like this so [Music]
44:24
um the people in the world they don't understand the things of the Spirit uh
44:30
so we just have to know that and know that it's okay like we don't we're not
44:35
really called to like completely like it's not our authority to bring all of
44:40
our Doctrine and everything and put it upon people that's not our place of
44:46
authority because people have free will in general just keeping your heart to do what is respectful to people and what
44:52
makes people feel respected and loved because people don't understand spiritual things so that's why you just
44:59
have to keep in your heart do what's making people feel respected and loved you don't need to feel pressure because
45:06
sometimes we can feel pressure as if we were supposed to turn where we're working into complete church but we have
45:12
to understand it's not our Spiritual Authority our job is to be the light and be attractive so people want to come and
45:18
meet Jesus Through us so that they want to come have relationship with us ask us questions um sense our love sense
45:25
something different about us so that they want ask us questions about our life or something that leads us to share about
45:31
Jesus that maybe will lead to us praying for them lead to you praying for the person if they share that they're
45:36
oppressed you know or just simply invite them to church like that's our role in the workplace that's our role that's
45:43
simply Your Role nothing else is to be the light and when people are attracted to you you you you you're planting seeds
45:51
and you minister to them when they in their own free will come to you and desire to be ministered too but many
45:58
times people feel the pressure to be a minister in the workplace and like force
46:03
Church Upon people and force their Doctrine upon people we're not supposed to do that we're called to be the light
46:10
and we got to respect people's Free Will amen how do I be the light to people when being when being not a natural
46:17
talker SL a quiet person so being a quiet person isn't
46:24
necessarily A Bad Thing really uh I would say that most people
46:30
need to go through a transformation in this area either they're too quiet or too talkative for selfish reasons right
46:39
so there could be some people that really don't like to talk but it's out of selfishness like maybe or
46:44
laziness um so that's that's an area that you know God wants to transform you
46:49
and lead you to be selfless and so that like when God wants to speak through you
46:55
to encourage somebody he can do it that you're ready that you're listening that you're listening to the Holy Spirit but
47:02
then there's some people who are who are naturally talkative but that can actually be not really completely
47:09
spirit-led it can be maybe a person so talkative in a selfish way like they like to hear themselves talk it makes
47:15
themselves feel heard it makes them maybe it makes them feel more connected to a person so they're doing it for like how they feel because of them talking
47:22
how they feel that's the purpose that's the heart behind why they're talking so much so that's also an area where God
47:29
wants to transform you um to be a good listener and to be speaking with intention so in general when we speak
47:36
when we converse it should be with intention and be with purpose not that we have to only be talking like
47:43
completely spiritual things all the time we can be talking about other things too you know not not like carnal worldly
47:50
things but um my point is is it doesn't need to sound like a sermon every time you're talking with a person with a
47:56
friend I don't mean that but like just to have in your heart like I don't want to talk just to talk I don't want to I
48:03
don't want to go into the default of talking because it feels good that's what I mean that's really what I mean so
48:10
I don't mean that you need to be like paranoid like is what I'm saying like super purposeful enough I don't mean it
48:17
in that way I just mean getting out of that habit of talking because it feels good or talking just to talk Talking um
48:25
cuz in a selfish way really you know um but
48:31
sometimes to talk about things like the weather or something it's making someone
48:37
feel connected to start the conversation or something so that's good my point is when you
48:43
engage with people when you have conversations with people have your mind on listening to
48:50
the Holy Spirit on being the light so what does that
48:55
look like it looks like being a good listener being a good listener it looks
49:02
like being ready to encourage somebody because a lot of times people are going to need encouragement a lot of times
49:09
especially if it's like people in the world co-workers or something they're probably having issues that's going on
49:14
in their life and that's what they want to talk about so be ready to encourage
49:19
them use this opportunity to be the light and bring hope to someone that's
49:25
going to plant a seed that's going to make that them like want to open up more to you that can allow more seeds to be
49:32
planted that'll lead to a harvest Hallelujah so yeah just to have that on your heart Lord how do you want to use
49:39
me in this moment in this conversation as a listener as one who pours into
49:45
somebody just encourages them um is just being the light and sometimes you don't
49:51
need to say much maybe a person's like really talkative and so you don't even say anything but you're a good listener
49:58
and you're engaged with them and you're on your face you showing like that you're listening and
50:06
you know that is showing love too amen I have a whole teaching on this
Your star
50:13
on my YouTube your star I think it's called your star if you type in Apostle
50:19
Katherine your star I have a whole teaching that explains this in
50:24
depth yes Hal Hallelujah but it's having to do with um Jesus had a star in the
50:31
sky but also in the spiritual realm that brought favor upon him it led to people bringing
50:37
favor and and blessings upon him and so we have the favor of God in our lives
50:43
but it can be seen as actually in the spiritual realm a star like we have a a
50:48
star spiritually meaning just the favor of God that comes upon us because who we
50:53
are in Christ the doors that open for God's glory for God's
51:00
purposes and so that that place of doors
51:05
opening for God's glory and favor your star it can be stolen in the spiritual
51:12
Real by like witchcraft can be done sometimes where and that that's when a person is seeing all these Nos and this
51:19
is just something deep spiritually a reality of Witchcraft of what can happen
51:24
in the spiritual realm but when people are seeing they're getting all sorts of doors closed so many knows um it it is an an
51:33
indication sometimes that their star has been stolen so it can simply be restored by the power of God I declare the star
51:40
to be restored and it's just simply meaning the favor of God being restored
51:46
what makes there to be favor and doors to open for it to be restored it's just just a deeper spiritual um truth if the
51:55
co-workers talk unwanted conversations how do I avoid that situation and be a light to
52:00
them well in general like you're called to be a leader
52:06
and Abundant Life is being released upon your life that people in the world don't
52:12
have so people should see you and go wow they should see your star and Go whoo
52:18
you shine bright and this can look like in different aspects of your life this can look like your peace your joy your
52:25
resiliency your or um the way you handle situations the way you don't
52:32
get angry the way you don't get down when things don't go your way the way you love on your enemies you know things
52:40
like this if you're working with someone for example they'll they'll get to know you they'll really see who you
52:46
are and they'll admire you whether they whether they admit it or not they'll they'll they'll recognize there's
52:52
something Supernatural about you different and they'll see that they want what you have certain aspects when
52:58
you're really shining your light they'll see the peace you have and they'll be like I want that so you are becoming a
53:05
leader to them even if they are not a Christian yet you know even they want you you are seeing as
53:12
this like leader figure in their life if you're really shining your light if you're if you're really shining your
53:18
light and so anyways you're being watched like if
53:24
you aren't engaging with gossip and you're just being quiet people
53:30
notice and it's speaking a message whether they want to learn from it and follow that example or not it's at least
53:37
planning a seed when you don't say much like when you're not engaging in the
53:43
gossip I mean you can be sitting there and in depending on the situation just
53:49
listening you know with no judgment or anything just just simply listening
53:54
anyways it speaks a lot and um so if someone's speaking something negative over their lives like oh I just can't
54:02
believe the state of the country right now and this and that
54:08
and uh whatever just listen and they're not
54:13
exactly inviting you to say your opinion but it is a conversation this is a
54:19
moment at the end you can say something hopeful something hopeful everything will be okay everything will be okay
54:26
it'll work out God's in control you know man in the past we
54:32
thought things we thought um there's so much Doom and
54:37
Gloom feelings around like elections lately for example the past there's so
54:43
much Doom and Gloom and oh the world's going to end and it doesn't end God's still on the throne and um we're fine
54:53
you know you can share with them you know in the past we thought things were uh we were worried about things but look
54:59
it was all okay you know you can just speak something simply encouraging something of light something of Hope something simple at the end of when a
55:07
person is speaking this negative things and you're planning a seed in you're
55:12
being the light I'm going to declare over all of you God is going to release
55:18
more to you right now hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Jesus I declare right
55:25
now that every negative word that was spoken about you that was spoken about
55:30
your future I declare it to fall off of you every word curse be broken now in
55:36
jesus' name and every scheme of the enemy to try to keep you from seeing who you are
55:43
in Christ and your future how bright your future is I declare that to be removed from your life
55:50
now anything hindering you from from valuing yourself
55:56
from having Godly Confidence from walking in endurance
56:03
daily this must be removed from your life and I declare now that this
56:11
anointing would come upon you and your eyes would open up more to
56:16
see God's love for you to see how he sees you and to see your future adequately
56:24
rightly may you see the preciousness of your life the preciousness of your
56:31
heart and may you walk more in the fear of God in seriousness as a
56:37
leader like if you're not in the place of Abraham yet and you're in the place of Abram
56:43
more or you're closer to there may you start seeing yourself as Abraham may you start seeing yourself
56:52
differently God has such great plans for your life life because of your Humble Hearts he's
57:00
going to do powerful powerful things through you and he's counting on you let this
57:06
fear of God come in your heart more may you be filled with more passion
57:13
for Jesus and his kingdom and his people may you be filled with more joy more
57:19
peace more Abundant Life in Jesus name amen
