hi I'm Apostle Catherine Crick welcome
0:34
to another episode of Revival is now on
0:37
this episode you will learn how to
0:39
experience God's presence in your daily
0:42
life how to experience God's presence
0:45
well first of all when you give your
0:48
life to Jesus the Holy Spirit comes and
0:51
lives inside of you so that's God
0:55
himself makes his home
0:58
in your temple of your body if you've
1:01
given your life to Jesus
1:03
God lives in you right now
1:08
my earliest memory was age four my
1:11
parents asking me if I want to
1:12
officially accept Jesus in my heart in
1:16
my life as my Lord and Savior now and I
1:19
remember saying yes and
1:22
just saying a prayer repeating words
1:24
after them
1:25
and
1:27
from that day I have always known God
1:30
I've always loved God I've always had
1:32
faith in God there was never a day I
1:34
didn't doubt his existence or his love
1:37
for me but as I entered High School I
1:41
started hungering to have a relationship
1:45
with God I started hearing people talk
1:46
about having relationship with God and I
1:49
didn't really know what that meant I
1:51
just believed in God and had faith in
1:54
him and would say prayers you know
1:57
nightly at the dinner table and went to
2:00
church but that was about it I had Faith
2:03
but that was it then I started hearing
2:05
about relationship that you could have a
2:07
relationship with God
2:09
and and when I heard that I was like I
2:12
was hungry I was like I want that I want
2:14
to know God more intimately
2:17
so from there I was on a journey of
2:19
seeking God the Bible says that when you
2:21
seek God and seek him with all of your
2:24
heart then you will find him
2:27
so I thank God that he put a hunger in
2:30
me and that made me want to seek him
2:34
more so I could find him in his fullness
2:36
so fast forward into my mid-20s I
2:39
encountered the power of God for the
2:42
first time
2:43
meaning I saw people receive Miracles
2:46
people be healed people be delivered I
2:49
received prophetic words for the first
2:52
time in my life and instantly my eyes
2:55
open up like never before in the
2:58
spiritual realm to God's nearness and
3:01
his love
3:02
and his love for me intimately me and I
Baptism of the Holy Spirit
3:06
was and then I was baptized in the Holy
3:07
Spirit now in Acts 2 1 it says when the
3:10
day of Pentecost came they were all
3:11
together in one place suddenly a sound
3:14
like the blowing of a violent wind came
3:15
from heaven and filled the whole house
3:17
where they were sitting they saw what
3:18
seemed to be tongues of fire that
3:20
separated and came to rest on each of
3:22
them all of them were filled with the
3:24
Holy Spirit and began to speak in other
3:26
tongues as the spirit enabled them so
3:28
this is what happened to the original
3:29
disciples the Holy Spirit came upon them
3:33
in Fire and as you continue to read the
3:36
book of Acts there's other examples of
3:39
when the Holy Spirit came upon people
3:42
where they had been baptized in water
3:44
they believed in Jesus but they hadn't
3:47
had the Holy Spirit come upon them and
3:49
began speaking in new tongues so this
3:52
actually shows us that the baptism of
3:55
the holy spirit is separate and
3:57
different from the baptismal of water
3:58
and the baptism of the holy spirit is
4:01
something that God wants for every
4:02
single one of his believers
4:04
the baptism of the holy spirit is simply
4:08
more of holy spirit it's Holy Spirit
4:10
coming in fire it's Holy Spirit igniting
4:13
you igniting your spirit and its Holy
4:17
Spirit taking over more of you I when I
4:21
received about some Holy Spirit I was in
4:22
a place of just ready to surrender to
4:25
God just so hungry and so Desiring more
4:28
of him and ready to surrender my whole
4:29
life finally
4:31
and that's when it came that's when I
4:33
received it and when I received it I
4:37
began speaking in tongues
4:39
immediately speaking in Newton
4:43
and when that happened I it was like the
4:49
best thing that had ever happened to me
4:51
in my life I just I just my spiritual
4:54
eyes opened up and it's like I just knew
4:58
and loved God more than ever before I
5:02
could see his love clearly for me like
5:05
never before and just that Supernatural
5:07
Encounter of the baptism Holy Spirit it
5:10
just gave me this knowing
5:12
that God is
5:17
all-powerful he is so Majestic
5:21
he is the lord of the universe
5:25
and he loves me so much and he's so near
5:29
to me and he's with me right now giving
5:32
me a new tongue and it was just this
5:36
knowing I I believed all these things
5:39
before but this deep knowing Came Upon
5:42
me
5:43
and I was set on fire from that day my
5:48
spiritual eyes opened up the Revelation
5:49
in the spiritual realm that I had just
5:52
increased so much of God's love and who
5:54
he is and I've never been the same since
5:56
that day
5:57
and my love for God only grew my
5:59
surrender only grew so I'm sharing with
6:01
you right now how to experience God's
6:04
presence every single day
6:07
not just once in a while
6:10
um and first of all the first the first
6:13
thing I'm gonna the first part is to
6:15
give your life to Jesus and the Holy
6:18
Spirit will come and live inside of you
6:19
his presence is now in you right there
6:23
it right then and there
6:26
secondly
6:27
surrender to Jesus because many times
6:30
when people first give their lives to
6:31
Jesus it's like day one of believing day
6:35
one of deciding yes I want to make you
6:37
Lord Of My Life
6:39
but then as time goes on your love
6:43
increases in your Revelation increases
6:47
as you seek God more and get to know him
6:49
more until you get to a place where
6:52
your
6:54
ready and Desiring to surrender every
6:57
part of your life
6:59
there's a difference between saying
7:01
Jesus your lord of my life I believe you
7:04
and here you can take my life
7:07
there's a difference between that and
7:11
your eyes opening up more and more and
7:14
more until you're in your in the depths
7:17
of your heart you desire to give God
7:21
everything every part of your life your
7:25
will your dreams your plans your desires
7:29
your preferences everything
7:33
so many times and this was a this is
7:36
from my case the baptism of the holy
7:38
spirit it's a second in feeling of the
7:41
Holy Spirit and that comes when you're
7:43
ready to get everything and also when
7:47
you're unashamed of the Holy Spirit and
7:51
open and hungry for the baptism of the
7:55
Holy Spirit some of you like me did not
7:59
grow up knowing about that that's the
8:01
holy spirit so you have to get to a
8:03
place where your
8:05
your you have an open heart and you
8:07
don't have it uh anything holding you
8:10
back any like skepticism but you're just
8:13
like Lord I want more of you I want this
8:17
baptism the Holy Spirit that's when he
8:20
comes in Fire and baptizes you in his
8:22
spirit before I was baptized in the Holy
8:24
Spirit my revelation of God of his love
8:28
it was
8:29
it was so much smaller than what it was
8:32
after I was baptized in the Holy Spirit
8:33
and after I was baptized in the Holy
8:35
Spirit I was able to really
8:39
experience God's presence
8:43
so much so much more than before First
First Corinthians 2
8:46
Corinthians 2 4 says Paul says my
8:50
message and my preaching were not with
8:51
wise and perspective words but with a
8:52
demonstration of the spirit's power so
8:55
that your faith might not rest on human
8:56
wisdom but on God's power
8:59
so tall saying I didn't come to you
9:03
preaching without God's anointing God's
9:05
power in me I didn't come to you just
9:08
saying you should believe in Jesus and
9:10
this is why and okay are you ready to
9:13
read repeat a prayer after me and give
9:15
your life to Jesus he's saying no I
9:18
didn't do that but instead I was a
9:20
vessel who carried and carried anointing
9:22
carried the power of God and when I
9:24
spoke I spoke simply but the power of
9:27
God was there and was flowing through me
9:30
and touching the people and I
9:32
demonstrated the power of God
9:34
I baptized people in the Holy Spirit I
9:37
prophesied I cast out a demon I heal the
9:40
sick I release the anointing and people
9:44
experienced the power and presence of
9:48
God and so Paul's saying
9:52
so that your faith would not rest on
9:54
man's words but that your faith would
9:56
rest on God's power for me I had grown
10:00
up in church I went to church about at
10:03
least twice a week every week of my
10:04
whole life pretty much
10:06
and
10:07
my faith was rested on man's words
10:12
but I hadn't really had this tangible
10:15
real encounter where God became so real
10:19
and present to me rather than being far
10:22
away but I believe in him
10:25
and then I encounter God's power and he
10:27
became
10:29
so tangible when the baptism the Holy
10:32
Spirit came upon me I could literally
10:34
feel him for the first of my life
10:36
physically I mean like he was overtaking
10:39
my tongue that was Supernatural and that
10:43
was God
10:45
and that was the first I literally felt
10:48
him and that was the first time and so
10:51
like in that moment my faith became
10:53
rested on his power on God himself on my
10:58
experience my tangible experience
11:00
encounter I had with him rather than a
11:03
person talking about him
11:05
alone
11:07
so this is what we want this is what we
11:10
want we want people people should you
11:12
should be having your own encounters
11:14
with God so your faith is so strong and
11:17
is really based on relationship with God
11:20
the realness that you've really met him
11:23
and not just heard about him
11:25
what happens when you encounter God in
11:27
power
11:29
the baptism Holy Spirit
11:31
the power of God touches you you fall
11:33
back and you're healed you're delivered
11:36
a prophetic word
11:38
all these different ways that God comes
11:40
in power when you are touched like that
11:43
in power or you're just in a service for
11:45
example where the anointing's flowing
11:46
and you're touched and you're having a
11:48
tangible touch from God all of these
11:50
things they
11:52
open your eyes up in the spiritual realm
11:54
and it's like you they make you s it the
11:59
the the Encounters of God makes you
12:01
spiritual like it makes your faith real
12:05
it makes your faith big it makes you not
12:08
like this world and it changes you
12:10
forever one encounter with God's power
12:14
one encounter of God's power will change
12:18
you forever and ever
12:21
and it's like you don't even need you
12:23
don't need a prophetic word every day
12:24
you don't need a baptism the Holy Spirit
12:26
every day you don't need you don't need
12:29
to fall back with God's power every day
12:31
one time what could last you even a
12:36
lifetime I mean the change that it
12:37
brings the revelation of God's love and
12:40
nearness to you first of all once you
12:43
give your life to Jesus it's so
12:45
important for you to seek him more and
12:47
to
12:48
find where his power his anointing is
12:51
moving
12:51
position yourself to encounter his power
12:55
so that your spiritual eyes can open up
12:58
more so you can really meet
13:00
Jesus instead of just hear about him and
13:03
here's where you begin relationship with
13:06
him with someone you've really met and
13:09
really love and know that he loves you
13:12
so your faith has to rest on God's power
13:15
a real experience that's the first part
13:19
the second part is this
13:22
your relationship with God is based on
13:25
faith
13:27
your faith is based on God's power on
13:29
really meeting him encountering him
13:33
and then your relationship with God is
13:37
based on faith what I mean by that is
13:41
your relationships here on this Earth
13:44
are not based on faith your
13:46
relationships on this Earth are very
13:48
physical
13:50
now you can have spiritual relationships
13:52
but they're still physical and by that I
13:55
mean what what makes you feel close to a
13:57
person many times is having to do with
14:00
physical things like eye contact
14:03
a hug
14:05
audible voices but with god he's a
14:09
spirit
14:10
we don't see him physical or hear him
14:12
physical for the most part like we do
14:14
our relationships here on this Earth
14:16
your confidence in your relationships is
14:19
based on so many physical factors
14:21
hearing the audible voice of them speak
14:23
hugs seeing them in person
14:27
FaceTiming them what you have to
14:29
understand is that your relationship
14:31
with God is so so different from your
14:34
relationships on this Earth and before I
14:36
encountered the power of God
14:38
where I really met Jesus and my eyes
14:40
were opened up
14:42
I was insecure in my relationship with
14:45
God
14:46
I felt like I didn't know how to hear
14:48
his voice
14:50
I I I didn't feel close
14:54
and then all the while I would hear
14:56
other people say I heard God God told me
14:59
this God told me that
15:01
um so I would feel insecure about my
15:04
relationship with God I would feel
15:05
insecure like why don't I hear him
15:08
strongly am I not listening enough if
15:11
I'm not being quiet enough I would
15:13
wrestle with all of these thoughts
15:16
condemning thoughts um that it's my
15:18
fault that I'm not being a good enough
15:20
Christian and once my eyes opened up in
15:23
the spiritual Realm
15:25
God revealed to me that I was actually
15:27
projecting my relationships on Earth
15:30
upon God
15:32
and not realizing that they're so
15:34
different
15:35
you know God
15:37
chooses to not speak in an audible voice
15:39
most of the time there are some people
15:43
who who've heard his Audible Voice but
15:45
those who have heard of his Audible
15:46
Voice is usually just one or a couple
15:49
times so he doesn't usually speak an
15:51
audible voice and he also doesn't
15:53
usually appear physically he does
15:55
sometimes for specific purposes
15:58
but not to everybody and when it is to
16:01
people it's usually just one or maybe
16:03
two times that's it
16:05
so
16:06
this speaks something about God about
16:10
our relationship with him
16:13
that
16:14
you know it's not it's not hard for God
16:17
to speak to us audibly he could do it in
16:19
one second it's not hard for God to show
16:21
up
16:22
physically and just be with us
16:24
physically all the time he could do that
16:25
in one second
16:27
well why doesn't he do that
16:30
because our relationship with him is
16:33
based upon Faith he wants it that way
16:36
so after Jesus has resurrected and then
16:39
appeared to many of the disciples Thomas
16:41
didn't see Jesus and the other disciples
16:44
had and they told Thomas we have seen
16:47
the Lord but Thomas said to them unless
16:50
I see the nail marks in his hands and
16:52
put my finger where the nails were and
16:53
put my hand into his side I will not
16:56
believe a week later his disciples were
16:58
in the house again and Thomas was with
17:00
them through the doors though the doors
17:01
were locked Jesus came and stood among
17:03
them and said peace be with you then he
17:05
said to Thomas
17:08
then he said to Thomas
17:11
put your finger here see my hands reach
17:13
out your hand and put it into my side
17:15
stop doubting and believe Thomas said to
17:18
him my Lord and my God
17:21
then Jesus told them because you have
17:23
seen me you have believed blessed are
17:26
those who have not seen
17:28
and yet have believed
17:33
he calls those blessed
Faith
17:36
last
17:39
you cannot please God without faith
17:44
are
17:46
our relationship with God and how we
17:49
will be able to be the most powerful
17:51
vessel of God and fulfill our purpose on
17:53
this Earth is all based upon faith
17:57
faith faith faith is everything and we
18:01
can't cut corners
18:03
so our relationship with him is no
18:05
different
18:07
our relationship with God it builds our
18:11
faith the fact that it's based on faith
18:14
the fact that we can't see him
18:17
physically usually or hear him audibly
18:19
but have to believe and choose to
18:21
believe
18:23
that builds our faith and makes us
18:26
stronger spiritually so God can use this
18:28
even more powerfully I think you know
18:30
you you could ask yourself why doesn't
18:32
God just appear to us
Gods Presence
18:35
physically all the time and and audibly
18:38
speak to us why
18:40
and this is your answer here he says
18:42
blessed are you who believe without
18:44
seeing
18:46
so
18:47
if God chooses to appear to you and
18:50
speak to you that is so beautiful and
18:53
God will do that for a specific purpose
18:54
a reason why he wants to do that many
18:56
times is to build Faith many times is
18:58
because he's called something to some
18:59
he's called someone to something very
19:01
big and it's just important that they
19:04
they see him they see him physically or
19:06
they hear us out of a voice it's very
19:07
important for a big thing
19:10
that will come up ahead for their faith
19:13
to be strong but
19:15
it's not an indicator like if you've
19:18
seen Jesus physically or heard his
19:21
Audible Voice it doesn't make that
19:22
person
19:23
like a
19:24
a better Christian or anything it's
19:27
nothing like that and it doesn't make on
19:29
the other hand it doesn't make the
19:31
people who haven't seen or heard God
19:35
have stronger Faith because God didn't
19:38
have to appear them in that way it
19:40
doesn't mean either of those things but
19:42
I will say if if you have not
19:45
audibly heard God or
19:48
seeing him physically
Are You Blessed
19:50
take it as him saying blessed are you
19:55
blessed are you you are blessed you have
19:59
you have believed without seeing without
20:01
hearing audibly and
20:04
sometimes it does mean that God can
20:07
entrust you with this
20:09
like he knows that
20:11
if he doesn't appear to you physically
20:13
or talk to you audibly
20:14
you'll still believe you'll still stay
20:18
in there even in The Valleys when you
20:22
so badly want to hears out of a voice
20:24
and and see him physically but you hang
20:27
in there and you stand strong in faith
20:31
in your relationship with him and you
20:33
remain content with how he wants to
20:36
speak to you and with how he wants to
20:39
appear to you what you have to really
20:42
make sure is that you're not
20:45
um gauging your closeness to God based
20:48
on a physical feeling
Faith Not Feelings
20:51
it's not physical it's faith
20:54
the hearing from God the seeing him and
20:57
things the sensing his presence this is
21:00
all based on faith not feelings
21:04
there will be times when what happens in
21:07
the spirit
21:08
it transcends it goes to the soul into
21:12
the body where you actually feel him
21:16
physically God wants you to have those
21:19
moments
21:20
to build your faith and to meet him to
21:24
really meet Jesus have these experience
21:27
encounters and for me like that was the
21:31
baps of the Holy Spirit I also and
21:34
prophetic words he gave me and I
21:35
remember I received an invitation from
21:37
him and I fell back with God's power so
21:40
for me I've had these
21:42
experiences where I it went to the
21:45
Physical Realm even where you could
21:46
really you could feel God
21:48
and those are so special to me and dear
21:51
to me but they aren't every single day
21:53
and that's okay they're not supposed to
21:55
be every single day because remember
21:56
it's based on faith not feelings where
21:58
Christians can
22:00
go wrong is think that when you're
22:03
feeling something
22:05
then
22:07
God's presence is with you when you're
22:10
not feeling anything then God's presence
22:12
isn't there some people will be so
22:14
desperate for that feeling that they'll
22:16
they'll conjure up
22:18
they'll conjure up uh
22:20
a feeling or get maybe even sew in their
22:23
head because they want it so badly it's
Surrender Your Relationship
22:25
important we don't manipulate God or
22:27
that we are just looking to the feeling
22:30
rather than the person of Jesus
22:34
we need to respect Jesus and how he
22:36
wants to speak to us how he wants to
22:40
um how he wants to have a relationship
22:43
with us we have to let God lead he's the
22:46
leader of our relationship
22:48
not us and so it's important you don't
22:51
try to run the relationship and you
22:53
don't try to you know you just want to
22:54
hear God a certain way you just want to
22:56
see him a certain way maybe you
22:58
encountered him a certain way and you
23:00
just want to keep going there and and
23:03
having that same exact encounter again
23:04
and again when God wants us do a
23:07
different thing wants to speak to you in
23:08
a different way
23:09
so surrender your relationship with God
23:13
let go and allow God to lead in what
23:17
this relationship looks like and how his
23:19
voice comes and his presence how you
23:21
experience that what that looks like the
23:24
