Intro
you poured the anointing oil on my head I release this anointing upon you
now receive it now receive increase it
was probably the most special moment of my whole life I will say it is the most
special moment of my whole life Welcome to the Revival is Now podcast I'm
Apostle Katherine Crick and I'm so excited to have my guest pastor hea
here today welcome thank you for having me I'm so blessed to be here I'm excited
for what God's going to do on this podcast today I know God's going to speak he's going to move in power and
I'm so excited amen you have been such a blessing to my life such a blessing at
fivefold church and I would love for you to share what brought you to 5f
What brought you to 5F
church it was truly a desperation to see the Miracles of God and to experience
God's power in my Ministry my husband and I had pastored a church 10 years
prior to coming to 5f for the first time it was during covid times and so many
churches were closed mandated to be closed and we wanted to see more I
belied what would Jesus be doing during this time wouldn't he be Healing The Sick wouldn't he be ministering the
gospel would he shut the doors and so we had kept our small Church
open and I was introduced to your ministry online someone had tagged me in a post
and I looked at it I had a lot of time at home during that time obviously and I
saw what God was doing in your ministry
I watched you intensely I watched people get delivered
from demonic strongholds and truly delivered I watched people getting
healed I saw a young beautiful spirit filled woman in the park in Pan Pacific
Park in Los Angeles ministering boldly like a
lioness and I I saw God's power moving these were the Miracles I had always
longed for in my Ministry in my life to help people and so I watched I watched I
watched and as soon as Sunday came I told my husband after Sunday service I'm
driving down it starts at 300 p.m. it was May of 2021 I'm going down to 5f
church which I had just found out meant fivefold church and when I came for the first
time I was in awe I my tears just flowed joyful tears I I realized this this is
what Jesus would be doing right now if Jesus was here on the earth and and I
sat through the service I watched you Minister I watched you minister with such love and grace with truth with
peace with boldness and then I watched you take authority over demonic spirits in people
with no humiliation no condemnation towards them at all I watch God Minister
through you to so many people who were so hungry they had nowhere to go no even
Church would offer this that I knew of even before Co and now when the churches
were closed they could come to the park and I saw them get changed I saw the
transformation I watched testimonies and I I couldn't wait till the next Sunday I
couldn't wait to come back so we would have our service we would close our service and I would get in the car and
drive an hour and a half to La so excited just to see what God would do so
that's how I came to to find you it was really God it was
desperation and then I didn't know the impartation of the anointing I didn't
understand that because I had taught in Bible College I'd gone to Bible College
I'd been part of a very large Ministry prior to that it was 177,000 people it
was a mega church and then we had started our own church I had studied
past revivals past moves of God always looking for keys of how I could operate
like that and help people help people who would want the
same anointing because I did believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and
today but I wasn't seeing that same Jesus operating in my life so I would
read and study about these past moves of God but then I would be sad because I
would say well that came and went what about now is there any such a thing as
could I operate in this and people could actually experience this power that
happened in Jesus's Ministry and in the acts church and then I saw you release an
impartation to a man who came I believe with his child his daughter I believe he
was an evangelist on the east coast and I believe he drove out with her and You released the impartation of
the anointing to him and I was shocked because all these
other moves of God that I had studied they didn't pass it to other people but
I know it was biblical because I know the Apostle Paul imparted that gift to
Timothy but when I saw that you were freely releasing this
impartation I realized she's not stingy God's actually offering
this and I didn't feel like you would push me out if I asked so my third week
down I brought two people with me one was severely demon oppressed and I
wanted Deliverance for her and I brought her up to you and she did receive
freedom and then I I felt like I had to push through the crowd like the woman
with the issue of blood but I stood there shaking and saying I am a pastor
and I want this impartation as well I'm ready for the anointing this
The anointing
people has to be set free my husband and I pastor of church and I've been saved 41 years and I've never seen a Ministry
like this and I'm ready for the anointing cuz I'm ready to see people
set free if that they're not going to get set free need
living what I wanted I said Lord I haven't seen many pastors here and I
don't know where they are I don't know where you are but you know what it's coming in a fivefold Ministry is here
and I I don't look at you as as as less than me I thank God for the anointing on your life and I I want it on my life
because I got to see people set
free you touch God's heart your heart is special it is rare and it is usable by
God and I declare that Revival would spread through you and that eyes would open up and that Spirit of religion
would be destroyed through you in jesus' name I see you speaking like fire like
out of your mouth like fire very sharp fire
destroying the dead the dead religions just and waking people up like
a blazing fire yes your heart is so perfect to be
used by God God says thank you Jesus thank you
Lord I release this anointing to you now I declare it signs wonders and miracles
to happen through you thank you Jesus thank you Lord
hallelujah praise God praise God and you invited me to receive it and you asked
Receiving the anointing
me why do you want this impartation of the anointing and to me it was so easy
to just say to help the people in my church because they need it what gospel
am I preaching if I don't have any demonstration I can teach the Bible I can read Greek I can read Hebrew but I
want them to see the miracles of Jesus in their life and You released the
anointing to me you spoke some beautiful short but powerful prophetic words over
me that my words would be like fire and that God would use me to Break Down The
Walls of religion that had been built in people's lives and then you released the
impartation to me and I fell back under the power of God and my life was changed from that
moment forward but I really wasn't quite ready or knowing that it would happen so
quickly yes hallelujah hallelujah I remember that
vividly I remember that day like it was yesterday really yes yes I remember you
coming forward and how powerfully God released his anointing to you and I just
remember feeling so much joy to hear your testimony and shock uh just I don't know a few weeks
later or something I don't know whenever you shared the testimony of what happened since that day
because I I had never until that point heard of God using Pastors in their
churches with this anointing that I imparted to them I had not seen that I
had not heard of that until you and even even for me casting out demons was so
new I was called by God to be an apostle and received impartation of anointing
for my spiritual father Prophet Dr Jord Davy um I received that pretty much
pretty much almost immediately after receiving that calling of being an apostle but God gives measures many time
always and so for me it was a small measure and then he tested me and took me through Wilderness until he poured
out a greater measure and really it was a combination of God's timing for my life to receive even more anointing that
makes demons tremble and go and the sick be healed and God's timing of when he
wanted this revival to break out this Deliverance Revival to break out because I was ministering I was pastoring the
church fful church for about three and a three years
um yeah I think it was like three and a half years I was pastoring the church before many big Miracles were happening
before demons were trumed in and leaving people and sick being healed um and we would I would see God move in power but
not like demon shrieking and not like this demons going and not like this and
so once God was ready to move in that way March 2021 the first demon manifes
and was cast out of a woman and then the floodgates just opened up the floodgates of the anointing to make demons
go uh and I mean I mean it many people were coming every week hungry for
deliverance and God kept delivering them and then two months after that first demon was cast out 300 showed up from
20s something the day the first demon was cast out to 300 just two months later which is at this moment that we're
H we're sitting down talking is actually the anniversary is coming up in about a week or so is that anniversary of 300
coming and you said it was May that you came as well you know oh wow prophetic
for us to be remembering what God has done to but um so when you had come and
I released the impartation it had only been two months that that I had seen God use me in power to cast out demons so I
remember when you came back and told me demon started manifesting and leaving
people in the church I was just in awe I was like wow God it's really Revival
like you are ready to move and deliver your people and not everybody has to
wait so long as I did from the first moment of the prophecy or you know Hallelujah yes exactly God's people must
be free it's time so can you share what that looked like what that that
What the anointing looked like
impartation looked like yes absolutely I I had been watching you for about
three weeks and I had been coming down before I'd received the impartation and we had a women's Bible
study um gathering on Friday nights during that time and during the
Gathering one woman who now comes to 5f every single Sunday her husband she
The story of Marlo
and her husband come yes um her name was Marlo she was manifesting a demon at our
Women's Bible study and something she needed prayer for something and she
couldn't she couldn't speak and I because I had been watching you I had
realized this is a demon and so in our little group here I hadn't received the
impartation I began to say come out I want you to come out and she was down on
the ground it wouldn't come out this went on for over an hour and a half and
I had no real Authority or power and I was feeling horrible for her because she
was in trauma trying to get this thing out I get it out I was repeating over and over and I'm thinking this is not
how Apostle Catherine does it this not it's not as laborious and exhausting
this poor woman I just then I just began to just sing a praise song over her and
it subdued and she could go home but I knew she didn't really get free yeah and
then my heart broke and I said I can't operate on this this this is this is not
going to work no one will truly get free they'll just be in pain and I can take them to 5f church of
course and I will I've always been offering people rides there I even got a bigger car to bring them now so that was
Friday night the Sunday You released the impartation to me wow and I drove home
Why Marlo had such desperation
that Sunday and that's why you had such hunk desperation I didn't realize this till now wow cuz I remember you I
remember you just having this desperation like very you were very serious you're like
I need this anointing because the PE people must be free the God's people must be free something like that you
said and you were so serious and and now it makes such sense wow and that's God
preparing you to receive that go because he's given me a heart
for the Sheep he's given me a heart for his people God gave that to me I wasn't born with that but the Holy Spirit gave
that to me but I was inept honestly my heart was wanting but I didn't have the
power so then when you released the impartation to me and I drove home I was excited on the inside but I
The release of the anointing
didn't know when it would manifest I just believed I just well she released
the anointing to me it's done it's it's done and so Wednesday night after that
Sunday three days later I was teaching on a Wednesday night at church and it
was small gathering maybe 12 my husband wasn't there he was at home he wasn't
feeling well so I was beginning to teach what you were teaching I began to teach
about the fivefold I was taking what I had learned from you and I was beginning to teach this as I was very very
new and I said does anybody want prayer for anything at the end of the teaching
What do you need prayer for
and a woman I had known for over eight years was crying and she'd come to the
front and her my other friend in church said she needs prayer and I says what do
you need prayer for and she says because I have such depression all the time in
confusion and I said well would you like to renounce that and she renounced and I
said in jesus' name I detach you from that and I command those spirits to
leave you now in Jesus name she went down on the ground and EV
that had never happened in our church in a decade Hallelujah it had never
She went down
happened in any Ministry I'd ever been at 40 years and she went down on the ground
and then I realized this is what's happening Lord and so I commanded to leave she began to cough up we had no
buckets we had a couple of tissue boxes and people were handing tissue to her and nobody knew what to do but I was
listening to the Holy Spirit he says this is what's happening now and I commanded it to leave and while she was
down on the ground she looked up at me and she says it's gone so she stood back
up and she began to walk a few steps away and she says there's one more thing
she says I have to tell you this I have always had Suicidal
Thoughts she'd never told me that in all the years I knew her probably didn't
I own her
realize I could do anything about it except comfort her and hug her and tell her well God has a plan for you life
right and I said well that is a demonic Spirit would you like to renounce that
as she began to renounce a demon spoke out of her and said I own her and then the
other 12 people in the church got kind of rattled and I looked and I realized
this was a different voice it wasn't my friend's voice and now I'm face to face with a
demon and I have my husband's not in the church Church my co-pastor husband's not
in the church to look to no one in the church knew what to do and I said Lord
can I do this this was just very quickly in the spirit he said you received the
impartation three days ago you can do this we'll do this
together and then immediately I just thought of how easily it was for you to do that and if you had for seen that it
was I was capable of carrying the impartation of the anointing that I could then do it in this domain of our
church and I then this righteous indignation rose up I said you don't own
anybody you be quiet and come out of her now and she fell on the ground she began
to roll around us a little bit I said out now in Jesus name just like I had
been taught by watching you and going down to FV and she looked at me and she
She began to weep
said it's gone on and she began to weep she began to sob and I just said I just
release the anointing of joy and peace to you now in jesus' name no more Suicidal Thoughts no more confusion and
no more depression and she testified the next day that for the first time in her
life she did not hear voices in her head at night when she went to bed she slept peacefully all night long and I couldn't
wait to share this somehow with you that it would encourage you to know that it
really worked the anointing really worked I cherished it I honored it and I
She was free
received it by faith and now it was happening hallelujah hallelujah right
Hallelujah she was free she was so excited I was so excited I went home and
I told my husband we didn't have any of it on camera at the time and I was so excited I just laid in bed and cried I
said Lord you really set her free tonight my friend doesn't have to to live with all this this torment anymore
this is really real but then I realized I need I have a lot to learn and so that's that was three years ago and
almost every single Sunday with maybe the maybe three Sundays I I've been out
of out of state or out of town I've gone to 5f and I listen to you and I learn
and I'm a disciple and I'm a ready listener because I had so much old wine in me that I didn't realize
was there and I couldn't walk in just casting out demons I need to be able to bring this revival as well at however
capacity God is going to use me and I'm so excited to be used by God yes
amen and your church that you Pastor is about an a little more than an hour from
The fruits of impartation
La without traffic right yeah so you every Sunday for three years pretty much
you you minister at your church and then you drive down and now bring a van of
people from your church yes to come and receive at fivefold church so powerful
so powerful and do you want to share like how impartation just continued I
mean the fruits of impartation like you explained that one time of Deliverance at your church so what happened the next
time you ministered and the next time and there from 3 years till now well
it's never stopped it happened that one on Wednesday night and then it continued
it continued happening on the Friday women's Gathering it happened on Sunday mornings it happened every single
service and if you were to add it up there would probably be hundreds and
hundreds of demons being cast out hundreds and hundreds of people getting
set free um at least I mean the church still as far as numbers isn't large yet
but every service there's multiple people getting delivered layer after
layer there's been so many healings one woman came in with a doctor's note that
she had just gotten from the doctor and there was a tumor in her body that was the size probably of a tennis ball she
had come in in pain she had been in the emergency room and she renounced as she
came up she says I renounce this tumor and as I began to speak over her demons screamed out and I commanded every
Spirit of infirmity all generational curses everything that I was learning from you I was implementing not rushing
ahead but just implementing and she screamed out she fell down on the ground
she went to the back in the restroom and came back out and it was gone she was
pushing on her lower abdomen and it was gone she was dancing around the church
it happens every single service there's been hundreds and hundreds so we don't have a service without demons coming out
of people without the power of God coming on people without them being baptized in the fire of the Holy Spirit
marriages are healed lives are healed parents and children are reunited
there's just there's just tremendous Revival happening hallelujah
amen hallelujah and have you seen it increase the anointing the level it's
The anointing is spread
been three years now it's been three years and the more I Surrender the more I listen the more I
learn it does increase the anointing is spread to my husband several months
after I received the impartation he heard from the Lord to come down and receive impartation too
and he began to watch you with me and he came down and received the impartation
there we were at the park by jeene Atri Museum Griffith Park and when you
released the anointing to him he said he literally felt like a lightning bolt
just hit his head and he was he said he felt the power of God now I didn't have
a sensation of a lightning bolt but I just knew I couldn't stand I just fell back under the power but he literally
felt like an electric current go into him and after that he began operating in
Deliverance he began operating in the in his gift and his calling and ministering
in a whole new level and the anointing has never ceased with him either so both of us now the
anointing has made me aware of what it is to be a
The anointing has made me aware
pastor to be a leader to understand Authority like I've read the Bible
several times and I know the word anointing but until I sat under your
teaching couldn't Define it I I would have said it's the power of
God but I wouldn't have known well who carries it how does it get transfered how does it get past I didn't understand
the word Apostle now I understand it's so much easier now for me to receive
because I understand that the vessel is poured into you as the vessel poured into me and then I carry
that anointing that you received and now it's growing it's expanding on the
inside and I I I'm as the old wine goes out the new wine comes in I'm expanding
like that new wine bag and and I'm becoming more accurate in words of
knowledge when people come up as I've seen you operate in in prophetic like
you hear something for someone and then you you expose it or you bring it to the
light and then that Spirit comes comes out of them or they get healed or they
renounce that certain area that maybe was hidden to them before but it took a word of knowledge I'm learning how to
use the keys that you talked about in the anointing and to operate and flow in
that more and more there's much more joy and peace in me the old wine of
rejection people pleasing insecurity is gone praise God and
there's so much joy so much peace and maturity and now I'm learning how to be
equipped in this beautiful position of being a pastor but also being a a a a
mentee and a disciple and it's such a beautiful place of safety it truly is where I can
flourish it's what I've always wanted and I'm just so grateful to be receiving
this anointing and to stay in the place that God's called me and to just grow
not be impatient just grow in peace and Revelation so I can truly become
equipped for the work of the ministry amen hallelujah Hallelujah
Its Gods will
Jesus so it is really God's will it is God's will for you to walk in the
anointing those of you who are listening and watching it is God's will for you to be a vest of his power it's not supposed
to be for just one or five or 10 people it's not supposed to be just for
ministers for people who have big platforms pastors ministers who have big
platforms the Bible says all who believe these signs shall follow them they will cast out demons they will lay hands on
the sick and they will recover these are some of the signs all who believe not just those who were called to be fful
ministers those who have huge platforms forms all who believe this is truly
God's calling for your life to be a vessel of him in his fullness that when somebody needs freedom and God's calling
you to pray for them in your spiritual territory Dominion that God could use
you for this 911 emergency situation where a demon has put its hands it its
grip on this person's life God wants to use you he wants you to be ready a ready vessel but so many people people are not
operating in the anointing today so many people are not having the experience
that you have had so many pastors now all who believe they should walk in the anointing but even more so pastors
ministers should walk in the anointing it's a disgrace to not be able to free
people who are oppressed and coming to the church coming to receive from Jesus and you can only release a part of Jesus
to them word word but not the power where you can't really help them it's
it's awful I mean it's not representing Jesus rightly it's not giving the people
what God wants them to have ex and people are just staying stuck and so
ministers must be carrying the anointing this is this is a must I mean this is how it should be every Church there's
preaching there's Healing The Sick there's casting out of demons there's raising of the dead at times there's the
prophetic word going forth this is how the church should be the church not just some Churches every church every
Ministry amen so you are a pastor and you are operating in the anointing there
are many pastors many many for the majority probably are not operating in the anointing so what is your advice to
Advice to other pastors
them I mean do you think you're just just one of the very few chosen
ones or do you think that other pastors out there could have what you have and
if so what do they need to do what have you done well humble yourself and realize if
you're a fireman but you don't have any water you're not a fireman you you might have a uniform on you might have a big
red truck you might have a siren but if you don't have any water you cannot put anybody's fire out if you have no
anointing it's like a Christian in name only it's a minister in name only it's
having a form of godliness but no power now we've quoted that scripture so many
times but are we really looking at it and realizing I have no power to cast demons
out of people so what am I doing what Jesus am I preaching like really become
transparent and not condemned but be convinced and convicted and realize I am
not doing the will of God and if I want to do the will of God
I must humble myself I must receive the new wine I must receive the vessel that
the Lord has chosen to put the new wine in and I can then be used by God if not
I need to hang up my clerical robe or my Bible College certificate or my Seminary
degree and realize I am not helping people like Jesus did and the apostles
did in the book of Acts and this to me is such a parallel of
what Jesus brought to the Jews and to the the the the people of under the law
during the gospels he was bringing to them the kingdom he was conferring upon
them the kingdom and it was going to be done God's way and it was going to be separate from what they thought even
though they were so religious and they went to church all the time they met all the time they knew the scriptures inside
and out in fact they were so happy that they knew the scriptures and that many others
didn't but Jesus says you search the scriptures for in them you think you
Church leaders must come humbly
find eternal life yet you don't even recognize who's speaking to you right
now and so the church leaders who truly have a heart for God's
people must come humbly they must surrender themselves they must look in
the Bibles that they've had in their hands for how many years and how many decades and and look beyond the surface
of the um hermeneutical Greek in Hebrew just look
and say am I doing what Jesus did am I doing what the apostles did am I doing
am I understanding Ephesians 4:11 that God says Jesus gave gifts some
to be Apostles prophets and evangelists and pastors and teachers for the
equipping of the Saints and these shall continue that means they didn't come to
an end no matter what your Bible College taught you no no matter what somebody who's not even alive on the earth taught
you hundreds of years ago it must continue until we all come into the
perfect Unity of that one man which when you say this is the end time Revival
that it's not a conference on a weekend it's it's not just a an apostle Katherine Ministry it's a global
revelation of what Jesus wants to do before he comes back before Jesus comes
back the church has to come back into the full manifestation of what we were supposed
to carry so whether the apostle that comes to you comes in the
vessel or the form of a woman in her 30s
preaching in a park preaching from a battery operated microphone playing a
battery operated keyboard with people walking in front of the camera and dogs
and pets and everything around Jesus comes in the most obscure
Look at the fruit
ways but if you can see him would you acknowledge would you acknowledge this
is his what he's doing look at the fruit when you see the fruit then you know
what the tree is and so I see the fruit I would tell every Minister every
Pastor every Apostle Prophet every teacher come to where the anointing is
let your eyes be open come as a humble child come with a heart ready to repent
and to change and he'll accept this amazing call to truly be a minister that
carries the anointing that can minister to people and see them set free in these
days because there were those that were 120 in the upper room and they said we
will wait until the power comes and then the apostles every single apostle was in
that upper room and when they came out and Peter preached and 3,000 people were
saved w wow and then it began signs wonders and miracles extraordinary
Miracles through the hands of apostle Paul it was exploding everywhere and everybody who came and listened to the
apostles teaching grew they become strong people sold property lands just
to to to bring the the the finances so the apostles could this could go out
into every city in every nation and it's got to come now this is that which God
is saved for the very last days it's that it's real it's real and my life and
my Ministry is a living testimony my marriage my family our business
everything everything and it's only like you said 1% wait till the 99 comes into play yes
we've only seen about 1% of what now that was before uh Pentecost 2.0 it
flourished so now it's expanded Beyond 1% but that was a a glimpse into the
rest of the 99 that we are going to see that God's going to blow our minds with in this end
time Revival you have such a beautiful heart Pastor Heather you have a Precious Heart
Your heart is beautiful
you were truly a chosen one and I truly see why God chose you why God poured out
his anointing in you because your heart is beautiful it is humble it is pure and
it's a a servant heart and I I just long
for people to see your heart and see the fruits in your life and see the impartation the fruits in your ministry
and learn from it because I know that what God has done in your life he wants to multiply he wants to do in so many
pastors so many ministers you are so you are much older than me you've been a
Christian decades longer than I have been you've taught in Bible school I
didn't even go to Bible School but so that like shows the level of
humility you have God uses the weak and foolish things so it doesn't make sense
in the natural it doesn't make sense it's confounding of our human wisdom why God would work in this way why God would
choose to release the impartation to you in this way and uh uh this mentorship in
this way growing and being equipped in this way but his ways are not our ways but they're perfect and we don't get to
choose it's God's Choice who he uses in his ways you
know it seems like it's so hard for people to be humble and it breaks my heart because it's like I see
that the path of humility is the path to everything that one could desire and
more we desire an abundant life we desire blessings for the glory of God in
our lives we desire the favor of God Upon Our Lives we desire to be used mightily by God and I see many
Christians they have these desires but they don't want to go the humble route like it's not that their desires
are bad there could be some selfish motivation sometimes but like at the end of the day like I want God to use me
like that's a good desire you know but a lot of people they they don't they have
this resistance to go the humble way and it breaks my heart because I know they're just stuck I know that God they
can't force God's hand and they're not going to get these things that they want and God wants for them without the
selfishness you know for God's glory he wants that Abundant Life he wants them
to be used powerfully by him so what do you have to say to those
Lay it all down for Jesus
people that maybe are looking at you saying I want what she has but I don't know if I can
do that it maybe they feel like oh that makes me uncomfortable to receive from
that vessel you know or oh what people think oh like the fear of man thoughts
are like really plaguing them and that like maybe they're watching this or listening right now and they feel that
struggle that internal struggle what do you have to say to them lay it all down for
Jesus lay it all down for Jesus the way that he came as a baby in
a Manger laid in a feeding trough doesn't that clue you in on something
that he wasn't born in a palace that that that there wasn't um all the the
religious leaders that were were there there were shepherds that God chose to
alert taking care of their sheep by night and saying come you will find the
baby you'll find him wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a Manger he's born of a
virgin it's never the way that we want it in the natural because God's so far
outside of the natural that that's why the devil can never figure him out
mankind can never figure him out when it's Jesus first it's any way you want
it it's any way you choose it's you are Lord Jesus is
Lord Jesus is Lord he does it his way his timing and if you recog ognize him
you will you will recognize him in things that appear insignificant or hidden or obscure or you realize he he's
he's not standing on a podium in some big platform like Nebuchadnezzar did in
the Book of Daniel everybody bow down to my idol no Jesus
comes as a servant he comes hidden he comes in a
way we can't see him and when he comes we should recognize him with our heart
and you just taught this on Sunday at 5f about if you have jealousy or pride in
your heart and you said they both go together if you have one or both of those in your heart go to God with it he
remove those things from your heart so say Lord if there's to a many any ministers are saying this I don't know
about this I'd have to get rid of all my books I'd have to get rid of all my CDs and all my things that I've preached you
know well okay get rid of it then wouldn't you rather to have it get done now and then work for the kingdom
instead of it be wood hay and stubble in the fire when the Lord says no it has to
go through the fire it's going to be burned if I brought before you a king in
Royal robes or this man who's got this Min a man right who's got this large Ministry and there's you know 500,000
followers you B bow down to him but what if I bring you a woman in a park who's
you know 30 I saw you were 31 years old then what why wouldn't you follow what I'm
showing you because my spirit is hidden in a vessel of clay it's what's in the
vessel humble yourself Lay It lay it down before the
Lord and then say Lord I want the new wine I'll do it your way I didn't call
myself I called by you I just want an audience of one your approval I will lay
it all down and and the Apostle Paul even said I count all my previous religious experience who was a Pharisee
of Pharisees as dung compared to carrying The Treasure
of the Gospel the minute you see the first person truly set free because you
carry the anointing you can't go back you'll realize I'm actually helping now
I'm a fireman with water I'm a minister with power and I'm doing the will of my
father who sent me then you know you found your purpose and then you're
excited and you're ready to go forward you're ready to receive and I wanted to
speak to you very quickly about when you poured the anointing oil on my head at
flourish flourish confence yes God is is so proud of you you are a
Release the anointing
faithful servant he can trust you he's so proud of you so many people have come and
received this anointing because of your obedience he is so proud of you and it's
time for more it's time for increase it's time for the next
level I release this anointing upon you now receive it now receive increase may
God use you in greater power may God use you in Greater signs and wonders and
miracles May many more people be delivered and healed in jesus'
[Applause] name it
was probably the most special moment of my whole life I will say it is the most
special moment of my whole life
I know that God showed you it was time for more I don't know what the more looks
like but I receive whatever God says I can carry I look at myself and I say
Lord I I'm just yours whatever you want to do in me use me for your glory for
your kingdom but after that oil was poured on
my head head I felt as if there was going to be new
responsibilities um new wisdom new levels new depths with Jesus new signs
and wonders and that I would be even more useful for him but there would also
be a growth in me a deeper growth of the roots and the understanding and the Lord
has shown me by sitting under your Ministry and by having you as my spiritual
mother that I don't have to understand I will
walk by faith and believe what's coming through this pure and beautiful
vessel and as I receive it then he gives me understanding and as he gives me
understanding I realize it's more than I even dreamed so I always know that
obedience precedes understanding but there's I just have walked through the
last couple weeks of a very hot fiery trial um with the health issues that my
husband has gone through and then having to handle bus our business and our church and all the other things that
came but because that anointing was given to me on Saturday morning at the flourish
conference God had reminded me just like he did when that first demon was truly cast out I have equipped you it was
imparted to you you can go through this strong you're not weak you're not flimsy
you're not going to fail Apostle Katherine released it to you and I told her to do that and I'm in charge of her
I'm in charge of who she releases this anointing too and she doesn't do it
without my leadership so now Heather you've gone up in a level of strength but you've gone deeper in your roots so
I just want to thank you Apostle Katherine for ministering so lovingly and beautiful to my life to
speak about my heart like no one in my life has ever spoken about my
heart we were taught many things in Bible college but nothing about speaking into someone's heart but the Lord spoke
through you when you spoke to my heart and you continue to speak to my heart
constantly and that's always how the Holy Spirit truly speaks to me
not intellect so much always heart and I honor you for being who you're called to
be and for carrying this huge anointing and this huge mantle that you would
invite other pastors and ministers even possibly people who spoke against you to
come and to receive and that you would pour it out to anyone who would come
because you're vessel of God you're vessel of honor and you are definitely a vessel of Honor in the house of the Lord
and I'm just so grateful that God would let me to be part of of of this ministry
of 5f church and to receive glory to God I am so proud of
The right way
you and it's my prayer that there would be so many people that would hear this
that would see this podcast episode because I truly believe hearts are being
convicted everywhere right now I truly believe that they are seeing the right
way as there's a there's a scripture where Paul says I will show you the right way he says this to his disciples
and so God sends leaders he sends ministers anointed ministers to show the right
way and you have shown the right way you have shown the right way for pastors for
ministers for church leaders at this hour that we are in in this end time
Revival I am so proud of you and I am truly so excited for what God is going
You have a usable heart
to do in your in the future you haven't seen anything yet because you have a
usable heart you're a usable vessel because of your precious heart your pure rare heart humble heart he will use you
so so powerfully it is just the beginning the joy that will come from
just seeing God use you the lives changed is like no joy you've ever known
like it's just so small what you've seen I see compared to what God has in store
just like it's been about 1% that we've seen in this end time Revival of what
God has planned the same for your life with how God will use you in Revival in your life

to every listener everyone watching right now I see God pouring out his
spirit and removing impurities of the heart right now the devil does not want
you to receive this anointing this precious anointing of Jesus this revival
the devil does not want you to be a part of this end time Revival but I declare that he has lost
today I declare now that every scheme of the devil that's tried to pull you from
God's will that's tried to hold you back with Spirit of religion with pride with
lies of people with this casual opposite
of fear of God mentality I declare all of that would leave your life now in Jesus
name and I speak your eyes to open up more more Rev to come of what obedience
to God looks like of what fearing God looks like of what humility looks like of what surrender looks
like I release this anointing upon you now and I release an impartation of
purity of humility upon you of of purity of heart David was a man after God's
heart may you be a man or a woman after God's heart may you know what that looks
like may you see what that looks like may you see God's heart know God's heart
from now not religion's heart not what other people want you to do but God's
heart may you see that from now like never before in Jesus name and those of
you that are ready those of you pastors out there ministers out there and any True Believer who is surrendered to God
that wants to be used in God used by God in power that is humble that is
surrendered I release this anointing to you now may the same power of God moving
through me that was imparted to Pastor Heather May the same anointing come upon you now and fill you to
overflow from this moment may you be used in God used by God in power to cast
out demons to heal the sick to speak prophetically to do whatever God wants you to do to touch another's life in
