hallelujah you me wonder you
me and the Bible says that when you knock on the
door it'll be opened when you seek you'll find yeah ask and it will be given to
you and there's so many people who are in bondage out there yeah and God
doesn't want them to be in bondage God wants to free them and it's easy for him to free them but he has
principles he doesn't force himself you got to want it yes you need to ask seek
and knock so we have to ask seek and knock to receive Jesus and all that he
has for us and so I remember that day you came with you came asking and
seeking and knocking with everything that is within you and it was so
beautiful and looking back just like even seeing you now and seeing like
knowing even more that desperation it was one of the most beautiful sides I've ever seen because you were undignified
unashamed just you didn't care who who saw you full of
desperation you didn't care it was filmed yeah your eyes were just on Jesus
and it was beautiful and it's an example for many and I know many people have gained courage to renounce to come
publicly in the presence of the anointing and receive Deliverance because of your testimony that's gone
viral and because of your this Deliverance that God did in your life that's gone viral I don't know how many
views I think there's like more than a million views somewhere I have I haven't checked it lately but there's I think Beyond a million I don't know if you
know last time Austin was sharing with me that it had a million on Tik Tok and I was just on Tik Tok alone and then it
had so many more on Instagram and Facebook and it was so beautiful how God
delivered you but let's let's go let's rewind a little bit let's go back before
you came to fivefold church were you raised Christian I was raised Catholic
actually and um I just never really I just thought of God as like a big scary
guy that like is writing down all my sins and like I wasn't the most well
behaved so I was like oh yeah I probably am you know not really good in his book
and then um when I was 18 is when I became a Christian and I found God on my
own yeah and and how old are you you now I'm 26 awesome yeah so you really became
a Believer born again uh and began to give your life to Jesus at at 18 yeah at
18 and so tell me about your life you know from
that time up until one year ago about when you came to FF church so desperate
for deliverance what was going on then yeah so when I was 18 I found God by um
I was i' growing up I always was very um
a sad kid but I also was like really extroverted and popular in school so
people expected me to like show up so I always kind of thought of it as like my mask so I when I would go out be super
happy be ramp punctious like you know life of the party and then when I go home I would be so sad and um you know I
I was depressed and very suicidal like from an early age um a lot of attempts
you know but it's just like I'm Nigerian so you know you just kind of keep it quiet and you move forward and you get
through all the like you know situations so there's no shame um and I you know by
the time that I was in high school you know my family wanted me to like confirm like C like and I was just like no I'm
not doing that like I know that I don't I don't want to even get married in the Catholic church so um yeah I I was ready
for college at that point because I had such a tumultuous relationship with my parents like my dad was pretty good but
my mom like growing up like it just was like never saw eye to eye and and at by
the time that I graduated and went to college for the first time I was like my I would always say like my mom is my
biggest op like op is like a thing the kids say for like opposition you know um
and so I was like I'm ready to go to college but then I got to college and I thought you know that was what was
keeping me from from killing myself because I was like oh like one day I'll have freedom I'll be out of this house
and then I got to college and I'm like I'm still depressed I'm still sad I'm still hearing all these voices to end my
life and I was like well Lord if this is it like I'm ready to go like there's nothing else and then um I was in my
dorm room one day and I um I had talked to a girl before and she shared with me
like she's sh about shared about Christ and said like he's not this big scary guy and he has a plan and purpose for
your life and I was was like ah I think I I I feel like I I'm metant for something so I went to my dorm room I
prayed and I like closed my eyes and I felt like a bright light around me like bright bright light but my eyes were
closed and I felt warmth and I was just like oh this is scary so I like stopped praying and I ran to this girl that a
different girl that she was Christian and I was like does this happen she's like no that's scary go handle that and
I was like I was like okay so I went back and I was like I just am going to surrender to this and that's when I
heard God it was like a like a radio and I can finally hear God and he was just telling me how much he loved me and how
he's been here for me through this moment and this moment and I was how did you hear that was it like a still Small
Voice like this knowing it was like a still Small Voice and in my voice like but I but I I always said mean things to
myself so this was like it sounded like your thoughts but you knew it wasn't your thoughts I knew it wasn't my thoughts cuz I was ready to go and then
I all of a sudden I hear like I love you my daughter like I have have a plan for your life like I love you so much I'm so
glad that you want to talk to me and from that day forward I was like I will serve you for the rest of my life you
saved my life and that's when like I fell in love with Jesus and you know uh
after that um the girl that actually shared with me about Jesus I ended up
getting into a relationship with her and it you know turned into a domestic violence and it was a lot of religious
abuse like so I didn't know you know I'm like a new baby like a friendship or no I ended up getting into like a romantic
relationship with her and yeah and then it turned into like domestic violence and like you know I I stopped speaking
to my family like I left school um just she isolated me and like I could only
read the Bible with her it was just a it was a really one of the craziest times
of my life and and you know I found out more about her and you know she had you
know was very dangerous and very like aggressive and um I one day like looked
in the miror and I was like God I'm in a really bad situation and can you please like save me and that's when I would
like try to sneak and read the Bible myself and I was reading about like Moses and the Israelites and I was like
and I was like God you provided an exodus for them provide an exodus for me so God provided a really awesome way I
never had to go I never had to see her again and I've never seen her since um
and that was great but then I entered into to the real world I I rekindled with my family it was the first time
that like my mom and I were on good terms I was already seeing like the fruits of following Jesus um and I went
back to school and I just was you know trying to heal because that was such a traumatic situation but I you know
because I didn't have anybody to really lead me I was like more so kind of obsessed with like the culture of being
a Christian so I wanted to like not do all the things of smoking and you know
and drinking and you know like having prematal sex like I was like oh I'm not going to do any of this but then I would
backslide and I would be lukewarm like I would go like three good years of not doing that and trying to like impress
the people at church with like my good behavior and then I would backslide and
um and then depression came back and it came back even worse like I like just
was so so sad so sad and a lot of good things were happening in my life like I
you know got back into school and it it um I like I went to Community College
first and then I got into a um four year so like great things were happening but I was just so depressed so um so the
Depression was even worse than before you were a Christian yeah like it was
like it was like I felt like and when I first you know accepted Jesus I felt like I didn't feel any depression I
didn't feel it I was like it's gone that's why that's when I knew that being close to God he takes away those things
so I was like it's gone but then as I got back into the world it came back and it came back even worse um and then so
yeah like like years later down the line like um I moved to New York for a year
and I was you know a nanny and I was living in the Hampton it was such a fun experience um and I after that I moved
back to LA so this was 2021 at this point and that is when I
the Depression was so bad that I was like I have to go to like a a talk therapy like I I was like I have to do
something and I ended up meeting a psychiatrist and then they diagnosed me
with general anxiety disorder um uh depression and bipolar depression so at
that point like a lot of my behavior was also very manic erratic because I was
smoking I was smoking weed I was addicted I was very addicted to weed um so I uh lived in that and I was taking
all the medicine and I felt like God did not want me to because and this is
before knowing anything about Deliverance it just was like messing up like my brain like I could feel like electricity pulsing through my brain and
I was thinking I'm like Lord like is this what you like in order to feel happy but I was feeling better I was
feeling happier but I was like I just don't think that this is like Freedom like still again that now knowing the
concept of freedom and peace and joy like I was like this just doesn't feel like that so the smoking the weed like
kind of numbed like it kind of oh it was an escape it like made things kind of better but it was bondage it wasn't fre
Bond exactly I was still smoking while I'm taking prescription medicine like antis psychotics all that and um I was
like Lord like please like how like you helped me with take this away um and you
know so I spent you know another year again like I I like say like I had like
different eras so like 22 2022 was like my hot girl era like that was like me
like really like embracing the world and clubbing and you know like wanting to date and all this stuff like that and um
I I finally got to a point where I was like Lord I'm really I'm really going to
go this time you know and I had told my family I told them like you know I I that's what I want um and then you going
to go like I wanted to leave of this earth like I wanted to kill myself so I was so the Suicidal Thoughts came back
like they were gone at first when you gave your life to Jesus right and then they came back when everything else came
back like depression depression and everything like that and at that point like I I felt like I had done so much
cuz I I used to go to like a old uh my old church and you know I was behaving
behaving so that like I can be rewarded and like you know get close like it was
all about being a certain way you can get closer to the pastors and you can be seen right and I just was like I don't
want to do this anymore I was like I don't want to do this anymore I just want to be in my hot girl my hot girl era I was in my hot girl era and then I
I was like Lord I'm so empty and I was like there there's literally nothing there's nothing here for me like there's
nothing here for me um I can't live with these thoughts in my head like I
describe it as this like somebody 24/7 like like you wake up you should die you
should die like her those voices in your head all the time all the time if like a
minor like someone your your tire could pop and you know it's like someone be like oh just call AAA you know I would
be like this is why I need to die this is why this is why like and and that
really opens up eyes I think a lot of people are judgmental for people who have tried to commit suicide and have
committed suicide yeah like how how you know how can you do this to your children to your family members but it's
like it's like a possession like it's like a control like it's you can't think
of anything else and so it's very difficult to not listen to that voice
yeah cuz it's so constant so it was like uncountable times throughout every day
yes like it was like torment like every day it was it was like having like like I've seen like cartoons of like um like
I I forgot what it's called it's like something where it's like showing like the little like emotions like sadness
you know like like and when I watched I was like oh that really explains it was like having like somebody like walking
with me like and like you can't even really enjoy fun moments because you're it's going to be like it's going to
steal your joy like you're not even you don't even have the concept of joy and peace like you never have a peaceful
moment like so that's why I would smoke weed because I would go to a different world I wouldn't be here you know and
that's what really drove my addiction like to the point where if like I didn't even have like my last $20 I would spend
on because it's better than being an hour in my own skin with my own thoughts wow so yeah so this is this is demons
yeah the world needs to know this is demons this is what's behind it yeah and
there's there's hope there's Freedom you can be free of all of this you don't have to live with this you don't have to
listen to the voices you don't have to commit suicide they can go in a second they can go and never come back I never
thought like this is like when when I I first got delivered I was like oh my goodness like they're gone like they're
really gone and it's I've never had like any type of thought like that like when
it like now when the voices come I literally laugh like I'm like oh like and and also like I'll sh share with you
like that the process of even coming to 5f I really got to like it's like the Holy Spirit kind of like opened up the
veil and I really got to see like these are like serious like demons who like it
is like their job like they are on assignment yeah to do this like it's like they're clocking in every day and
they're the employee of the month and I'm just like I'm just like oh like this is your job so I know that you're going
to keep on trying to come back but I'm always going to reject you because this is my body you can't have you can't have
you can't tell me what to do like you can't do that you don't own me like I
have peace so anyways but um yeah so to go back yeah you're explaining about the
Suicidal Thoughts every got worse everything got worse I want to now I want you to share how you made it to 5f
if there's anything more you want to share too that we're missing I want I want to hear the full scope of the bondage yeah like every detail you know
yeah no that I mean we're at this point 2022 is like the end of the year that
was like where I was at my lowest and then the top of the year January 2023 is
when I it was my birthday like my birthday's in January and um God told me for my
my uh I my birthday was really tough CU I didn't have a job and I just was like
Lord like I'm giving you some time I'm giving you some time and he was just like I have a birthday present for you
he's like don't worry he's like I have something for you and then um all of a sudden like an opportunity to work at a
record label had just dropped into my lap and I had always wanted to work at a record label I always wanted to like be
a music executive so I was like Lord It's it this is it this is it like this is going to solve all my problems make
me so happy like you know um I was like okay Lord I'm ready and I started the
first week of the job and it was like all the demons were like it's like they
knew like they knew their time was about to be up and I started in the top of February and I felt so much like it's
like I can like I was aware of my bondage like I was aware that like I
can't handle the pressure of being here because all I want to do is smoke like all I want to do is like be high but I
have like to take Serious notes like these are these are important meetings and and also like I had like lustful um
like thoughts like towards like um older men and sometimes they were married and
I didn't know but I would have these like lustful thoughts and that and like it's like if you think like that in this
environment you're you're going to have such a terrible reputation so I was like Lord like help me you know and um so by
that time it was it was the Wednesday of the week that I started and I cried out to go I was like I'm undone I was like
please like I really want everything to be gone like please so then I had a dinner with my cousin on Thursday and my
cousin and I had not talked for a little bit but we like rekindled and she came to La for she lives in New York but she
came for to La for a week and I was telling her about you know what I'm
experiencing and she was like oh that reminds me of this uh this podcast I watched of this girl who was talking
about her Deliverance it wasn't somebody from 5f it was just a girl talking about her Deliverance story with her pastors
and I watched that video after and then I called my cousin and I was like what she's talking about like I need that I
need Deliverance like I need somebody to take these things out of me like this is what is happening and then my cousin the
time I called her she was actually at my aunt's house and my aunt follows you yeah and she was saying oh she's like
that's so funny I was just at our Auntie's house and she was talking about this woman in La that does deliverance
and you know she's a powerful woman of God and you live in the LA area you're like what yeah I was just like oh I'm I
was like okay send her to me so I watched the videos and as soon as I started watching the videos I started crying I started crying and I started
and I was looking at I was just like Lord there are a lot of cameras and that's another thing I was always such a
perfectionist that like I didn't want anyone to know what I was going through so I would come you know all nice
stressed up but I would be going through so much torment so much bondage but acting like everything is okay so I
didn't want anyone to see what I'm going through and all the the all the things the nasty things are in me but I was
just like Lord like I I fear that I'm really going to have to go in front of those cameras um but I I didn't care and
by that so on Friday so now we're at Friday and there was a video and the
Holy Spirit told me to watch your video of how to receive total healing and deliverance cuz I was like maybe I don't
have to go maybe I can just watch this video get a quick fix and I'll be good for good for the you know the role and
then I was like oh I I I was watching it and that day I you know came home really
late but the Holy Spirit was like I want you to watch it so I was watching it and the message was about what I was going
through like with work and everything and I was like Wow and then all of a sudden at this point it's 3:00 a.m. and
at this point like I just hear you say now get up grab all the cursed things and my body my literally at that point I
just feel like the Lord had already it was already going cuz my body I stood up and I was so tired but I stood up you
were like get up get all this your cursed items we're going to throw it away all of what the cursed items the
cursed items cursed items so you you said like get like get out it had demonic attachments to it exactly like
you shared about that and you were like grab them and I was like this is going to take a long time because I have them
everywhere like I had weed stash everywhere I had like a random like fixation on like San Rio which is like
Hello Kitty like one of them it was called Melody and like I had like the plushies everything and I and even to
everyone around me it did not make sense it just was like a random fixation on like that type of like stuff and like
Harley Quinn like anime like and it was just so it was not like in my character it just was like one day I decided I
liked it and I just got everything of it um what is Harley Quinn I remember you renounced that and I didn't know what it
was yeah Harley Quinn um is like a like a a character in in DC um movies the
comics and she's the Joker's uh like partner okay and she's
just very like like she was she's like very double-minded and she's like kind of crazy and that was so you had like a
fixation that and like her acting like her acting and
especially acting like her when I would have like a boyfriend and I'm having
like you know relations yeah I would act like her wow because I would always feel
so guilty afterwards or like guilty during like I because the Holy Spirit just always has like talk like I've
always been very aware of of somebody like of voices like Spirit like I don't
know how to explain it but like I guess I just you know how like I feel like kids are very like in touch with the
spiritual realm and I've since I was a kid I've always been aware like heard
but I never knew what these things were or anything like what is talking to me so I would always hear like this is not
good but I would be like ah you know that's just like me feeling bad and in
order to get through you know being sexual in this way I would say I'm going
to take on the spirit of Harley Quinn I'm like I'm Harley Quinn and that's what I would you would actually say that
out loud I said it yeah I said which is an Open Door yeah which is I didn't didn't know to say that yeah it's like
inviting it in yeah I did not know and and yeah so that was why it was important for you to rounce that and I
didn't understand it I did understand it when it when I did that but I had to say it so yeah so I I um I I grabbed all the
items and by that time it was 6:00 a.m. so I I and and then I went to the garage
cuz I didn't want to be loud just in case I'm coughing or anything CU I had seen people in the videos like you know crying so I went to the garage and I
remember like at this point I had my earphones in and I'm hearing you like starting to like you know like declare
and I and I just hear a voice say you know lay on your back put the put the
phone on your chest lay on your back and wait for them to come and I did not understand what what was happening but I
was like oh maybe the wait for them to come is my family like maybe my family will come and rescue me and everything
and all of a sudden it was like like I describe it as like me I'm laying on the
floor right here and but this is like my inner man like my my inner man is like
right here and it's like I dropped down and all the demons came through so I I
was laying on I said like screaming like bloody murder
and it's and so that was the first time you manifested yes and it was a whole big manifestation and you had thrown
things out at this point yeah I thrown everything threw everything away so now they were losing their Authority oh
they're losing their legal Authority I never understood wow so that's why they because before they weren't even manifesting well we need the anointing
also the power of God to come to the surface be exposed and come out but they were starting to lose their Authority at
that point their legal rights over you oh yeah cuz I threw away so much I even
threw away like all like what was like you know like I was throwing away like all like different like clothes that you
know like I was using to like you know gain attention of men like I the hot girl the hot girl ARA clothes everything
like all of the weed in different hidden in different corners and then I just when I laid down it was just like they
all came through and I was screaming and it's like I was watching it like I'm watching I'm like wow like this is
really a real experience that's happening to you and you were just declaring and I was so scared and they
were so you were watching my video at this time the V the video is playing in my ears it's on my chest and it was when
I began declaring that this happened that this happened I'm screaming and in the garage and now my whole family
person because it's like so scary like and and I'm like and I'm like oh like up
now and I'm like screaming like help me and I'm choking myself because the demons are doing that to you yeah I'm
choking myself I'm screaming like help me help me and also like I have like
super strength I'm like pushing them and everyone knows in my family like I'm not really a fighter like you know and I I I
I respect it but like my they were really scared because I had so much power like the demons yeah gave you
power gave you power and they were holding me down ping my face and my aunt
at the time like she you know I I've seen her like pray for people and she prayed for me one time and I like

demons or something like and they knew like my siblings knew specifically like I had been going through so they were
like this is not bad but my aunt was like you know like how in the name of Jesus and like like Not only was the the
demons trying to choke me they were trying to like really like choke me they were choking me everyone was choking me
because they were P pushing my head down pushing my chest down like and I and I I
my Consciousness like it I couldn't say please like get off me like I can't breathe so they were keeping me like
silent and I was speaking in different voices I was laughing I was saying like
really like scary stuff and my like everyone it looked like they had just seen a ghost like everybody in the room
was so scared um to the point where my dad he called 911 and he just was like
come and help you know he was like come and help and I remember that um at this
point the the the they were trying to do was going on for like two hours
so the yeah the the ambulance came in they they tried the firefighters and they were like can you like like where
is she where is she and I remember that that they had moved away from me for like my family so I was just alone and I
heard you need to get up right now and act like you're okay because if not they're going to take you and they they
might think you mental mental problem so but I don't know and until this day I
don't really know like was it the was it the Holy Spirit like who was there was so many voice like it was like sitting
back and watching a whole bunch of like different people like like have
authority over my body and they're discussing so I just listened to that voice and I I remember I got up and at
that time at that point like my body was contorting in different ways like but I just remember my body like lifting up
like somebody was Lifting me you know and I lifted up and I was walking and I was like sauntering like sauntering and
so my my whole family is like please take her like please take her but like seductively you mean seductively and I
was like sauntering very seductively and the firefighters were just like ma'am do you need help and I remember I was like
No And they were like and the like it was like was the demons you mean or yes it was the demon the demons yeah and
like the firefighters were like we're out they were they were they were they
were scared they were scared yeah like I've never seen that because I would think that they would still take the
me but it was like that demon was like no I do not need help wow you know I'm
okay and they were like we can't help her she's like we can't she says she doesn't want help we're out so they left
and my dad was just like I don't know what to do and my dad like he just walked away from the situation again
they tried to do it in the now we're in the kitchen we're not in the garage anymore they're trying to do you know Deliverance everything like that it's
not working and then and then that's when I heard the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit said get up go take a shower
they cannot help you I want you to not eat I don't want you to eat just drink
water you're going to go to Apostle Catherine's church on Sunday and this was Friday was it Happ now was this a
Saturday morning Saturday morning Friday night and Saturday morning Frid wow yeah so it was like ER but but spiritual ER
like God's like I'm sending you to the spiritual ER like go to the hospital like the the church the of God is
exactly and at that point I hadn't and Friday like I didn't really eat much so it was like the beginning of a fast like
and he's like I don't want you and this explains why you were even so much in desperation because that was kind of
pretty terrifying to you I'm sure like you you knew you probably didn't know you had like demons like possessing you
I knew I was a troubled youth but not like like it was a lot of them like a
lot of them and like they were like this is our home and you heard them say that
yes and what did you feel when you heard that I'm honestly it it was I at that
point it was it's it's like in hindsight it's kind of funny because I'm just it's it was almost like in the spiritual
realm or wherever my Consciousness was I was like huh this explains why I try to
do this and like this this demon talks to me this one like so I'm like ah I
might I'm probably not that lustful like so it was like a relief I was just like I'm probably not
that bad of a person like I'm prob you guys are are like like I'm looking at traits of my personality that I have
said I'm just like this but I'm not you will know the truth and the truth will set you free so even before you were
free you were already being freed in the mind yeah and now I bet even you didn't
want to kill yourself you know it's a demon that wants me to kill myself but my people perish because of lack of
knowledge they kill themselves because of lack of knowledge that it's demonic oppression this is what it is it's not
you these aren't truths and you can be free of this Hallelujah yeah so you then so you
didn't eat for all Saturday no didn't eat all Saturday now that was wise and definitely led by the holy spirit
because I will say that it it's not like a when it comes to fasting a lot of people do it
religiously even like okay it's January it's time to fast like it can be done so
religiously like shutting off the Holy Spirit just like oh it's January fasting time like this is what we do in the
church or something but um it needs to be holy spirit L and so
anyways that was definitely Holy Spirit L when there is especially when there is severe demonic oppression like we're
talking many demons and just many entanglements of those chains it is wise
it is wise to fast it is because it's it's making their grip less as strong
wow it's making your spirit to rise up and the flesh part of you the carnal part of you to diminish it's not saying
that like every time every single person fasts they're automatically more spiritual it has to be led by the
spirit so that was powerful that and led by the holy spirit that you fasted then
before coming so then it was Sunday and you came to fold church for the first time yes yeah so that that Saturday I I
actually went left my home and I slept at work and I I didn't know how it was
going to work because um I was just like oh Lord like I don't have you know like I changeing clothes like I don't have
any of that I was like maybe like I'll get up early and like go you know to Target somewhere somewhere um and I
remember that like the Holy Spirit was just like no I want you to like sing like want you to sing so I was like is
this the morning on Sunday I'm waking up at my job and they had like a little area where you could like it's like
couches and stuff so I was like singing and then the Holy Spirit was like I was like Lord like I have to let's let's
hurry up with the singing because I have to go find clothes and stuff like that and he was just like no like I want you
to worship and then he's like got a he's like get a pen and pad out and start writing down and this is what you're
going to say and I just was like okay and I just was listening to what he was
saying and writing everything down and by the time that I was writing it down it was almost one and I was like no I
was like Lord what am I going to do I don't have clothes and he just was like do you care about the smell goods and
looking all nice do you care about or do you want to go and I was like okay so I look up where the church is and it was
five minutes away wow five minutes away which okay those are people that don't
live La don't know what a miracle that is no it La you can it can take two and a half hours or more to get from one
area of LA to another that's amazing like it was literally down the street wow I was like and this is a like a
record label like right down this I was like what like so I yeah wait I just
want I just want to ask you this though first so you took the shower let's go back to you took the
shower oh Saturday morning Satur morning so did the demons kind of subside like they kind of went back into hiding yes
and okay so they your family members eventually tried like stopped they stopped and they started arguing amongst
themselves and then the demons kind of just they they went away so they went away for all of that Saturday all that Saturday I could still hear them though
like still hear them wasn't like manifesting it wasn't manifesting yeah so then comes Sunday five minutes away
you come to church five full Church yeah I come and I walk in and I remember when
I walked in the old building like the white building and literally like I
that's when they started manifesting again and my face like I was pouting and I was just like like they were like what
is this what are they doing like like like I remember like I hearing some of
them saying like we hate the sunshine how there's sun shining it was so weird like I was just like you guys are just
mad like you guys are really like you they really hated what they were seeing like when I remember seeing like the people dancing with the worshiping and
and they were just like like everything was making me so angry the singing everything and I just was like okay let
me sit in the back because I don't want to be embarrassed like how like if if
what was happening at my house was to happen like during it would have been so
embarrassing so I just was like well that's what I was thinking that now I know it's freedom but um yeah so I just
listened to the I tried I didn't worship I just was in the back and I just was you know and then after the sermon goes
and it's ex it's exactly what I needed to hear and then it's time for Ministry time so you were able to hear the
message still I hear yeah I heard the oh yeah I heard and I was taking notes because they I feel like the Holy Spirit
was just like allowing me to hear like like it was like they would be subdued
sometimes they wouldn't by the grace of God yeah so by that by the end of the
sermon like I was like okay like it's Ministry time time and I remember um like I didn't I I remember I had that
pen and pad with all the the stuff I kept it in my bag cuz I was just like Lord like just deliver me how you want
like I don't want to do all that cuz that it had instructions to say my full government name and I didn't want to be
embarrassed like that I was like I'm just in and out and then I'm you know so I went up to the front and like you know
people started being free and there was a girl and next to me and we both looked
at a woman dropped down and we started Bing crying cuz we were just like oh wow
so then the girl next to me then she goes up you call her up and then I and then I'm looking and I'm like okay I'm
like you know you're walking back and forth and I'm like if it's time my time to get delivered like she has to calm me
she has to calm me like it has to be like a special moment and the Holy Spirit was like you want to bet on that
you after what you experience you really want to say oh yeah if she calls on me
it's like you better run run for your life and then I was like okay fine so I I had to go back to my seat to go get
the pen and Pad cuz I was like being disobedient and thinking like oh yeah just do it really quick I got my pen and
pad and I ran I said please help me help me please and you were you know so kind
and you let me come up and you let me renounce the whole thing like I did I I
was even thinking I'm like I'm not going to this is such a it was like three pages like three or four pages and you
let me say the whole thing and I just remember that like when I first like said it I just kept on saying like God
like please don't let it be like how it was at the house like that was so scary it was really like really scary like I
I've and my body was sore even after that like for two weeks because I just have never contorted body in that way so
I was like please don't let it and then I just remember I dropped down and everything but it it was it was so much
more painless it was it was quick like they anointing anointing like it it it
wasn't like a struggle like and I feel like God really had me experience like what like it looks like when people who
do not have anointing try to do Deliverance it's all of them praying and
and the demons are like beating them up like I was yeah because even if you're a Christian with but you don't have power
the power of God demons are more powerful yeah because demons have true Supernatural power see you're a
powerless Christian versus a p a demon who has power in a person yeah we need
the power of God we do we do cuz it was so quick it was so quick and they they
were leaving and it was like like I I remember like it was like a spirit of Vengeance that came out and I didn't
hear that one that one was very quiet like that one was very quiet the whole time I didn't I didn't feel it hear it
but like when I was renouncing and I said a spirit of Vengeance like it came out and that was something that I dealt
with always like um like having an underdog type of uh spirit or it's like
just being like I'm an underdog and like when I make it all the people that ever treated me wrong are going to feel it
like I didn't know that it was such bondage and it was keeping me from loving people like being at 5f I've been
totally delivered of that and like I'm learning how to like fall in love with like loving like Jesus loving people you
know um so yeah and after that I just stayed on the stage for such a long time
because God was like yeah I remember like I like someone posted a picture or video of like the whole team tearing
down everything and they were like leaving the stage for last because you were still laying there receiving from God I was receiving I was it was like
Bliss like it was like Bliss and I just was there and and I I even was like okay like when I was hearing them take it
down I was like okay it's time for me to go and I almost felt like I couldn't get up like I was like I'm not done and he
was like and he's like you've already been filmed do you really care he's like do you really care about
what people say now and I remember finally like when I got up it was like good morning and like like and and yeah
someone said good morning to you right yeah Stone said good morning to me and he gave me a white rose I still have it
to this day it's dried out and I have it in my room decorated so nice and I just
was like that I I remember singing and and also before like I would sing and
because I was smoke all the time my throat was always like I would always crack and it didn't sound good but that
like it was like a sweet sound like that was like when I first like started like oh I I God did you give me a new voice
like that's what it I I felt and I was just singing and so happy and like I had
braids at the time and like God was like take down your braids love your hair like he's like love so I ever ever since
then like I love my hair like I love my and that's a big thing like you know with you know black women like it's
sometimes hard to love your hair but ever since then like I see myself how God sees me so beautiful like naturally
so yeah and like it's just been so great ever since when you were on the stage you said it was Bliss can you explain
more like once the demons left so they like all you felt you felt them left you sense them left like how or leave how
did you know they left like were their voices and then they were gone what what was that like if you can explain that
like immediate moment after deliverance and then like the next hour or so laying there in Bliss it was I couldn't hear
the voices anymore I couldn't hear any type of like it was literally like like
they were let out of a door and the door was closed like and and it was soundproof it was quiet that was the
first time that I ever experienced what it feels like to have peace in my mind like peace in my mind no bad thoughts
nothing like just peace happiness joy like I felt Joy I was like this what Joy
feels like I was like this is better than any drug I've ever tried in my life like I was like this is like this is
where I want to be like this is where I want to stay and I the Bliss that I was feeling it just was like I don't it was
almost like God was like rocking me like a baby like rocking me and like showing
me like this is like what peace is this is what Joy is this this like the fact
that like you are in a room full of people you don't care you just have joy and you're just focused on me
and that was like I was like like almost like God like I want to stay here like
with my whole walk with you I always want to be like that and after you know
that Deliverance I say that peace and joy is my default I like anytime that
something comes to disturb it I know that it's an attack on my peace it's an attack on my joy and I'm like I go to
God immediately and I also resist the devil and he will flee that has that principle that you have shared like
helps so much because you know immediately the devil wants to come and be like um attacked like that that
perfectionism that I had you know renounced the devil's like H you
should be so embarrassed you should be so embarrassed this is going to go everywhere and you know even after like
I I I didn't want to come back to 5f I didn't and but I because of the the like
the devil would lie the devil would lie and say like not the Demons Inside but the devil would lie outside yeah and I
knew immediately that I do not feel it internally it was like it was like almost like somebody was like like
knocking like hey hey hey and I'm like that's powerful that shows the difference between demons from within
it's almost like it's your own thoughts and you can't get rid of them yes like I
want to kill myself I want to kill myself or whatever like you can't get but then when it's outward it's like they're knocking and
you don't have to let them in yeah and when you reject him he has to flee is that what you found yes oh yeah like it
was it the it was I I think that like suicide was the one that I feel like Jesus really like slayed that one
because it couldn't it couldn't even lie to me and trick me and say like you like um kill yourself like it was like it had
to come back and it was like you want like you want to kill yourself and I'm like you're not even saying like I want
to kill like you're not even using like I at this point you know that I know that you're a liar so I was just like no
like I do not want to like I am not depressed I am not embarrassed like I'm
GNA keep coming to 5f I'm G to keep on coming and receiving and like that's what the Holy Spirit instructed me he
was just like you need to stay under this anointing like you need to stay under this waterfall and then I feel
like you preached maybe the like very very um early on to like as I was coming
about the waterfall and being like a sponge or a rock or and I was like I'm just going to be under here and not try
to like you know go on and like I'm going to teach you about Deliverance or I just was like I just need to receive
and um I just have been free ever since I'm I'm literally like and so crazy
after my family you know it went viral yeah and my it I didn't think that my
family would see it but it went viral and you know um they saw it and people
were like you know it's a big how did they see it on Facebook on Facebook it went viral like it just showed up and it
showed up on my mom's for you page on the for you yes so it really went all over the it went all over and then she
was a bit surprised she was shocked she was shocked and at this time they were so traumatized about what happened no
one was talking to me only my siblings were talking to me they were so traumatized but at this point they're
getting like me like calls texts from different people in the community because so they're seeing it too they're
like for you Pages yeah they're seeing it and it's like a thing of like when you're Nigerian like it can be like oh
dishonor on the family shame so but my my parents and this is the first time that I saw that they it was like the
Holy Spirit was really flowing like the anointing was flowing throughout my whole family because they were just like
we don't care are you okay like are you okay like and from then on like as I
continued to go to 5f and then when I accepted you as my spiritual mother my relationship with my mom it's like a
newborn baby like I love her so much she loves me so much like my parents like
they they're like we don't care about any anything that you from your past or
with the video or anything you are a different person like they know that I'm Different they see the change they see

you yeah Hallelujah flourish conference just
happened recently in April in Los Angeles and it was such a powerful move
of God like the day of Pentecost yes and Beyond I wanted to ask you what was your
experience at flourish oh yeah at flourish I I definitely came into it
like oh I'm just like my priority is just serving like you know but I did know that like the Lord revealed to me
that week that I had pride in relationships cuz cuz I had renounced
Pride so I was like no Lord like I I'm I I'm rejecting that like and the Holy Spirit was like no this is a different
type of Pride it's like when you have like a a spat with somebody or a a
disagreement you are like I will never I will never smile at you again I will never be nice to you again like you
won't get that of me like having pride of like withholding my love and I was like I cannot serve your people if I
have this God like I was like help me like take this out like cuz I understand now like if I'm so open to God
correcting me cuz after you get delivered like that so wildly from so many different things that cause you to
like not be a good person you like are like it's done like it's done like I'm
good like you're just going to like you know grow me but when God like corrects you and tells you you still have things
need to be delivered from it can like be like oh really but now being at 5f and
maturing you know being here I'm like oh I'm happy to hear like things that God
wants to take out of me so I was like okay Lord like I'm I I'm believing that you're going to deliver me from Pride
within relationships so I I you know was serving but I was expectant and that was
the first thing that you preached about on the first night you were like some of you need to renounce Pride I was like
that's me and I so I renounced it and I just
wept and like from then then on like I was like Lord like I believe that I'm delivered from this and now I want to
walk in this healing so like I just like felt like such a like love for people
like uh and before like I would um like you know people like messaging me on
social media like if I didn't like the way that they were or like if it made me uncomfortable I would like I'm never going to talk to you but like seeing
people like I was like so like it doesn't matter like I just want to like say hi and talk to everybody and that's
just wasn't who I was very like shy but I was like no like I I want to I I want
to talk to different people I Want to Love on different people so that's like a immediate and that was like second day

all over like it was giving me chills like it was giving me chills and I was like wow this is a really interesting
