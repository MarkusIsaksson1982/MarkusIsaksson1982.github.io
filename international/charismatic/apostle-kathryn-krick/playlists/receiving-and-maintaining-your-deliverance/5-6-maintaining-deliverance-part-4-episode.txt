it's been a powerful past few weeks here as we've been in a series of how to
maintain your deliverance it's become a four-part series this will
be the last part today and I've been going so in depth because this
is so vital just as important as receiving Deliverance is knowing how to
maintain your deliverance being equipped to keeping your deliverance and
especially because this is a kind of spiritual food that is not offered much
Deliverance is so rare in the body of Christ today and so there's not the
knowledge the equipping or teaching for the most part of how to maintain your deliverance so so often people they hear
oh it can be free and they come they come zealous and they get free Hallelujah but they have no clue that
there's a next part to this that they have to do which is being intentional to maintain
their freedom that they have to play a part in this they have to take this seriously because this is spiritual this
is the devil we're talking about the devil does not want people in Freedom to be free he doesn't want people to stay
free so he will try to to steal the Deliverance to come back
as we learned in the verse that the scripture that says when one demon goal is he's looking to come back with more
he's looking to see that if it's open if it's vacant if it's warm the passion
translation says in other words not filled with the Holy Spirit and not
transformed inside transformed by the spirit inside and filled with the spirit but it's staying
the same as how they left it then they they legally are able to return in the
spiritual Realm so um this is why it's so important why we've been going so in depth so I urge
you I urge you please go back and watch how to maintain your deliverance part one part two part three and then today
will be part four I also urge you to bookmark these to save these links and
go back to them make it a practice to return to these to meditate on these and go back listen again
so your mind can be transformed you can be your mind can be renewed as
you hear the word of God the Rhema spoken word of God and the locals word of God that I share in the messages amen
Hallelujah
so I just want to kind of give you a just a little summary if this is your first time if you
haven't heard the other three weeks I just want to give you a little quick summary of what we've gone through the
other weeks of how to maintain your deliverance surrender complete surrender to God Is So vital is so important
to to close doors to close spiritual doors
doors that were open for demons to come through sin and through
door like areas where you're not being obedient to God like keeping relationships that you shouldn't be
keeping for example you need to be serious about closing every door so that
demons do not have any legal access to come in they have legal access when you leave a door open when we disobey God
through sin by leaving a door open this can even be speaking words of death that's sin
so close the doors also fill yourself with the Holy Spirit
um and so I I talked in depth what that means to fill yourself with the Holy Spirit there's a lot to it so you can
find that in the previous messages on the the second one and then also you
must remember that we are called to fight the good fight of faith and that we are in a spiritual war that we are
not in vacation mode spiritually ever be on vacation in real life but we're
always on the battlefield we're always on call we're always on call and rhymes with my
dad in my hometown um it's my hometown there's 1200 people in the whole town and there's still no
cell phone service and because of that in order for there to be firemen and um
EMT it has to be volunteer and so my precious dad and most of the
members in the church I grew up in they are all volunteers for for many decades
they have my dad the plectron would go off at three in the morning it's eight in the morning opening up presents on
Christmas morning Dad would go off to being on the EMT to go help someone or
be in a fireman go fighting fires for free no no pay
um and so but like even Christmas morning you know he would have to go sometimes I remember as a kid
so it's like that we're in the spiritual realm maybe we're on vacation but we
can't go to sleep we can't go to vacation in the spiritual realm we have to always be on call we have to always be alert as the Bible says be aware be
vigilant for that for the devil Roars around like a lion seeking whom he can devour so we have to always be aware we
have to to know what we're called to we're called to be Warriors we're called we got to be on call amen
so you I mean to maintain your deliverance you have to be aware of this
battle and you have to be always ready to fight the good fight of faith you have to be ready you have to know that
there's going to come a time when the devil will try to attack and it's so important you don't let him win you
don't sit there and let him beat you up and then come back in but that you you
get up out of that chair in the spiritual realm and you get to work you go to war you go to battle and you walk
in the authority that Jesus has given you you have authority over demons you
have authority over all attacks of the devil all of these weapons these outward weapons formed against you I talked last
week about how when you have demonic oppression when when you have demons
they're inside and it's real bondage it's like a chain around you and that's why people fast
and they pray and they try to do so much I mean they're praying for hours and hours and nothing's happening the
bondage Still Remains because it's the anointing that destroys the yoke it's the power of God that sets people
free we saw people we see people be free in the acts Church by people positioning
themselves where the anointing was flowing like Peter they came to where he was ministering it says the shadow would
touch the sick and demand possessed and all of them were freed and healed so we see this is how people were being free
the anointing the power of God moving through vessels is what destroys the yoke
so that's inward demons and then so once you're free you don't have Demons Inside but you have the devil
attacking from the outside but you're not in bondage anymore so you need to make sure that you are not uh giving
into the devil's lies that says I'm inside and you can't do anything about it you need to seek more Deliverance
you need to make sure that when you are free you are being firm and fighting the good fight
of faith and walk in your Authority and rejecting the devil resisting him because the Bible says when you resist
him he must flee amen a big important part of maintaining
Deliverance is also being planted where God's power is being planted in a church where God's power is because that's how
you're going to receive the equipping equipping like you're receiving today of this these are the sneaky schemes of the
devil and this is how you overcome them meat in the spiritual realm your spiritual
eyes being opened so that's just a brief summary covering uh the past few weeks and now today
we're going to come to the next the next important key to maintaining your deliverance
and this one is to testify
to testify of what God has done to testify of your
deliverance it says in Revelation 12 11. and they
overcame him by the blood of the Lamb that's Jesus
by his blood and there is an and
we overcome the devil because of Jesus's blood in our lives his grace because of what he did on the cross so that now we
have authority over the devil we never have to lose to him because of what Jesus did his blood shed
by the blood of the Lamb we overcome and there's an end and by the word of
their testimony
the Bible tells us here this is a key of how to be victorious over the devil of
how to overcome his attacks is to testify
this is a spiritual thing we're talking about to testify
there's there's power in your testimony there's there's many amazing powerful things that happen when you testify for
one this is how God gets the most Glory if if we withhold our testimonies maybe
we're giving God glory in other parts of our lives but if we're not testifying we are withholding Glory from God
he's not getting all the glory so we're this is how we give God the
glory and number two this is how people are saved
it's how they will come to know that Jesus is real
he's alive he is loving he can deliver them he can deliver and heal people
this is how people know when we testify God did this for me my life used to be
like this and now my life is like this and he loves you like he loves me so God
will do the same thing he did for me for you he will deliver you and heal you too come to him
give him a try seek him you'll find them
[Applause] it says in John 4 28.
there was a Samaritan woman at the well Jesus Jesus ends up prophesying to the
Samaritan woman the power of God moves through Jesus by the by his prophetic
word that's a big way that God moves in power and shows his love to people and comes
in a way that opens us your spiritual eyes to know he's real and his his intimate
love for you is the prophetic word amen
and so he demonstrated the power of God came through Jesus
the anointing as he prophesied to this American woman as he spoke of things that's in her life that she
has several men in her life and which was very sinful in those days
even more looked down upon in society in those days but you know he did it not in
a condemning way not what's wrong with you you're bad no but you can see by her
reaction of how she reacted to Jesus after he prophesied to her that it was done with
such love that as he prophesied to her it wasn't it was done with love like I know I know
what you're going through I know your life I know the hidden things
but I love you anyway I love you no matter what you've done and I am your lord and I am your savior
and I want you give to give your life to me like that's what was happening in this interaction with the Samaritan woman at the well and so she comes to
know you are the Messiah and she is so amazed by the love that
she encountered the power she encountered through the prophetic word through Jesus she just wanted the whole world to know
this Jesus that she had just encountered amen and so she the Bible says after
this Encounter With Jesus John 4 28.
the woman went back to the town and said to the people so she left her water jar she went
really far away to get water and she just left the water
jar there because she was so overcome all that mattered was to testify
and so it says verse 29 come see a man who told me everything I ever did could
this be the Messiah they came out of the town and made their way toward him
many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony
many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of why
her testimony her testimony made people to be saved
may people be healed and delivered and touched by God her testimony was the reason
he told me everything I ever did so when the Samaritans came to him they urged him to stay with him and he stayed
the two days and because of his because of his words many more became believers they said to the woman we no longer
believe just because of what you said now we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man really is the savior
of the world so this is how powerful your testimony is that when you speak people receives a
Measure of Faith The Measure of Faith that's required that's needed to help
them to seek God to seek Jesus like these people did they went they were
like we gotta check this him out because of what she said we have a Measure of Faith now to go see
and now they got to actually encounter him for themselves and now they were able to be saved
and he'll deliver touched by God so oh there's power in your testimony this is
we need to realize how important this is it's one of the biggest ways that God
wants to use his people use all of you um but we haven't even gotten to the the
the other powerful part of your testimony so these are two of the powerful parts of your testimony but
it's also how you overcome the devil
this is another powerful thing that your testimony does and so what happens is
when you are not um following the commands of God
through his word that have been now illuminated to you through this through these teachings the
past few weeks amen like as I've shared every key of
how to maintain your deliverance has not just been me speaking it to you but it's coming from the word
it's Revelation from the Holy Spirit upon the word of God
so when you when you follow all of these commands from God
that now you really understand this is what it means I have the Revelation now when you do this
what happens is the devil sees he can't come back
the demons see he they can't come back it's like every door has been shut
because you followed what God has said to do to maintain your freedom and be
surrendered to him but if you get lazy
on one of these areas it becomes like an open door for the devil
it becomes this is how the demons came back because you neglected this key
so your testimony they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of
their testimony this is one of the big keys that when you testify literally it's like in the spiritual realm like a
door has been locked shut like if there's all these different keys that we've been learning are different doors that have locks another one has
been bolted locked shut so the devil can't come back in demons can't come back in when you testify
amen and so this is so important you have this revelation
so that you share your testimony and that you share it
with all your heart and that you share it as much as God wants you to share it so that you have strength and joy to
share your testimony because you have this revelation that all this good is going to come from
me sharing God's getting the glory many people will be saved healed and delivered and no demons can come back in
me this is how I overcome the devil is by testifying
this is this is why it's important you receive this word today because you need Revelation some of you just think of
testimony as going through the motions you don't think of it as how powerful it really is and how vital
it is for your life for your spiritual health and to stay free amen and so
um I want to share today the like how to testify like how to
testify properly because you could just be like really wimpy about it
and in the spiritual it could not count you know you're doing the bare minimum
with sharing your testimony yeah God is good he saved me
I testified it counts so it matters how you share your
testimony for some of you I mean you have
different parts of your testimony there's different parts in your life that God has done I want to speak specifically though on
uh deliverance and encounters with God's power that have really changed you
um like how to properly share them so for some of you some of your part
some parts of your testimony are comfortable for you to share but for some of you there's other parts
of your testimony that are really uncomfortable to share
but you still need to share them to overcome so you need to understand that yeah it's
it's uncomfortable for a lot of people to share but if you want to overcome the devil if
you want God to get the glory if you want people if you want God to use you to save other people you you need to get out of your comfort
zone and testify about it amen
do not be ashamed of Jesus do not be ashamed of Jesus your deliverer your healer
um for me my testimony
for me there's uncomfortable parts of it uncomfortable in the fact of
I know that some people won't like my testimony I know some people will reject me
because of my testimony by that I mean uh for one example my story is
is not like normal I mean not typical it's Unique
but how many of you know we need something unique and something new for God to do something new in the
church today if we're not seeing the power of God if we're not seeing healing Deliverance
it means we need something new and usually things that are new are seen by a lot of people as weird strange and
wrong many times the equivalent the weirdness that they see because they've never seen it before
the uniqueness of it as wrong as bad that's the skeptical Pharisee mindset
that's wrong that's the opposite of being childlike it's not being teachable but we should be childlike and know that we have so
much to learn that there's so much that we need from God there's new revelation we need from God so we're childlike we're ready for
God to confound us we're ready for God to teach us a new thing we're ready for Revelation from the scriptures to be
illuminated to us in a way we've never heard of before we're ready so when it comes we don't reject it when it comes
we don't think it's weird and strange we think this I believe is the new thing that I was waiting for and looking for
amen Hallelujah so for my story
um you know my spiritual father he's from a different country he's from East Africa and
I received impartation from my spiritual father it was my spiritual father first of all that prophesied that I was called
to be an apostle of Jesus Christ the word of God came through him and I
knew it was God and I believed it and I wanted to be in God's will so I I obeyed God
and then I received impartation I started the church about
within that year nine months after receiving that prophecy and I didn't see the power of God you know like tangibly
move at first every Sunday I wasn't seeing it and then about nine months
after I started the church I received more impartation I made a sacrifice I traveled to my
spiritual father propheter Davey his church in East Africa and Tanzania I came hungry I came expected to receive
impartation I became hungry I wanted to see God move in power in L.A at the
church and touch the people and I saw how God moved in power through my
spiritual father at his church with thousands of people I saw the power of God moved like never before
and I knew impartation was real I knew this was one of the biggest ways that God releases his anointing
so I came expecting and hungry and I received I fell back with the power of God and I instantly was
different I got on the plane a 24-hour plane ride and all I could do was read the Bible and pray I was on fire and at
the I was getting Revelation I never got before in my life when I was reading the word and it was a 24 25 hour trip and
normally you're so tired you watch movies and stuff the whole time I was
reading the word or praying and and crying out to God that he would move in
power the whole time I was like whoa I am changed already from this impartation
Hallelujah I was so much more spiritual and so full of the fire of the holy spirit so then I
came to church that day I mean that week that Sunday and I was so expected like
never before and Jean tall hadn't come to the church yet but her mom came first
and her dad and this is two weeks before she actually came they then invited her but at this on this day her mom was at
the front of the altar I laid my hand on her and she fell back with the power of God and I I was shocked because I never
seen God move in any kind of power through me as a vessel until that moment
and then from there the prophetic anointing Came Upon me and I started praying for a person and just words came
to me for the first time that never happened to me in my life I never saw anything prophetic no kind of prophetic
indication in my life at all until that moment after receiving impartation
and this person starts crying weeping as I'm praying for them and then I pray for
another person the same thing happens they're so touched and words are just coming
and so that was after receiving impartation about the anointing
and then God took me through a season in our church through a season uh several
year season about a four-year season of refining of molding of being prepared
for the promise being prepared for Revival to break out so we would so I would be transformed into the image of
God where God needed me to be to be able to lead well and take care of his Sheep amen there had to be a process
and so for a few years it was a total of about four and a half years I was
waiting on the promise but it was about three years three and a half years of just
ministering every week and our church being very small and seeing God move in power consistently since that day I
received that impartation I was we would see him move consistently in terms of prophetic Ministry people
being touched by the prophetic word and sometimes people falling back with the power of God and God just doing a work
and the baptism of the Holy Spirit but we didn't see more than that we praise God for that though because that was so
much compared to most places you know but we saw no Deliverance no demons
manifest no really healings or testimonies of healings um God was that was part of God taking
me through that refining process and building my faith that I would obey him no matter what no matter how much fruit
I would see no matter how much success or feeling like we're moving forward I would see and so four and a half years
after I heard the prophecy for the first time of am I calling to be an apostle
and I was called to reach the Nations and and about three and a half years after hearing the prophetic word that
also my spiritual father spoke Revival is now um
so that it was that it was years after that that the first demon manifested and
was cast out at our church service and um that anointing had been growing
in me and impartation had continued to flow in me until that moment that God
was ready to move like the anointing had grown in me but then there was a
specific moment where God would like unleash it like unleash the new level
for demons to be manifesting amen and that's what happened that day in
um March March 2021 March 21st 2021 and then from there the floodgates just
opened that anointing that had been growing was now just flowing constantly
and demons were manifesting every single service and people were being set free every single service and then 300 people
came two months later and Revival just broke out people being set free
everywhere and then it's just grown from there ever since that day about two years ago it's just grown and grown amen
and so a big part of my testimony of how I've
received this anointing from God and how we see demons flee and these amazing
testimonies this amazing testimony of a child being set free from autism in
Sweden because of the anointing moving online the the key the reason a big big reason
has to do with the fact that I have a spiritual father an amazing amazing
spiritual father the most uh I've never seen a Heart Like Jesus like
my spiritual father has and so from the character to how he walks in authority of Christ that's my
spiritual father and so I've received impartation and I've received a quipping
through him God used him just as God used Paul uh for Timothy and Elijah for
Elisha to equip me to teach me things in the spiritual realm to know how to walk
in authority in the spiritual realm to know how things work in the spiritual realm and the the power of God imparted
in Me itself a big reason for this is because of
doing things God's way amen [Applause]
Hallelujah [Applause] a big reason for all of this that we are
all here today is because of me obeying God and just doing things
God's way when God spoke that word through a prophet I received it as a
true word of God instead of being skeptical and critical because I knew it was God speaking and
then when God led me to be under him as a spiritual daughter that I
would say yes because that was God's plan that was God's will it wasn't random it wasn't like that's not how it works in terms of
having a spiritual father a mother it's not like you who who's my favorite you
know it's like God leads you amen and so that I was obedient in that
and then just humbled myself continually to so I could learn and be equipped and
not come with all old baggage old religious baggage but empty myself out
and allow God to teach me new things and through my spiritual father
and and just continue to humble myself as a spiritual daughter as well so that
God couldn't trust me with the anointing this is a big reason why God has this
system of releasing the anointing like we see from Elijah to Elisha like we see from Moses to Joshua like we
see from Paul to Timothy that system of of coming under where the
anointing is Flowing where God's leading you and serving there being humble there and being equipped there and the
anointing then flows down to you there a big reason why that's God's system is
because it's a big way he's able to Humble us
that that we I mean he tests our humility if we will be humble under and serve
another person if we can learn through another person
that's how a big way that God tests our humility and actually molds The Humble
heart we can't do it our own way
we cry out in our room Lord humble me you you pray for God to Humble you hell
this is how humble you 'll ask you to go serve another
to submit there there be humble there learn there
have a servant heart there you know this is God's way and so that's my testimony
and Hallelujah [Applause]
but um you know Jesus he came in this new way he was a
carpenter I mean his father was a carpenter too and he came from Nazareth
which was looked down upon nothing good comes from Nazareth they say
and he wasn't the expected Messiah he wasn't the expected anointed one he
didn't look the part he didn't come his home his hometown
didn't come from where people expected the anointed one to come from the
Messiah to come from and that was a big reason why he was hated he was rejected
that's a big reason why the Pharisees thought he was from the devil and a
false prophet and would say even he's using demonic powers to cast out demons
a pure lie just made up the a big reason why they were doing
this is because Jesus was so unexpected and different and new and and strange
and weird looking to them right and so it's the same way today and
God will come in the same way today he uses the weak and foolish things to confound the wisdom of this world he
will make us be from places like Nazareth where people reject us because
this is just how God moves and it's for our good it's part of humbling us for us to be rejected by a lot of people
I mean this is still God how this is still how God moves today and so I see that from my life I see that from my
life I see that you know for me personally of course but also like my background I didn't go to Bible School
um I wanted to be a Christian singer songwriter and an actress before that
before God called me and so when people see that background they don't automatically think oh that makes sense
you know there's a lot of weak and foolish things
you know that people could reject me because of my past and and how I look and where I'm from my background
but then also my spiritual father my spiritual father he is from East Africa
he's from Tanzania he has a completely different culture it's a completely different culture in
their Church their way of doing things their way of honoring their way of taking offering of giving offering
um so many different aspects are a different culture not unbiblical but a different culture
but you know just as in the times of Jesus when things looked weird and different
with Jesus when people see different cultures different ways of doing things many
times they just call automatically unbiblical they automatically think it's wrong it's bad it's weird it's unbiblical
and the devil loves to use that I mean he loves to use that skepticism in people to be like the Pharisees and you
know make a huge narrative and bring false narratives and ought what have you so anyways all that being said because
of my spiritual father uh him being from a different culture and and and people
also not understanding so much in the Church of in the body of Christ today about
um the principle of receiving impartation of spiritual fathers and spiritual mothers certain principles
that are important in the Kingdom such as honor amen
honoring those who who should who are worthy of honor as the Bible says
so many the body of Christ today don't even know about that scripture or they haven't read that scripture so because
of all of that um sometimes people reject me because of
my spiritual father just because he's from a different culture and they don't understand and there's other narratives and what have
you sometimes people reject me simply because of that since it's simply because of who my
spiritual father is and so I've seen the devil come in a way um so like sneakily and I've never gave
into it I was never tempted but he came in a way of Temptation he came in a way to suggest to try to
tempt me to not talk about my spiritual father to
leave my spiritual father oh so many ways he's coming this way
through other people speaking this to me but also even just
the the amount of people and and how the rejection has come how dramas drama has come simply because
my spiritual father and so there's that Temptation suggestion from the devil that if you
were to leave or if you to never talk about then everyone would accept you and
no one would have any problem and it'd be easier and all this
I never fell for that at all because I love my spiritual father so much
Hallelujah I love my spiritual father so much and I
could never leave him I mean he he should get so much credit of I mean like
honor Jesus gets all the glory he gets all the glory but in terms of
like how my character has been shaped how I have been equipped
um how I can see in the spiritual realm the anointing moving in me uh prophetic
Direction God has used him mightily day after day week after week
year after year in my life so he deserves honor amen
Hallelujah and so
I it was never a temptation to me but I could just see that that was what the devil was trying to do because he knows
this important principle he knows this was all God's principle of releasing the anointing upon my life of releasing the
anointing here and spreading across the whole world so if I were to do a cut off
for example or not testify not test not give the full testimony the anointing
would dry up it would we have to do things God's way
and it's very serious business we can't play around that's why the anointing is so rare you
you can't play around with God he means serious business you have to take it very seriously you have to have the fear
of God every day amen you play around bye bye the anointing
yeah so sharing my testimony is uncomfortable
it's not completely comfortable to do that because I know that just when I share my testimony it automatically
means that people reject me I know it automatically means someone will make a video clip perhaps of what I've spoke
and try to cut it up and make this weird exposed video or something I know this
every time I testify I know this and so that's not comfortable
but I do it anyway amen
Hallelujah I want to maintain what I received I want to maintain the freedom and the
anointing that I've received and I want to see it grow I want to see God's will be done I want
to see the purpose of my life completely fulfilled I want to see this anointing touch the
whole world so I'll continue to testify unashamingly I'm not ashamed of my Jesus I'm not
ashamed of the Holy Spirit I'm not ashamed of my holy spirit that moves in power and makes demons tremble
and be cast out I'm not ashamed of my Holy Spirit who moves the spiritual fathers and spiritual mothers I'm not
ashamed of my Holy Spirit who moves through vessels through my spiritual father to equip me and to impart this
anointing into me I'm not ashamed of my Holy Spirit I'm not of ashamed of my Holy Spirit who
speaks through prophets today the real word of God
I'm not ashamed of my Holy Spirit and I'm not ashamed to do anything that my holy spirit says to do to honor my
spiritual father I'm not ashamed I'm not ashamed to do is what Paul says and he says I came became like the people so
the people would be would receive me for Jesus they would receive my message I'm not ashamed to go to another culture
where my spiritual father is from and and kneel down and lay a seat at the feet because in that culture that means
that's how you honor a servant of God it has it nothing to do with worship it's
honoring is kneeling down and placing a seed and saying I understand that it is the anoint you
it is your obedience that this anointing has flowed through you and touched my life and so I honor you and I sow a seed
here upon your feet that you're the leader of this ministry and this is this is their culture this
is what they do I'm not ashamed to do that amen I'm not ashamed I'm not
ashamed Hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God thank
you all I bless you all thank you so much that touched me so much to have your your support all of you standing up
and everything thank you so much [Applause] hallelujah
hallelujah thank you thank you so much I'm so I'm so blessed thank you Jesus
thank you Jesus and I also it's so important for me to share my testimony because I know this
is God's way of releasing his anointing there are
some other minor cases we see in the Bible of where God just appears in a
burning bush to Moses and he starts putting the anointing through him without another vessel
same with Elijah there are some cases where God just puts the anointing
without another vessel so God can do that today absolutely but it's not the main way that he
releases the anointing his main way of releasing impartation of anointing
so that others may walk in the power of God is directing his people to be
planted under a spiritual father a spiritual mother and that anointing flowing through them
and in being imparted to them as it says in Psalms
that it speaks of the it is like the oil that comes down Aaron's robe Aaron's
beard and his robe so that's the principle of receiving anointing that you would come under you
would serve under you would come and be planted under where that God has released that anointing God releases
anointing to a servant of God like Elijah like a like Moses like Apostle Paul and that you would come you would
serve there and you would be planted there that would be your covering and the same anointing that's at the head
would be released and touch all of you underneath that's the principle of
receiving anointing and so I know the weight of sharing my
testimony too if I don't share my testimony then you all and all you
watching across the world won't won't be able to receive the anointing
you won't know how to if I said yes God anointed me
but not sharing how he anointed me how it happened
what I did what I did to receive it God's following God's principles and his
ways and his order you will not know and you will not receive
so just like how we read in the Bible today I mean Paul he speaks he speaks in
his word you have many teachers but you only have one spiritual father I became your
spiritual father that's what it says in the word I bet I better read this so you know because some people say that we shouldn't have spiritual fathers but
Paul says I became your spiritual father so it's right there in the word of God Amen
there it is um First Corinthians 4 14.
I am not writing these things to shame you but to warn you as my beloved children for even if you had 10 000 teachers to teach you about Christ you
only have one spiritual Father for I became your father in Christ Jesus when I preach the good news to you so I urge
you to imitate me that's why I sent Timothy my beloved and faithful child in
the Lord he will remind you of how I follow Christ Jesus just as I teach in
all the churches Wherever I Go so because Hallelujah so because Paul
spoke this aloud preached this aloud and it was written in the word of God now
today we get to know this is how we can receive anointing too this is how we can be equipped
spiritual fathers spiritual mothers are important they're a big part of how we are transformed into the image of God to
imitate them as Paul says you know so in the same way for me to
share my testimony it's a living Bible today you know like if as I'm sharing with you this is how I receive the
anointing it's giving you instruction of for how you to receive the anointing
otherwise if I didn't share my testimony with you you'd just be going in your room and just fasting and praying and
crying out to God for the anointing and nothing would happen but would I share you these principles
the importance of of of coming under and and being submitted there
of having a servant heart there of of not going here there everywhere but
being planted when I share with you the importance of serving having a servant heart there and
and helping with the work of God that's taking place there at the church under where God has called you to when I share
with you the importance of Honor when I share with you the importance of impartation as I share these things with you now you
have learned now you know how to position yourself what you need to do so you can receive anointing my heart is
for you to receive what I have received so you can walk in the anointing too and
cast demons out of your children who have autism or whatever it is amen
[Applause] so this is why it's very important I
share my testimony so I just wanted to share with you we all have uncomfortable parts of our testimony where it's it's
it's not easy where it's uncomfortable but you must do it anyways if you want
to maintain what you have received you cannot be ashamed
of any part of your testimony your testimony includes how it looks like the manifestations
this is why we share videos because this is for the glory of God the
testimonies released or how people are saved and brought to Jesus this is why God has commanded me I must be posting
all the videos all the Deliverance don't withhold any of them so God can get the
most glory and so the most amount of people can be led to him and receive Deliverance
[Applause] God moves upon every Deliverance
differently every testimony is different there's people that need your testimony there's people that needs to see God
touch you and then to see the video of you being touched by God there's people that need that to be
saved I mean there's so many testimonies all the time where I hear someone say God's
power moved through the screen during that video and delivered me what if that's your video
but you you say take the video down I'm embarrassed
and now someone's not freed this is serious
to be bold and share our testimony every part of it the video and us sharing how
we are different what God did what we were like before and after
amen people need to hear it people need to
see it people need to witness it you want to imagine the amount of comments and the amount of emails that I get
every single day of saying of different people saying God deliver me through this video God touched me through this
video through this video of the Deliverance happening through this video of someone testifying
I just heard I was just even I can't get I can't escape hearing these testimonies
of how what God has done here the videos have touched people I think it was you sir I was walking
down the stairs and I overheard you saying I think it's a Westin I saw your video and it touched me it changed me
and it's changed a lot of people and I I can't escape it right that happened
yeah hahaha [Applause]
hallelujah hallelujah and
we also need to trust God like my my part of my Testament I know
sharing my testimony it doesn't it makes the devil mad so it means that there he will bring people to
reject me and and do and bring attacks that hurt because directly I shared my
testimony I but I also know that I can trust God
that those weapons formed against me won't prosper Maybe
maybe things will be uncomfortable but it is worth it
for to be in God's Will and the reward that will come and the all of the
benefits for the kingdom that will come because the testimony was shared and because I can maintain what I have
received God will be faithful to protect
and I share this because um I know that some people they have fears they have worries they have fears
about sharing their testimony they have fears they have worries about sharing their Deliverance moment maybe things
they've renounced or something they're they the devil will suddenly come in their ear and and try to bring fear like
what if this person sees this what if this person sees this the devil can even say oh legally maybe this isn't good
someone will come after you legally because you renounce this or something like that but
you need to trust God you need God isn't like oh we better not
share this Wonder of mine
it's the opposite when you testify that's what protects you you try to protect yourself physically but you lose
the protection spiritually demons come back
you try to protect yourself from you think oh maybe a legal thing would happen or this person could come and get
mad at me physical things you're trying to protect yourself from when you do that and you stop the testimony of Jesus
you open the door for demons to come back in because they overcame him by the blood
of the lamb and the word of their testimony so you're not overcoming and so you need to trust God that he
will protect you in every way spiritually and physically he will protect you
for you to come here for you to renounce for you to say I don't want this in my
life anymore I renounce this I renounce this I renounce this you are doing nothing wrong
you are doing everything right in the spiritual realm you're doing everything right and God is the God of
Justice so he has to stand beside you from spiritual to physical amen
and you need to see this as it's beautiful and good what you were doing when you're coming to receive Deliverance when you're coming to
renounce it is God's will for you to do this so you then have God's protection over you
because you are doing what he has called you to do you obey him amen so yes sure there were people that
there will be people that don't understand they don't understand Deliverance so they think you're very strange and weird
it's gonna happen but this is
persecution this is part of it this is the lifting you testify
there's a test whenever you testify there's a test
yeah that's why it's been you some of you have testified and then you find a
tax come it's because your testimony is tested
will you stand firm in your testimony and keep testimony testifying and keep testifying more
this is one of the big areas that God is testing you to see if he can entrust you with more anointing
is if you will testify you want to be casting out demons
Healing The Sick preaching but you're not testifying don't count on any anointing coming upon your life
you need to use what you've been given use what you've been given
the the Bible says when God sees you he can trust you with little he he knows then he can trust you with more so when
you're faithful little he will then give you more you have to be faithful with your testimony
amen Hallelujah and I want to just share you know don't withhold in your testimony
don't withhold the details as I shared before I could leave out details of my testimony
I could choose to not talk about the parts that might have risk if I share
so you need to make sure that you're not withholding um the the scripture we read about the
Samaritan woman she says she told everybody about Jesus all that happened
she told them the whole story and then she said go see him
this lady could have just said wow I just had a miraculous experience
that changed my life God's real you should believe in God everybody
the in the times of the Pharisees people that came to see Jesus and they
got delivered they were Pharisees all around there were many Pharisees all around the town and they come and they testify and they
if they they could have just said God is real he delivered me
and that's it no Pharisee will bother them
but if they say Jesus delivered me I went to where he was ministering I positioned myself where that anointing
was flowing from Jesus and that's how I got delivered they're gonna they're gonna make the
Pharisees mad the Pharisees might try to do things against them but they will be protected
and now tons of people that hear this testimony will be like those people with a Samaritan woman and will then come to
Jesus the deliverer they will position themselves to receive the anointing so you need to not
withhold your testimony and the devil's watching the devil is looking for a loophole to
come back in any way don't be ashamed of Jesus is a deliverer don't be ashamed of Jesus the deliverer
who moves at fivefold church
Hallelujah [Applause] like if you've receive Deliverance here
make sure you you're sharing where you receive Deliverance how it happens
so that others can know where to receive Deliverance where to find Jesus the deliverer
Jesus who moves in power you need to tell them where you found Jesus the deliverer Jesus the Healer Jesus that
moved in power Jesus the one who releases anointing upon your life how it happened
Hallelujah so it's important how you share your testimony amen
amen hallelujah Hallelujah
so that was testimony you're all excited to share your testimony today
or now are you now excited to share it
um every single Sunday we film testimonies Myra who's actually walking right now towards the front that's
perfect timing thanks holy spirit so she films testimonies every single Sunday right after service so
um come see her after service if you have plans today come plan to do it the next week film your testimony this is a
big part of how you'll maintain your freedom amen and share your testimony
on your social media be unashamed of Jesus share in depth how he's delivered you ride it out film a
video do an updated testimony a year later or if God delivered you of more things make sure you share that make
sure you share all that God has done they delivered me of this and this and this and this shared all make a list
don't leave anything out amen Hallelujah
um share in word wherever you can your friends your family your co-workers share share share share if if people are
having conversations with you they see difference in you tell them what the difference is that they see if someone's
talking about how they have anxiety they have depression and God delivered you from these things
you can tell them do you know that I used to have horrible anxiety and depression too but you know what happened I was set
free of these things and this is how it happened you could be free too this should be part of your life these
types of conversations including your testimony it's your biggest witness amen
and you're continually maintaining your deliverance as you do this if you're feeling a nudge like I haven't shared in
a while you should share update it share on your social media again make a new video share the old video
amen keep on overcoming the Devil by the word of your testimony [Applause]
Hallelujah [Applause]
and I I want to share this last part of now I'm going to shift now that was testimony testifying this last part of
how to maintain your deliverance um is Luke 5 12.
well Jesus was in one of the towns a man came along who was covered with Leprosy when he saw Jesus he fell with his face
to the ground and begged him Lord if you are willing you can make me clean Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man
I am willing he said be clean and immediately the leprosy left him
then Jesus ordered him don't tell anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses
commanded for your cleansing as a testimony to them so Jesus gave this prophetic Direction
he gave this direction to the person who he healed who he set free
and he he said show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices so he says he's basically
saying go to the house of God and give sacrifices
make offering
whenever God does something big for you you should always thank him
and really thank him if someone in your life touches you so much
if someone in your life touches you so much you you say thank you I'm so grateful thank you you speak them you
speak that to them but if someone does something really big for you in your life you probably do more than that amen
it probably involves some sort of sacrifice it probably costs something
you probably buy them something you probably give them a gift
even if it's buying a card you you go the extra mile when somebody does something big for you
that really blessed you tremendously amen you probably have all done that right
the word thank you didn't cut it and so that's how it should be with God
that whenever God does something big for you and deliverance is one of the very biggest things he could ever do for you
you should go beyond thanking him with just your words making a sacrifice touches God and
giving to his kingdom touches God so much because it's one of the big ways that
physically and spiritually his kingdom advances is when we support the work of God number one is why it really is
important to him and also number two we all need money on this Earth for food
for shelter it's something we need and because of that it can easily have a
hold on us and it can easily just take up too much of our hearts
God wants to have all of our hearts where your treasure is that's where your
heart will be also so you're treasuring money because you want you need the food you need the shelter but and you want
this and you want the clothes and you want the house and you want the money and you want them press the per you want to impress the girl whatever it is
that's treasure God wants our treasure he wants our
heart more on him than these things than than even the shelter and the food
he wants all of our heart so we can look to him as our provider
not I need this money to survive or I need this money for the things I want he
wants our whole treasure to be upon him because then our whole heart will be with him
that's why God asked us to give people don't know why God asked us to give
people think preachers are asking people to give because they want money or something
but you need to know spiritually that God asks us to give and why he asked us to give it's about your heart
[Applause] something so powerful happens in the
spiritual realm when you make sacrifice of money to God some people they understand God wants sacrifice but
they'll be sacrificing in other ways God's not asking them to they don't want to sacrifice money so then said they'll
sacrifice food and they'll fast when God's not asking them to fast God sees the issue in your heart with
money God sees you even I'm not even some of you you you you you don't even feel like
you have a love for money I mean you you're not even like Desiring cars and
and big houses nothing like that but God sees you worrying about money
he sees you worrying about it I'm not talking about even every day sees that little hold that money has on
you so I'm saying something spiritual happens when you sacrifice money to God
something spiritual happens where all you were delivered from all these holds
that it has on your heart and if you are someone who loves money and you are Desiring so much after
physical things when you sacrifice to God beyond the
comfort zone you sacrifice offerings to God something spiritual happens where
God molds your heart where you no longer have a desire for any of these things
instead your heart becomes Lord I wanna I want you to have all of my money
so whatever that looks like if you want me to give most of it to your work to the church so be it if you
want me to give a lot to the church a lot to orphans a lot to this certain need a lot to this um this non-profit to
invest in them to help them a lot to people my friends my family that are in need whatever like whatever is Lord I
want you to have your way with my money
that's our hearts so when it comes time when God's like I want you to represent me well you can
get that nice clothing it's good quality it costs more yeah I want you to have that
you get it because God leads you not because you're like it's my money I
want it and I want it for these reasons to look good for myself
but when God has your whole heart in terms of money then he leads you perfectly that
whenever you do buy expensive things or something that maybe it's clothes or even a car it's led by God and it's for
a purpose to give God the glory and to be a light of the world you know
amen so that's I want to share briefly briefly with you the principle of giving
offering of giving money to God I want to share with you why why this is a
principle a general principle this is a command from God that we bring tithe but also that we're generous that we would
give more than just 10 we would be generous amen so this is just a general
principle I'm sharing with you about giving that many people don't know they don't know the spiritual truth behind it
and they've been so tarnished indoctrinated by actual um abuse that they've gone through or seen happen
you know mistreatment of funds and churches and stuff like that by that but also the religious spirit
so it's time you know why God wants you to give so you're able to give properly so that God can bless you so that you
can reap Abundant Life amen and also
you can maintain your deliverance when you give to God
um after God is when God has delivered you you should give him a thank you seed you should see it as a thank you seed
not necessarily I'm sowing because otherwise demons are going to come back no no no I'm saying it should be a thank you seat
thank you Lord for for doing this for me but also whenever you sow you reap
it's a principle when you have been delivered
this anointing this powerful anointing that set you free you need more of this anointing in your
life to help you to to keep the devil wants to come back you need more of the
anointing of protection in your life more of the anointing to how to equip you to open up your spiritual eyes
to discern the devil's tactics yes you've received the teaching and the church but you need more of this
anointing to help you spiritually your eyes open more it to stay in you amen
so you should have this Revelation I got delivered I want to be serious about maintaining my Deliverance I'm going to
so a special thank you seed and I know that as I sow this seed even though it's just a thank you God because you deserve
just a thank you sacrifice and I want to honor this anointing this power of God here this work of God
that's taking place I want to honor this anointing for what God's done for me amen but also I know that there's a ribbian
that's gonna come I know there's a reaping of anointing and it's going to be specific anointing with this seed
specific anointing to help me maintain my Deliverance
amen so once God has freed you you should
give him a thank you seed thanking him for freeing you with that Revelation that more anointing is coming
upon your life that you need to help you stay free and you should continually you
should continually sow seeds to God thanking him for freeing you with this
with a specific seed the intention of I want more of this anointing to help me stay free and walk in this Abundant Life
increase in the anointing amen Hallelujah
hallelujah praise God praise God
[Applause]
I just want to share one more scripture Luke Luke 21 1. as Jesus looked up he saw the rich
putting their gifts in the temple treasury he saw also a poor Widow put in two very small copper coins truly I tell
you he said this poor Widow has put in more than all the others all these people gave their gifts out of their wealth but she out of her poverty put in
all she had to live on this scripture shows us how much it
means to God when we give a lot like when we give where it hurts I mean
when we give uncomfortably when we make a sacrifice these rich people were giving money
but if you have a million dollars and you give one thousand dollars
God doesn't see that as that much he's blessed you with all of that
but that wasn't even a little sacrifice and you're using the rest of the one million dollars on yourself
but then there's this Widow that has just a couple coins and she gives all of it and Jesus is so touched by this
you see in this spiritual realm why God wants us to give generously
it's about the heart so he can have all of that heart amen
Receiving & Maintaining Your Deliverance
