when it comes to Ministry to starting
0:02
your own Ministry this should be a
0:04
prophetic Direction a prophetic word
0:07
from your spiritual leader but when it
0:10
comes to what jobs to get should you
0:12
start this job should you start this
0:15
business um this will be mostly for the
0:19
most part not you know coming as a
0:22
prophetic word from your spiritual
0:24
leader um because when it comes to I
0:28
mean there there's sometimes that maybe
0:30
it will be God's appointed time where a
0:32
prophetic word will come you should go
0:34
in this direction for this business for
0:37
this career that can come sometimes for
0:39
the most part when it comes to
0:42
jobs the Holy Spirit wants you You're
0:44
Made In His Image You're Made In God's
0:46
image and so the Holy Spirit wants you
0:47
to walk in wisdom when it comes to jobs
0:50
when it comes to starting businesses to
0:51
really walk in wisdom rather than like
0:54
needing a prophetic word about it like I
0:58
said there can be times where
1:00
divinely comes with a specific Direction
1:03
go here start this business do this job
1:08
but if that is not coming if that if
1:11
currently you don't have this prophetic
1:13
word that means that God is calling you
1:16
to use wisdom use wisdom to to find the
1:20
job find a job because God wants
1:22
everybody to work um the Bible talks
1:24
about how if we don't work we won't we
1:27
won't eat like this is how we access
1:30
provision from God now of course there's
1:32
certain Seasons where maybe you won't
1:34
for whatever reason maybe you're at
1:36
college you know and you so your your
1:38
parents are being gracious and you you
1:40
don't have a part-time job or something
1:41
like like that's fine you're focusing on
1:43
your studies you know things like this
1:45
there there'll be times where you won't
1:46
work or um but for the most part God's
1:50
calling um all of his people to work
1:52
because he wants you to not he wants you
1:54
to be able to bless others he wants you
1:56
to be be able to contribute to the work
1:57
of God he doesn't want you to be in a
1:59
place of lack he wants you to have
2:01
provision he wants you to have abundance
2:03
and so how he releases this abundance
2:06
for the most part is through your job
2:08
there's another message that I preached
2:10
like maybe a couple months ago where it
2:12
was specifically on wisdom like the
2:15
importance of wisdom like so often
2:17
people are like looking for signs
2:19
looking for a prophetic word looking for
2:21
a dream God should I do this and God
2:24
isn't going to come in this like yes but
2:28
rather it's like this big kind of sign
2:31
or big dream prophetic word but it's
2:35
more that he wants you to walk in wisdom
2:37
and make the
2:39
decision and sometimes there isn't when
2:41
it comes to jobs sometimes there
2:43
honestly isn't like a for the most part
2:45
actually with jobs until maybe later on
2:48
in life it's a certain job that God
2:50
really wants you to have but for a lot
2:53
of people like especially if you're
2:54
younger you go through different jobs
2:57
you know you're on a journey um but but
3:00
for the most part it's not like God's
3:02
like I want you to have this job and
3:04
then I want you to have this job but
3:06
it's that a lot of different jobs are
3:07
okay to have like God can use you in
3:09
this job to touch people there there's
3:12
people that are lost and need him in at
3:15
in this workplace and this work and all
3:17
the workplaces so God can use you in in
3:20
different places
3:23
um that's the big thing that's going to
3:26
happen like when in terms of like why
3:28
God would want you in certain places is
3:31
but is to use you as a vessel amen and
3:34
to provide for you what you need to be
3:36
provided for so sometimes you may be um
3:38
putting your standard too low and not
3:40
looking for a job that is like a higher
3:42
pay for example that maybe you didn't
3:45
think you could get but because God's
3:47
favor is with you and you have faith you
3:49
do apply anyways and then God surprises
3:51
you and you get it and so he wants to to
3:53
to give you more there so maybe this
3:54
like other job that doesn't pay very
3:57
much maybe God doesn't want you there so
3:58
I'm not so so what I'm trying to say is
4:00
like there's a realm of like jobs that
4:03
can
4:04
work that you know so what what I'm
4:08
saying is God wants you to use wisdom
4:10
use wisdom what are the gifts that you
4:12
have what are your passions what is the
4:14
money you need to make to to to cover
4:17
your bills and stuff and sometimes maybe
4:19
you need provision and your giftings and
4:22
passions are only like
4:23
singing well you know that doesn't mean
4:26
I have to look for a singing job you
4:29
know for me I was a I was a waitress I
4:31
was a hostess I was a nanny but when I
4:34
looked for those jobs I was like I like
4:36
interacting with people and even the
4:38
nanny and I liked children so but I
4:41
wasn't like this is what I want to do
4:42
with my life is interacting with people
4:45
in a restaurant or this is what I want
4:46
to do with my life this is a big passion
4:48
of mine um Nanny and children like those
4:51
weren't big passions but it was
4:54
something I knew that I would have more
4:57
passion interacting with people than
4:59
like a like a a desk job for for for
5:02
like for me personally type thing that's
5:04
just an example so so see where you
5:08
would would have some sort of passion
5:10
some sort of passion or maybe some sort
5:12
of gifting and then is it going to
5:14
provide is it going to be enough money
5:17
maybe you'll need to have two part-time
5:18
jobs or something something like that
5:20
that's what I mean by wisdom that's for
5:22
for anybody who's thinking like thinking
5:24
about a job or thinking to pursue
5:25
something and to get a degree in
5:27
something that's it you know you don't
5:30
need to um worry so much did I get a
5:32
sign is this right you need to work you
5:36
need to find a job that's the important
5:38
thing and so as long as it's not
5:40
something demonic then that's fine and I
5:43
and I see a lot of emails sometimes so I
5:45
really want to address that to not think
5:47
I need I need this word from God do I
5:50
apply for this job is you know um for
5:53
the most part it's it's just walking in
5:56
wisdom and then in terms of business the
5:59
direction I will give with this is some
6:00
people they have a really exciting dream
6:02
of a business and they're really not
6:05
content at the job they're at but most
6:08
of us especially like when we start out
6:10
like ear in my 20s and early 30s when I
6:13
was working I was a Hostess waitress
6:15
nanny I was not excited to go to work
6:18
each day you know I was I wasn't
6:19
miserable but I was not excited I I mean
6:23
but you have to work you know but
6:25
there's a lot of people who are not um
6:28
happy at their jobs and they have a
6:31
great business idea and many people they
6:33
want to just like stop working and just
6:36
focus on the business but for the most
6:39
part you can't do that or else there
6:42
will be no money coming in because for
6:44
income to be coming in for most
6:45
businesses it takes time it takes many
6:48
times takes investment so many times
6:50
it's very important you're working a
6:51
steady job you're saving money to invest
6:54
in a business for example um and the
6:57
business comes like little by little by
7:00
little by little and and and God when it
7:03
comes to like lifting you and abundance
7:05
coming and provision go he go step by
7:08
step you know and so um it's so
7:11
important to not think like that you'll
7:13
be an
7:14
overnight overnight tons of success with
7:17
a business that you start you know uh so
7:20
that's the wisdom I'll give there if you
7:22
have a business idea that's amazing like
7:24
if you can start it that's great just
7:27
make sure you are um
7:30
doing it with wisdom you know like that
7:32
you're not like quitting a job and then
7:35
you have no money coming in and you're
7:36
just like banking on you you know your
7:39
your sometimes we can like oh God's
7:41
going to provide
7:43
but we're not using wisdom where you you
7:46
we're using it's like an immature kind
7:48
of faith if that if that makes sense you
7:50
know like we have to understand God
7:52
moves in steps we have to make sure
7:54
we're not just like going after our own
7:57
desires and putting it on God I want to
7:59
do this I don't want to do this so I'm
8:01
just going to believe God's going to
8:02
provide like that's that's being like
8:05
little manipulative you know of God so
8:07
that's why I say um the wisdom is the
8:09
the important part amen but I bless all
8:13
of you who are you know going at with
8:16
business ventures starting businesses
8:18
those of you that are looking for new
8:20
jobs you know applying for schools to be
8:22
trained up in something I bless that I
8:25
bless that as you as this is walking in
8:27
wisdom with God I bless it I don't want
8:29
any of you to feel like is this right is
8:31
this wrong as I say most of the time
8:33
it's not like there's a right or wrong
8:35
path with jobs a lot of the time it's
8:38
important that you're walking in wisdom
8:40
amen and God will bless it God will
8:41
bless the work of your hands and if
8:43
there does need to be uh if God does
8:45
specifically want you at a specific
8:47
place he will make it clear so in the
8:49
meantime it's walking in wisdom and
8:51
making Godly decisions decisions as you
8:54
were made in the image of God
