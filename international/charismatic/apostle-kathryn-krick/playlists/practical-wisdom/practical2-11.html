it's the kindness of God that leads to
0:01
repentance and the fear of God comes
0:05
once someone's introduced to God and
0:07
encounter his love I remember when I was
0:09
baptized in the Holy Spirit it was just
0:10
the love of God it was just love love
0:13
love love love that was my encounter
0:15
with God God wasn't like you're not
0:17
fully surrendered do you know that
0:19
you'll go to hell if you stay this way
0:21
that wasn't my encounter my encounter
0:23
was just love and I fell in love with
0:26
Jesus and then as soon as I fell in love
0:28
with Jesus I saw his love the fear of
0:30
God came naturally I was like your love
0:33
is so amazing and you're so Majestic and
0:35
you're so mighty and you're so beautiful
0:37
and big who am I I'm tiny little
0:39
creation conviction Came Upon me like
0:42
who am I to think I know what's best for
0:43
my life the fear of God Just Came Upon
0:46
me after I encountered his love we need
0:48
to present Jesus to people the same way
0:51
that he's presenting himself to us
0:53
because that's how people will really be
0:55
saved and sometimes it's slow you know
0:58
the Bible talks about some plant seeds
1:00
God Waters some people bring in the
1:01
Harvest so often people want to do
1:04
things fast they're on a mission let's
1:06
see how many people I can get saved it's
1:09
not about a repeat after me prayer it's
1:11
about the change of heart and true
1:13
surrender and that generally happens
1:15
over time seeds planted God watering
1:19
eventually Harvest a big way of this
1:21
wrong forcefulness way is rushing God's
1:24
timing and it's like pushing people away
1:26
instead of being a true seed that could
1:29
grow in some way one so really our job
1:31
is to present God in love and gentleness
1:35
with the fruits of the Holy Spirit
1:37
self-control kindness the kindness of
1:39
God leads to repentance so when we're on
1:42
a mission to evangelize let us be kind
1:45
let us be the light let us shine let us
1:49
attract people to Jesus not push people
1:52
away let people want to know more about
1:54
God let people want to come to church
1:56
with us so when you go with that
1:59
intention
2:00
holy spirit will lead you perfectly
