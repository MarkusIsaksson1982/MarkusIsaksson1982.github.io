when you follow God's principles like be
0:02
surrendered be planted be a true
0:05
disciple who always shows up for the
0:08
word of God for a church and applies the
0:11
word and values and follows the Rama
0:14
word that God is speaking when you do
0:16
these things simply every door is shut
0:17
to the devil but when doors have been
0:19
opened it can bring about unnecessary
0:23
attacks from the enemy but you overcome
0:25
them you repent you surrender to God you
0:28
renounce and God God will make the devil
0:32
to flee so there there is such thing as
0:35
as attacks coming from the devil that
0:37
didn't need to come but they came
0:39
because of open doors but then if you
0:41
are keeping doors shut to the devil and
0:43
you're following God's principles you're
0:44
surrendered you are truly planted you
0:46
are truly being humble childlike have a
0:49
pure heart are really being a true
0:51
disciple that means you have no doors
0:53
open to the devil and your and in your
0:55
own life you're not opening up other
0:56
doors so now there can still be attacks
0:58
that the devil will bring but those are
1:00
the attacks that God allows and those
1:03
are attacks are exciting whenever God
1:05
allows attacks it's to push you higher
1:07
it's to elevate you it's to bring
1:09
refining and make you more like Jesus
1:12
number one and number two is to promote
1:14
you when every door is kept shut and
1:16
you're surrendered and and God allows
1:18
attacks to come it's exciting it
1:20
literally means you're becoming more
1:22
like Jesus because you're being refined
1:24
and it means you're going higher it
1:25
means God's lifting you it means reward
1:28
is coming
