**The Secret of the Anointing: Accessing the Power of God to Walk in Miracles**

“Apostle Kathryn Krick has written a powerful book that teaches believers about anointing. Spiritual snipers will be armed and dangerous against the enemy of our souls for the Kingdom of Jesus Christ to destroy the works of darkness. This amazing book will truly bless brothers and sisters around the world.”
—**Evangelist John Ramirez, John Ramirez Ministries**

“When you read *The Secret of the Anointing*, you'll be infused with revelation on what the power of the anointing is, the way in which it is received and how God desires to use us as Kingdom movers, shakers and breakers in the Spirit. Prepare to dispel darkness and glorify Jesus Christ. You won't regret reading this book!”
—**Apostle Charlie Shamp, Destiny Encounters International, author of *Angels, Transfigured, Altars* and *Mystical Prayer***

“*The Secret of the Anointing* is a game changer. This book will open your eyes to exactly what God has placed inside each one of us to flow in another realm of anointing! Everybody needs this book in their library.”
—**Kim Jones “Real Talk Kim,” pastor of Limitless Church, Atlanta**

“I absolutely love Kathryn Krick. This book is so necessary right now; people are hungry for revival and to see a move of God. Her testimony speaks to the power of God. I love the honesty, humility and authority she carries. This book is a tool for believers to understand what God has done and what He desires to do through us. I can’t wait for the world to be blessed by this literary work.”
—**Erica Campbell, Grammy-nominated singer and songwriter**

“Kathryn Kuhlman once said that anyone who was willing to pay the price could have the same anointing she had. Decades later, we see how God has raised up another Kathryn sharing a similar message. Kathryn is a pure-hearted lover of Jesus, and many have encountered freedom and deliverance through her ministry. She has overcome setbacks, challenges and criticisms, and has been vigilant to keep her eyes upon Jesus. I pray that as you read *The Secret of the Anointing* you will receive fresh impartation to live as a consecrated lover of Jesus.”
—**Jennifer Miskov, Ph.D., founding director of School of Revival, author of *Fasting for Fire, Ignite Azusa, Walking on Water* and others**

“*The Secret of the Anointing* is timely. It is troubling to see many in the church and in leadership reject the anointing of the Holy Spirit when in the Bible the criteria for ministry includes anointing. To be anointed means to be supernaturally empowered to do the impossible! Nothing in ministry is possible without the anointing. Apostle Kathryn brings a restoration of this important revelation of the anointing to the Church. She defines what the anointing is, the cost of the anointing and how to release and maintain it. This powerful book will transform and change your life so you can start moving in the supernatural power of God with miracles, signs and wonders. I highly recommend this book!”
—**Apostle Guillermo Maldonado, King Jesus International Ministry**

### **FOREWORD**

I have studied several figures throughout history for much of my ministry life. What does it take to carry the power and presence of God’s anointing? Why did certain people emerge in the time they did to bring Christianity forward? How does one become qualified for this? These questions have driven me on a quest for a lot of my Christian life.

The journey and pursuit has also led me to believe that, in my lifetime, multitudes of Christians are being appointed and are going to rise up to deal with some of the most pressing issues of our generation, but with the power of God. The options we have on the table of humanity to deal with social justice, racial issues, climate and environmental issues, political and economic issues of the times are beginning to show they are not enough. We need God options—options that only those who walk in intimacy with and empowerment from God can bring. I am believing that God is igniting believers all over the world to walk in His same anointing to not only deal with the massive oppressions of the demonic, but also to usher in the Kingdom activity that Jesus’ great grace and the cross is worthy of.

The beautiful thing about God’s secrets when it comes to moving in authority, and especially when it comes to moving in His power and anointing, is that they are all revealed through Christ, and this gained knowledge is transferable. Each person who desires in their heart can receive important subjects. God made believers to receive from one another. He made our faith to see healings, deliverance and visitation, and revival come by hearing (see Romans 10:17).

In light of this truth, I went to see Kathryn in the park where she was holding services because I had heard some amazing reports about what God was doing and was just wanting to see what God was doing. Los Angeles was in total lockdown, and my wife and I were trying to navigate the politics of mask wearing in a year of fear and public confusion. We were facing a sickness that we didn’t have a lot of information about, so I was excited to hear about a ministry that was wide open in the park while many of our friends in the city had shut down their churches and meetings. Los Angeles is one of the most cautious places on Earth, which was in a big and hard lockdown storm, and I didn’t know of any other church that was choosing to pursue the presence of God in its meetings in Hollywood or central LA at that time. I had to see it for myself.

The service hadn’t started yet, and Kathryn was helping her team with a refreshingly reproducible setup for those who were coming from what seemed to be some very hard places. When she started preaching, the day turned into an earth connection both in message and to the people who attended that was very special. As I watched people manifest demons and Kathryn effortlessly help them into freedom through the anointing, I knew I was witnessing something that I have been praying for. God had raised Kathryn up, and she was helping to raise up others. I say it was something special because I could hear in Kathryn’s own message—whether online or in her meetings—that her drive is to raise up the average Christian who really wants to walk with God into the same kind of gifts, anointing and authority. She wasn’t trying to be the only one, and there was no ego in the meeting. She was simply gracefully moving in her gifting and office, imparting freedom to others and dealing with principalities, so others could move in the anointing and walk in revival now.

I was so excited to see this. With all the years that I have gone out of personal hunger to investigate the miraculous and those who walk in prophecies and power gifts, I knew this was legitimate. Kathryn had the mark of a true apostolic purity, which is to raise up others in the anointing. When she teaches, she makes it all seem so simple, like any of us can walk in the anointing. And she couldn’t be more right!

As I write this foreword, I have to say that this book is so insightful and powerful. It digs deep into that voice in my spirit that just wants more of God and to walk in His mind and reality while here on Earth. If you picked up this book, it’s because you are hungry and want to grow. For that same reason, Kathryn has laid out a very practical guide that is easy to follow and biblically based.

If you promise to God to walk in His anointing, there will always be some stigma, whether that is controversy with other Christian groups, judgments from other leaders, gossip and chatter from people at work or in your career or family misunderstandings. There is a price, and that price sometimes gets amplified the more God’s anointing increases on you. But I want to encourage you that no other relationship or life pursuit offers such a fulfillment as walking with the Spirit of God, in His power to birth His purposes in human hearts and set people free. There isn’t a drug that can make you feel this good, there isn’t an earthly relational connection that can make you feel so loved. This is a unique experience that God designed all of us for, but few will actually attain it because the price is so high. Kathryn is paying that price, and because of it, she is seeing the powerful presence of God do things that are rare and miraculous. This could be your story, too.

Read the whole book, take notes, ask the Holy Spirit what He is requiring of you. However, you like with the anointing, picture yourself moving in deliverance and miracle power, envision yourself taking people to freedom and releasing powerful words from God, and then ask God to make you the person it will take to carry that anointing. He wants to give you more than His love and His salvation. He wants to raise you up and use your life to bring Jesus His full reward!

### **INTRODUCTION**

**Revival Broke Out**

I was on my way to “Revival in the Park” on a Sunday morning in mid-March 2021. My car was full of all our outdoor church equipment. I was about to set up for Sunday service with our team of two—Jeanntal, our worship leader (now my assistant and best friend), plus me. I was sitting in the car, talking to God, so full of expectancy that He would move in power like never before. There were four people who had informed me that they were traveling across the country, two from Nashville and two from Massachusetts, to come to Five-Fold Church (or 5F Church, as we call it) for our service in the park.

I had been the pastor/apostle of 5F Church for about four years at that point. Our congregation had gone from twenty people in 2017, to fifteen people in 2018, to ten people in 2019, to sometimes just two people in 2020 (Jeanntal and me in the park), when we took services outside because we could no longer rent our building due to Covid. I had been believing in a promise from God, a prophecy spoken to me more than four years prior, that He would do many miracles through me and that I was called to reach the nations as an apostle of Jesus Christ. At 5F Church we had also been believing in a prophecy released to us in 2017 that Revival Is Now for America, and that it would begin in Los Angeles and spread across the United States and the world.

But for three years I didn’t see many miracles happen at our church (at least, I didn’t see what I imagined revival to look like), and our church decreased in numbers each year. Yet I never stopped believing in the promises of God and declaring that Revival Is Now. I didn’t have much of a following on social media up to this point, either (around a thousand Instagram followers, a few hundred YouTube subscribers and a few thousand TikTok followers).

On December 30, 2020, I created and posted a one-minute video on TikTok showing God moving in power the previous year at 5F Church. In 2020, I had seen Him heal Tanzanian children who had HIV, and heal others who had leg pain. I saw His power touch people so mightily that they fell back. I put these miracles in the video and prayed for the viewers at the end of it. A couple of days later, on January 1, 2021—my thirtieth birthday—the video reached one million views. I was completely shocked! Talk about a birthday surprise!

And then I read the comments. There were thousands of comments, each one testifying of miracles people had received while they watched the video. Healings, deliverances, people feeling the power of God, even atheists testifying that they felt power as they watched the video. I had only seen one person testify of receiving a miracle through any of my videos online before this, and that was two months prior. Now there were thousands testifying after just a one-minute video?

That video, and some additional videos I made, started circulating and going viral, and they reached these people in Massachusetts and Nashville. On that Sunday in mid-March 2021, these four flew in to come to “Revival in the Park.” Although online there were thousands viewing my livestreams, our park revival services were still small. They had increased from five people the first week in January 2021 to about twenty-five to thirty by mid-March.

I couldn't believe four people were flying across the country to come to our church service in the park, and there were fewer than thirty of us there!

I was on my way to church that day full of expectation because I knew this principle in the Kingdom of God: When people are hungry and sacrifice for God (for example, by traveling across the country), God shows up. He satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things (see Psalm 107:9). I had expectancy that this would be the most powerful service we had ever had, and that we would see God move extraordinarily. But I had no idea what God was actually about to do and how this one Sunday would change the course of my entire life. It would be the day that the walls of Jericho would come down and the promise I had been waiting on and meditating on just about daily for four and a half years would finally come to pass!

I showed up to the park’s amphitheater and found sixty people from some sort of social event gathered in our spot. We couldn’t reserve it at the time because of Covid; it was just first come, first served. Although their event was wrapping up, they didn’t want to move. We had never had the amphitheater taken before. On this day of all days! It was a spiritual battle to have church. I pleaded with the group, and finally they moved to the side of the amphitheater. But they still continued to blast heavy metal music and socialize just six feet from where I was preaching.

I told those who had traveled cross-country to be there to come up to the front row and I would preach loudly over the heavy metal music. I became even more expectant because I knew the devil was trying harder than ever to stop these hungry children of God from receiving. After the message, I started praying for one of the girls from Massachusetts.

She told me, “What made me come was that when I watched one of your videos, I saw Jesus in your eyes.”

I started praying for this woman, and without me touching her, she fell back with the power of God. I had seen God move in that way as I had ministered before, but then I started noticing something different. Instead of lying peacefully on the ground, her body was trembling and convulsing. I immediately discerned that this was a demon trembling in her.

I had never seen this when I ministered before. I had seen other ministers cast out demons, but I had never seen demons tremble in my ministry!

The Holy Spirit led me to address the demon sternly, with authority, and command it to leave her. When I did, the demon spoke through her mouth: “I don’t want her to preach” (meaning this woman the demon was speaking out of). I commanded the demon to then stand up. The girl stood up—or the demon possessing her body stood her up, forced to obey the command because Jesus has given us authority over demons. I then commanded it to leave her. As soon as I said the words, the demon left, and the force of the demon leaving her body made her fall down, as if someone had pushed her hard. Her head fell perfectly onto one congregant’s foot, and she was immediately asleep. It was just like in Luke 4:35-36:

“Be quiet!” Jesus said sternly. “Come out of him!” Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.

All the people were amazed and said to each other, “What words these are! With authority and power he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out!”

This was the first time I saw the anointing in me make demons tremble and be cast out. From there, it was as if the floodgates opened. Every single Sunday since that day, demons have trembled and been cast out of multitudes of people. The video of the first demon being cast out went viral, and within a couple of weeks, people were flying in from different states to encounter God and be set free at 5F Church’s “Revival in the Park” services.

From that Sunday in mid-March to Sunday, May 23, the church grew from twenty-five to seventy people. On May 30, three hundred people came! Since that Sunday, hundreds have come every week, and every single week people have flown in from different states and countries (for example, from Tahiti, Romania, Japan, the United Kingdom, Colombia, Australia, the Dominican Republic, Spain, Turkey, Mexico, Canada, the Netherlands, Malaysia, Singapore and India). Thousands have been delivered in person at 5F Church and also just by watching the services online.

By August 2021, I was traveling every single week to different states to minister at conferences and “Revival Is Now” events, and many people were delivered, healed and received many miracles at every service. In January 2022, I began traveling to different countries to minister (ten nations in 2022), and we saw God move everywhere in His same extraordinary power. Now, people in different time zones wake up in the middle of the night to tune in to our live events and encounter Jesus!

I started out not knowing that Jesus was still using people to cast out demons, heal the sick and do signs and wonders, and not imagining that God would ever use me to do those things. Then I went to believing that God would use me in His power, but never seeing it for years. Then one day, I started seeing the power of God move through me in ways that shocked me daily!

In this book, I am going to share the secrets I have learned about the anointing. It is God’s will for all of His children to walk in His power. It is my assignment from God to share these secrets with you, so that you are able to access the anointing as well. Revival Is Now, and God is ready to use you in power, in ways that will shock you!

“And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.”

Mark 16:17-18

### **Chapter 1** 

**What Is the Anointing?**

> And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.
> **Isaiah 10:27 KJV**

Have you ever wondered why you can’t shake that anxiety, no matter how many times you pray and renew your mind? You've been prayed for so many times, but that sickness still remains. You surround yourself with Spirit-filled people, you only listen to worship music, you read the Bible for hours, but you still experience depression and can’t ever seem to feel joy. You try so hard to break that addiction. You truly don’t want to do drugs, watch porn, sleep around, but it’s as though a force stronger than you is forcing you to do these things. All the while, you feel consumed with guilt and shame, thinking, *It’s just my weakness that makes it so hard for me to change.* The truth is, you need God’s anointing to destroy these “yokes.”

The anointing is the measure of God’s power that He puts in a vessel. This power destroys yokes. Oxen have a yoke on their necks, which is connected to a heavy load of passengers or goods. It is a heavy burden placed upon them, and they are stuck in that yoke until someone releases them from it. In the spiritual realm, yokes are demonic oppression (demons) that bind you. They cannot be removed through your own effort alone, such as getting counseling, taking medicine, praying, fasting or reading the Bible. Only the anointing can destroy these yokes.

**WHERE IS THE ANOINTING FOUND?**

The anointing is found in human vessels. God chooses vessels to put His anointing in. All the yoke-destroying miracles we see throughout the Bible happen through human vessels. The signs and wonders that led to the yoke of slavery being destroyed off the Israelites happened through Moses. It wasn’t God doing miracles from the sky; it was God doing them through Moses.

Elisha’s anointing was so powerful that a dead man came alive when his body touched Elisha’s bones (see 2 Kings 13:20-21). Paul’s anointing was so extraordinary and unusual that when sick or demon-possessed people touched the handkerchiefs that had touched his skin, they would immediately be healed (see Acts 19:11-12). Notice how it was a handkerchief that had specifically touched Paul, an anointed vessel, that destroyed the yokes. Peter also carried a strong anointing where demons were cast out and the sick were healed just by being near his presence and having the touch of his shadow fall on them when he passed by (see Acts 5:14-16). The anointing has a location! It is found in human vessels.

There is a difference between receiving the Holy Spirit at salvation and receiving the anointing. Everyone who believes in Jesus receives the Holy Spirit. But not everyone who has the Holy Spirit receives the anointing. The anointing is the Holy Spirit, but it is a specific measure of the Holy Spirit moving in power through a human vessel.

When you give your life to Jesus, the Holy Spirit comes and lives in you. You can now hear from God and commune with Him. The baptism of the Holy Spirit goes beyond that. It is when the Holy Spirit comes *upon* you the way we see happen in the book of Acts: “But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you” (Acts 1:8; see also Acts 8:14-17; 10:44-47). Now you are activated and ready to walk in the power of God. Yet God has to first trust you before He can give you the measure of His power.

With the baptism of the Holy Spirit, you can speak in tongues, which is communing directly with the Holy Spirit and speaking God’s will, as well as edifying your spirit man (pushing your flesh down and building up your spirit). The baptism of the Holy Spirit also empowers you to live surrendered to God and fills you with fire and passion for Him and His Kingdom.

People can still be prideful, however, even with the baptism of the Holy Spirit. They can be disobedient to God and still pray in tongues. Spirit-filled people can grieve the Holy Spirit and be like the Israelites in the wilderness, wandering forever and dying before they reach the promised land of walking in anointing. Carrying the anointing is something different than just having the Holy Spirit and praying in tongues. There is a cost to the anointing. Anointing comes as God inspects your heart and finds you humble. Anointing comes when God can see that you have a heart like David’s—a heart after His heart, His desires and His will, rather than your own dreams, agenda, status and ego.

Anointing is God’s true power. When misused, it can lead many away from God. When misused, it can do a lot of damage to the Kingdom of God and advance the devil’s kingdom. That is why God is very careful with releasing His anointing. The vessel must be trustworthy. The heart has to be right.

**THE AUTHORITY OF THE ANOINTING**

A yoke is a demonic chain in the spiritual realm. To remove these, you have to have the authority to remove them. You can’t pray any which way. They will not be lifted unless you truly have the authority to lift them.

When the disciples returned from casting out demons for the first time, Jesus said, “I have given you authority over all the power of the enemy” (Luke 10:19 NLT). In other words, Jesus was saying, “Yes, this is why the demons obeyed you. This is why you were able to remove the yokes. Because I have given you authority to remove those demonic yokes. I have given you authority over those demons. They must obey.”

What many people don’t realize is that many sicknesses, disorders and oppression like addiction, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts and night terrors are actually demonic, meaning a demonic spirit is causing these afflictions. People try to pray the afflictions away, saying, *God, take it away! God, heal me!* People take medicine and go through counseling, but the problem still remains. Maybe the problem is numbed or medicated, but deep down it is still there, because the root of the symptom is a demonic spirit.

To get rid of a demonic spirit, you must have authority over that spirit and execute that authority properly. Praying any old way won't do it. You can’t simply pray *God, take it away!* when Jesus told you “I’ve given you authority over the demons; *you* cast them out” (by God’s power in you). To cast out means to take action and authority over the demon.

**HOW SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY WORKS**

Let’s look at how authority works in the spirit realm. You have the choice to give God authority over your life in all situations (meaning you say yes to His will), or to give the enemy authority over your life (meaning you say yes to the devil’s will). “The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly” (John 10:10 NKJV). The way the devil is able to accomplish stealing, killing and destroying in a person’s life is when that person accepts the devil’s will.

When Jesus shed His blood on the cross, and even before going on the cross, He was purchasing complete abundant life for you as your inheritance. By His stripes you are healed (see Acts 26:17-18; Isaiah 53:5). Healing is now your inheritance. In fact, abundant health is now your inheritance. Abundant life means abundance in every area—in your mind, in your body, in your relationships, in your finances.

As Christians, we need to understand that abundant life is our inheritance. We should view lack in our life as something that cannot stay and does not belong to us, because we know what our inheritance is. We should view many sicknesses, oppression, poverty, etc. as lies of the devil. He brings you a lie and tries to get you to believe that it’s the truth. For example, because you feel anxiety and the doctor has diagnosed you as having anxiety, the devil tells you that anxiety is your portion. When you accept this as your portion and reality, in the spiritual realm what you're doing is actually accepting the devil’s will in your life, which is the action of handing over your authority to the devil. Instead, you should take authority over every lie of the devil in your life.

The Bible says to “take every thought captive” to Christ (2 Corinthians 10:5). So when you're feeling anxious, you should identify that anxious thought as a lie from the devil. “Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you” (James 4:7). You can say aloud, “I reject that lie of anxiety/depression/rage/sickness/suicidal thoughts/nightmares.” And then declare Scripture aloud that speaks of God’s will for your life. If you’re feeling anxious, you should speak aloud from the Scriptures, “God did not give me a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a sound mind. I have perfect peace. Jesus has given this to me. It is my inheritance. Fear is not allowed to be in me. Any lie of fear must go” (see 2 Timothy 1:7; Isaiah 26:3). In the spiritual realm, this is the act of taking authority over the devil.

God has given you authority over all the earth (see Genesis 1:26-28). He wants you to walk in authority by bringing His will to this earth. So you are constantly saying, *Thy will be done. King Jesus, I use the authority you’ve given me to bring your will to this earth and in my life.*

As long as you are serious about constantly taking authority over the enemy’s schemes in your life, he must defer to you every time. If you’ve never used the authority God has given you before, it’s time to start. If you take this seriously, you will see drastic transformation in your life immediately. The devil has tried hard to keep this truth hidden from believers. Many in the Body of Christ today have no idea that they actually have authority over the issues the devil has brought on in their lives, and that they can access the full abundant life Jesus gives, if they will just use the authority they’ve been given.

Every believer has been given authority over the devil’s attacks in his or her personal life, and every believer is given a measure of authority over the devil’s work in other people’s lives (depending on his or her calling and heart). Jesus said, “I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you” (Luke 10:19). It was this authority given to the disciples that made the demons leave!

The anointing God puts in a human vessel also contains authority. When demons see your anointing, they also see your authority. They see that the anointing upon you has the authority to destroy yokes. The more anointing/authority, the more demons are cast out, the higher the level of the demons cast out (such as principalities), and the quicker, with less effort, they are cast out. What makes demons leave is first, when they see that anointing/authority is in a vessel; second, when they see that the vessel knows the authority he or she has; and third, when they see that the vessel knows how to use that authority properly.

Many sicknesses actually have a demonic root. Some sicknesses are actually a spirit (demon) of infirmity. Since a demon is at the root of such sicknesses, a vessel with authority must use that authority to command the demon of infirmity to leave. Some months ago, I was in a large city, ministering at a “Revival Is Now” event. During the mass deliverance corporate prayer at the end of service, I spoke out “I command the spirit of infirmity to leave.” A woman who had a chronic illness and who was deaf because of it immediately fell to the ground and testified that as she fell, she felt something leave her. As soon as it left, her ears opened. She was wearing hearing aids, and suddenly everything was too loud because she had regained her hearing and no longer needed them! She has since testified that she hears perfectly now.

Simply saying “I pray that you are healed” to her didn’t work in that case. For that sickness to leave, there needed to be a vessel who carried authority to command the spirit of infirmity to leave. This is a major reason why we see that all sicknesses were healed in the Acts Church, but today we only see some healed, or few. Many in the Body of Christ don’t know that we have to take authority over many afflictions because they actually come from demonic roots, and casting out the demons is what makes the demons, and therefore the afflictions, go.

Jesus told us to cast out demons. That’s a command. That’s an action. He didn’t say, “Pray that the demons will leave; pray that the Father in heaven will make the demons go.” It is Jesus’ power that makes the demons go, but it is our job, which He gave us to do, to take authority over the demons and cast them out.

**DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THE ANOINTING**

There are different levels of the anointing. It is God’s will for every believer to carry the anointing, but the anointing in each believer will look different, according to God’s perfect plan and purposes.

There are also different levels of demonic powers in the spiritual realm: “For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places” (Ephesians 6:12 NKJV). This verse is actually speaking of the different levels. For example, principalities mean “princes” of their spiritual territory. Principalities are the highest level of demonic power. In the same way, in the Kingdom of God there are different levels of anointing. Principalities can only be cast out with high levels of anointing.

This is one reason why a person who is ministering might see some demons cast out of people when he or she prays, while other higher-level demons seem more stubborn about leaving. The spiritual insights I will share with you in this book will help you receive higher levels of anointing to deal with higher-level demons, and you will learn the solutions for seeing every person set free.

The Bible clearly shows us that there are different levels of anointing. Paul was doing “extraordinary” miracles, which shows us that he carried a higher level, a greater anointing than most people: “God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them” (Acts 19:11-12). Also according to this verse, he wasn’t having to spend hours casting out demons; many times he wasn’t even having to say a word to cast them out. The anointing was so strong in him that when a handkerchief that had touched Paul touched a person with demons, the demons had to leave!

We also see a high level of anointing operating in the apostle Peter:

> Nevertheless, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number. As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter’s shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by. Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those tormented by impure spirits, and all of them were healed.
> **Acts 5:14-16**

Wait a second, all of them were healed? Are we hearing any church report in these days we live in that all of the sick and demon oppressed who come to a church are healed? The apostle Peter must have been walking in a higher level of anointing than what we see today, for the most part. If all were healed, that means even the principalities had to leave. There was an ease with Peter as well, in which the demons fled and the sick were healed. Just his shadow touching the people healed them! Like Paul, many times Peter didn’t even have to say a word. People were quickly healed and set free with ease, because of the higher-level anointing.

It is God’s will for this same anointing that the apostles Peter and Paul walked in to be accessed today! Jesus made us this promise: “Anyone who believes in me will do the same works I have done, and even greater works” (John 14:12 NLT). Before He returns, the Bride has to be ready. The Bride has to be blameless, spotless and pure. The Body of Christ has to first look like the Acts Church, and then go from glory to glory and do “even greater works.” Revival Is Now, and God is now pouring out His anointing (even the extraordinary anointing) on His Church. It is God’s will for every believer to walk in His anointing, and it is time now that true believers with pure, humble, childlike hearts receive and walk in it.

We are in a Kingdom of God. Webster defines *kingdom* as “a politically organized community or major territorial unit having a monarchical form of government headed by a king or queen.” In the Kingdom of God, Jesus is King, and He has a government (the Body of Christ) to which He has given authority. We bring God’s will and the ideals of His Kingdom to this earth as we walk in our positions of authority in the Kingdom.

There are different levels of authority/anointing in the Kingdom of God, just as there are different positions and levels of authority in an earthly kingdom. The level of authority/anointing people receive is based on their specific calling and their heart. You must have a trustworthy heart to receive a high level of anointing. Then it is also simply according to God’s plan which level of anointing He wants to distribute for His own purposes. Those in the five-fold ministry operate in the highest level of anointing because they are the ones called to equip and impart to the Body of Christ (see Ephesians 4:11-16). Where you receive from must be greater than what you already have, and you can eventually walk in a higher level of anointing than even those who equip you and impart to you, if that is God’s will. We see this in Elisha’s story, as Elisha received a double portion of anointing from his spiritual father, Elijah.

We are all called to heal the sick and cast out demons, but it will look different depending on your specific calling. The Church is where the higher-level demons are cast out and the higher-level miracles happen, for the most part, because that’s where high levels of anointing are usually carried. People would bring the sick and demon possessed under the apostle Peter’s shadow, who was a leader in the Church, because they knew he carried such a high level of anointing that even the highest-level demons had to obey.

Every believer is called to walk in the anointing, but not everyone may be called to deal with principalities. In the Body of Christ, the correct order for walking in authority and seeing the most effective miracles is this: Each believer is to walk in his or her own domain of authority, and also to bring people under “the apostle Peter’s shadow” of today, so to speak. For example, let’s say you encounter someone throughout your day who is talking about having dark, suicidal thoughts. If the person is open to prayer and has come to you, this is within your domain of authority. Pray for that person. Take authority over those demonic spirits in him or her. Declare that those suicidal thoughts must go!

This is how our Christian life should be. Whenever you encounter the works of the devil in your domain, take authority over them and release the anointing God has given you. It will look different for every believer, but you are truly called to carry God’s power. When you speak or pray, your words will carry power and bring healing and freedom! God wants you to be a vessel of His power so that people can truly meet Him and have a tangible encounter with Him through you.

In modern times, anointing is rare. It can appear as though only a few ministers (in comparison to how many there are in the world) carry this unique anointing to walk in miracles. It was never God’s will for just a couple of people to carry the anointing, however. It is His will for all believers to walk in His power:
