I'm teaching today how to pray the Jesus
way and last Sunday I gave a I I began teaching this so that it's an important
foundation so if you didn't hear last Sunday's message after this service after today make sure you go to our
YouTube channel on five Hill Church or my YouTube channel go under live and you'll find that sermon that service
okay make sure you watch it if you haven't it says in 1 Corinthians 14 15
so what shall I do I will pray with my spirit but I will also pray with my
understanding I will also pray with my
understanding so um last Sunday I began to teach on this
verse giving revelation of this verse and really the meaning of it is to pray
with understanding of God's mind we we are called to have the mind of
Christ but that doesn't come automatically it comes by choosing to
renew your mind to the truth to the new wine Revelation anointed word that has
been released to you that gives you understanding of
God's mind rather than the religious
doctrine that you probably grew up in or have known for so or or or were taught
for a long time so to pray with understanding means
to have the mind of Christ to renew your mind to be in line with the mind of
Christ so part of having the mind of Christ means having understanding of the
spiritual realm having understanding of the kingdom of God like understanding
how the kingdom of God operates in God's
ways rather than just like this basic minimal belief that God
exists and that's it and you just pray however and act as
a Believer however or act in a religious way that you have been
taught the Pharisees were missing so much Revelation about the mind of Christ
the mind of God the kingdom of God the spiritual realm the Mysteries the deeper things of
the spiritual realm God's ways they were missing that Revelation they believed in
God they knew God was real but the way that they were praying the way that they were fasting the way that they were
walking as Believers of God was without
understanding amen so to to to pray with understanding is
to understand first of all God is
good always God's plans are good I have been
given an inheritance from God a coinheritance with Christ and that
inheritance is Abundant Life as a child of of God John 10:10 the devil came to
steal kill and destroy but I have come so that You' have life and have it in abundance so your inheritance as a child
of God is abundant life and that means revelation of that
means by his stripes we are healed healing Freedom deliverance from demonic
strongholds demonic oppression curses generational curses that's in your
inheritance abundance in every area abundance of provision that you will have more than enough
because the kingdom that you are a part of that you are a child of your King has
all the riches in this world so you will not lack because you're a child of the
king and the Devil comes to steal kill and destroy including finances Jesus has
come to destroy those works now you have an inheritance of abundance amen
hallelujah praise God so it's having that understanding that I have been giving this
inheritance healing Freedom Abundant Life and I am a child of the
king and the kingdom is backing me as a
child and I have victory over the devil when I walk as a true child when I am
surrendered when I am obedient to God when I am humble
amen and so God has also said that we are called to walk in Dominion on this
Earth so I we will take authority in
Christ and the the the devil the demons must submit and whatever's come from the
enemy must submit to that Dominion that's the understanding we walk in that
we pray in hallelujah
hallelujah and and we have this understanding that God wants us to be taken care of
Hallelujah we are his beloved Sons and Daughters we have this understanding we
have this understanding that God is omnipotent
omnipresent omnicient so he's all powerful he's all knowing and he's
everywhere we have that understanding you know so when we have
all that understanding our prayers become more simple because we know that it is not
hard to reach God since he's all knowing and all over the place and he lives in
you Hallelujah we know that when we pray he
hears he he knows our mind he knows our prayers before we even pray
them so we don't have to struggle to get him to
here hallelujah so when we pray praying with understanding is praying then in
Simplicity and it's praying with confidence in who you are and who your
God is and confidence in the Kingdom we got a whole Kingdom we got angels in
this Kingdom working on our behalf I mean
confident Sons and Daughters we are called to be hallelujah praise
God so that's what I mean by praying with
understanding but when you're not praying with understanding when you don't have a revelation of all of these
things that I just shared all of these aspects about God and his kingdom
you're you you you start to have religious
Illusions religious Illusions like God God I haven't seen my prayer
answered yet so maybe I need to do religious things to try to get God to hear maybe
he didn't hear maybe he's not responding until I do this and this and this and I
prayed but I haven't seen it come to pass yet so maybe I need to add on fasting for many days to get God to hear
to get God to respond let me try now in force to get
this prayer heard and answered that's actually the action of
the praying religiously like when you're praying to try to like move the heart of
God like thinking that as you repeat the prayers as you add on things like
fasting it's going to get God's
attention God reminded me of something as I was meditating on this on this
message on what I'm sharing now he reminded me of um how acting okay acting
and singing was my biggest passion and right before I became the lead in my
high school musicals for three years well my school had only like 80 people per class so it wasn't like that amazing
but I mean that impressive but um for three years I was the lead in my High
School Musical but two years before I was the lead I was painfully shy so much
so that one time I just said something kind of out loud in the class and a person in front of me turned behind her
and said did you just speak really I I didn't know how to
speak in front of a group of people even like two or three like I could speak comfortably with friends but even if I
was in a group of friends of five or six I would feel nervous like there's a lot of eyes on me and I'm like what is what
I'm going to say going to be like important enough or will they like what I say I don't know that was just kind of
what would go through my head when I would be in front of people so but when I when I when I was a lead in the music
H I had like no fear but that was because a gifting of mine was to to act
to sing and I I could memorize pretty well so like I memorized the script and
so I had it all down pat and so I could go out there and I just
perform you know I it's like I knew I would do well because I put in the work
and I memorized everything and singing was a gift of mine so I had like confidence in it you know I wasn't in
still insecure and acting um and but but then I I I would struggle so much with
public speaking when I was in college I had to present in front of 10 people and I would my brain would just go like like
dead like blank and I think some people relate to this probably and I was like what's
happened I just can't even think about any I don't know what I'm supposed what I'm supposed to speak just in front of 10 people not just one time like every
time my biggest fear and weakness was speaking in front of people and what that was was it was very I I had to be
myself I had to use my brain and I think maybe there's an insecurity like will people like my
personality or something I don't really know but I haven't gone to in depth of what my insecurities were back then but I think a lot of you may understand
those of you who don't like public speaking but it was crazy that I was so
loving to perform act and sing no problem no fear it was what I loved to
do but public speaking preaching I don't know want to do it
well God gave me this Revelation how um religion is
performance and is comfortable and it doesn't involve using
your brain the mind of
Christ it's like that it it it it involves you getting
out of your comfort zone it involves you um just like seeking God constantly
L using your heart using your mind meditating you know quieting everything
turning away the distractions and seeking the Holy Spirit and hearing from the Holy Spirit it
requires effort and it requires getting out of your comfort zone because sometimes like it's you you
you hear you try to hear from God and maybe it's quiet and it can be uncomfortable right but the religious
programs the okay I'm just going to fast for these amount of days okay I'm going to go in my room and pray for two hours
and just uh say these impressive religious things oh Lord I believe you're going to move that mountain now I
I call on the angels and I oh Lord oh you are great you are all
powerful I believe you will do this so open the doors open the doors open the doors Lord
you know but it's like performance isn't it and it makes you feel
impressive and very spiritual wo passionate for the Lord you
hear those prayers woo I'm on fire for God hey God's God
sees me on fire yeah oh and after you finish that yes I am a great Christian
yes I prayed today and I prayed as a prayer
Warrior I prayed really good prayers yep I feel good I did my duty as
a Christian today okay now on to doing all my other things in life and then not being spiritual in the
other things and you know turning your ear from God just going on autopilot
because you put in your religious Duty that reminds me so much of the Pharisees too because the Pharisees
they're fasting they're praying they're doing all the religious things and they're even saying to Jesus John
the Baptist disciples and the Pharisees were saying Jesus why are you not fasting Like Us in other words well why
aren't you and your disciples fasting Like Us in other words we are fasting a lot we are fasting for 21 days we are we
we we fast this part the in the New Year we are fasting for a month all of us together we schedule it every
year this is the program that we do we do we fast and we fast and we fast and we fast and we and you over here are not
doing that and you are not fasting as much and you are not fasting you don't have a dedicated day of fasting or
dedicated month why so the Pharisees were in their
religious program religious
performance and Jesus was following the voice of the Lord and he was praying with
understanding he was he was praying in a simp simple way we never see Jesus praying in a religious performance
way and it says he goes often to to be with the Lord often he goes off being quiet with the Lord often goes to the
mountain to pray but it never says he was praying like the Pharisees and fasting like the Pharisees
and never says he was performing rituals praying in a ritual performance
way does it cuz he wasn't he was praying
in Simplicity with understanding understanding of who God was who God is understanding of the
kingdom and so when Jesus when you know when he went to
minister it was very simple he was praying be healed and the people were
healed demon go and the demon left Rise Up from the dead and they Rose
up from the dead stand up get up from your mat and he got up and walked for
the first time in his life very simple eyes open put the hands over the
eyes eyes opened there wasn't religious prayers to
get to see these miracles happen there wasn't performance to see these miracles happen there wasn't this effort this
performing physical effort was there it was
simple it wasn't oh Lord my God this person I
believe you want to heal them I believe you want to heal them oh Lord I pray you will send all the Angels right now I
pray you will send your power from heaven right now I pray Lord you will heal this man oh I believe everybody
come on pray with me pray to God right now God heal him heal him heal him
be healed be healed we don't see that
right when you go and read the gospels if you don't know what I'm talking about go and read the Jesus way of praying it
was simple it wasn't doing extra because that would be being fake
and being performing right so Jesus knew
who God was the father his father was how powerful his father was is and that
that he had anointed him to preach the good news to heal the sick to set the captives free to raise the dead and he
had given him power to do that he had given him authority to do that so he
knew that he was walking in his assignment and the kingdom was backing
him up the kingdom of God government was backing him up so he knew there was not going to be
a struggle to pray a struggle to see the healing and the freedom happen so he'd
say simple be healed with faith part of having understanding brain with
understanding in summary is having faith like belief in all those things I
mentioned in the beginning of God's ways of who he is hallelujah so with faith he knew he knew
I'm going to declare healing and the power of God that God put in me to do this job is going to move through me and
that person is going to be healed be healed and so the Miracles happened because God had anointed him
and because Jesus was praying with understanding he was declaring healing
Freedom praying with understanding not in religion Performance Physical
effort because he had faith it would happen because he knew this is
what he was called to do it must happen that's praying with understanding
that's praying the Jesus way Hallelujah and so the reason that we
are seeing glory to God the reason that we are seeing Miracles taking place here
so mightily and easily like with ease no struggle
the reason why is because number one the anointing is here like for me God God
poured his anointing in me glory to God and called me to be an apostle called me to be a servant of him called me to do
what he called like the apostles to do as the apostles they were praying
exactly the way that Jesus prayed amen when you read in the book of Acts they were praying just as Jesus prayed they
were praying for the sick and oppressed just as Jesus was praying okay so God has called me like how the
apostles were called anointed and so and but now but God has also called me to
walk in faith to have faith and to pray
with understanding to pray in simplicity so the reason that Miracles
take place here like how they did in the acts church is because the anointing is here
we are doing things God's kingdom way in order not in chaos not in
religion and because as I pray I have faith childlike
faith and I pray with understanding I could I could try to do
the the trendy way to pray I don't know I mean the Christian trendy way to pray the trendy religious way to pray or
whatever the common way it is to be to pray maybe I would get more Ministry friends and or something be more popular
if I do do things how they do or something and we wouldn't see God move
like we see him
move it's it's it's it's also having to do with like me as a servant of God praying the Jesus way so this is really
important so we got to make you got to make sure that you you are not enticed
by religion because it's easier easier like how it was easier for
me to act and sing because that's a Temptation for
people be it's a Temptation because that's the mainstream Christian
way in the Revival God is bringing pouring out his new wine so we're getting out of the old wine so that's
why I say it's like the mainstream Christian way today there's a lot of work to be done in the body of Christ there's a lot of religion there's a lot of old wine and the evidence is that
we're not seeing the fruits we're not seeing the signs we're not seeing Miracles we're not seeing the power of God by and
large why no new wine no praying with
understanding no not doing things God's way so since it's the popular way it's
the popular way of praying I'll say I mean it's the mainstream Christian way of praying and fasting is the religious
way okay and so if you do things the way most people are doing it you can tend to
think well number one they'll accept me people will accept me more and number two well everyone's doing it that most
people are doing it that way so I'll just follow the bandwagon that's the easy way and
also it's this religious way is like checking things off the list like how I describe the acting I memorize the lines
I practice practice practice perform it's all good is great so that's how religion could be
check off the list I perform my religious rituals I perform the fasting I perform the
praying I perform even the Bible reading doing everything in a religious
way and it makes you feel I'm a good
Christian rather than Walking with God and opening your ears to hear his
conviction and praying with understanding amen
am so a relationship with God a relationship with God slash prayer
prayer in general is about walking in
faith following his principles
understanding the kingdom of God how the kingdom of God
operates and communion with God that's what your relationship with
God is supposed to be about this is a this is a sermon by the way you need to go back and write notes there's a lot of
meat and there's a lot of like bullet point type things you got to write down okay so go back and watch this message
several times and write notes okay I'm going to list this again relationship with God is about walking in faith
following his principles understanding the kingdom of
God how it operates and communion with God so now I'm going to I I talked about walking in faith now now I want to talk
about following his principles and understanding the kingdom of God so what I mean by that
is it there there's a um scripture see if I have it
here acts 5:14 yet more and more people believed and were brought to the Lord
crowds of both men and women as a result of the Apostles work sick people were brought out into the streets on beds and
mats so that Peter's Shadow might fall across some of them as he went by crowds came from The Villages around Jerusalem
bringing their sick and those possessed by evil spirits and they were all
healed Hallelujah so um
that scripture right here this is God's kingdom way of healing and
delivering is locating God's Kingdom on this Earth in the body of Christ
locating the kingdom government locating the Servants of God God has anointed in
in this day in the acts Church Peter was one of them Peter was one of the leaders Peter was one of the generals who
carried high level anointing and Authority so the people located where
the kingdom government was because where you find the kingdom government is where you find God's power where you find the
Miracles taking place so you know today people they're
they're not praying with understanding about God's kingdom and his ways they're praying they're in the room every night
God heal me God heal me God heal me God heal me for years God heal me God heal
me they are not praying with understanding in the Bible God shows us
how he heals and delivers it's not randomly for the most part God does whatever he wants sometimes he doesn't
use a servant of God to heal but that's one that's the um outliers but his main way his main
principle is by using vessels whom he's anointed so people pray in their rooms
for years and nothing happen happens God heard their prayer but they're not
praying with understanding there's the scripture that I read last week that says you you you don't receive because
you do not ask the revelation of that is you are not praying you are not asking
with understanding what you are supposed to do is pray you find sickness in your
body you find demonic oppression you find lack of provision whatever it is you ask God you request him for this
Lord he me I believe you will heal me by his stripes you are healed I heal me Lord I want to receive your healing your
freedom but the but God's already spoken to you how you find that prayer answered
where he's going to answer that prayer his way of answering the prayer
here so so now you pray and now you do something you you follow God's
word so now you find where God's moving power and you simply position yourself
under the shadow just as they did in the times of Peter and all were healed all were free why we all healed why we all
free because they were going in line with God's ways one of the biggest reasons people
are not receiving Miracles today and they're not walking in Abundant Life is simply they are not following God's ways
and principles this is how I heal this is how I free just go do it and then you'll
find me there seek me with all of your heart and then you'll find
me people are seeking God not with all their heart but with religion with performance with ritual with
pride when you humble yourself then I will heal your land when I when you humble yourself then you will hear my
voice in my word you will get rid of this nonsense Pharisee religious garbage
that people are speaking in your ear you'll you'll reject those lies you'll be unashamed of me and you'll come to
Apostle Peter of today Servants of God walking in the anointing today and be healed and be
free Hallelujah so this is an example of
God's way and ways and principles and there's so many different ways and principles I teach about them a lot um
there's so many different ones like his way of bringing protection his way of
equipping his people and releasing impartation is by doing that in the
church through his anointed servants a five-fold minister or ministers so he
calls every one of his children to go to where his P power of God is in a church to go to plant themselves in a church
where God is moving in power where God is calling them and that's how they will have a covering of protection over of
them that's how they will be equipped their eyes will open up they will go from baby to mature believer they will
have revelation of the the kingdom and be able to read the word of God with understanding with Revelation because they've been equipped in the house of
God and they will receive impartation of anointing and they will be powerful vessels of God they will have the signs
following them but people are in their rooms praying anoint me Lord I've fasted for
you for days look how I've sacrificed for you
and oh Lord I Surrender everything I'll do whatever you want to send me Lord
send me to the ends of the Earth anoint me Lord anoint me so so my cup shall
overflow anoint me Lord people pray these lofty prayers over and over hours
and they think they're being so spiritual meanwhile they are dry as a
desert not a drop of anointing but if they could just simply
say Lord I Surrender I want to be used by you how you please in their normal voice how
they talk to people they talk to God as a person they respect him enough to talk to him as a person not as an actor
performing they speak with Simplicity from the heart they give him that respect Lord I Surrender and I just want
to be used by you however you want whatever you want to do with my life I will do it and I read in your word that
these signs shall follow us they shall heal the sick they shall cast out demons I read in your word that that we are
supposed to be anointed and and so Lord anoint me use
me how you will use me in power however you want Lord and so you pray that but
then you don't ignore the word you pray with understanding you find in the word
you find in Ephesians 41:16 the fivefold ministry God gave to equip the body to
impart anointing you find Timothy being the spiritual son of apostle Paul you
you find these God's ways in his word so you say Okay God's been showing these
videos on my on my Instagram of this servant of God walking
in anointing people are testifying of so many miracles they've received here and
how also they're walking they're have receiving impartation and they're seeing the power of God flow through their lives okay
this is God speaking through wisdom through understanding of his ways this
is God speaking I need to go there to this church and then you go to the church and
then God heals you and God delivers you if you need that and then God pours his anointing in you and now you're walking
in the anointing prayer answered but you have to pray with understanding and do things God's
ways people are are are praying for Revival still they are they are calling
for fasts for months fasting praying for Revival but but Revival is
here it's like it's like the Pharisees that it's like the Pharisees
oh Lord when you bring your Messiah oh Lord we're fasting and praying for the
Messiah to come and there Jesus is standing before them and they're mocking him and they're ridiculing him and
they're saying he's from the devil and then the next day oh Lord send your Messiah we will Fast more for you to
send us our Messiah it's how it is today Revival is
here and when you're praying and fasting for Revival that God has already brought
you are wasting time and you're doing nothing for the king you're not being useful for the
kingdom you were called to do God's ways come where his power is come and receive
this anointing come receive impartation of anointing humble
yourself so you can be be effective for the Kingdom so you see we're not another
reason you know how long it took for me to to memorize all these
lines I could be doing that to this day no God can use actors I'm not saying that but I'm just saying for my calling
right now I could be doing that today still but instead God has me seeking his face and preaching his
word right so so God can use by the way I I'm just
just using this as an analogy to of religion um so if you're an actor God is using you praise God and I bless you and
God wants to use you in that industry this is just my specific calling so that's why I'm giving that
example but that's like Religion Today you praying and fasting imagine you Lord
anoint me send Revival you're doing all these religious things meanwhile you're
do you could have been going to where the power of God is to the Revival be set free be healed receive impartation
of anointing be casting out demons out of people be Healing The Sick be you be
be advancing the kingdom of God but you're still praying and you're still fasting you're doing the religious
performance thing waste of time waste of time so this is what what
God really wants you to understand to have his mind that he's not he's not
like I want you to fast for all these days and pray these performance sounding
prayers just CU I want to and then I'm going to move that's not
God you know he he's simple he's he's caring about
his people being reached so he doesn't want he's not going to be making you waste your time doing religious things
prayers when you could be using that time to serve him and actually be doing
work for the Kingdom so it's better to pray simply to pray simple with not as many
words and then believe that God is going to do it and then go and do what is
required what his principles are to find that request and Trust in
his timing so let me teach you now how to pray the Jesus way if you have a
request um so let's say let's say it's provision let's say it's
provision Lord I believe that you have all the
riches in your kingdom and I am your child and I believe you want to provide
you will provide for me and I and it it says in the
word
um Matthew 625 that this this is that is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life whether you have enough
food and drink or enough clothes to wear isn't life more than food and your body more
than clothing look at the birds they don't plant or harvest or sto food sore food in barns for your heavenly father
feeds them and aren't you far more valuable to him than they are can all
your worries add a single moment to your life and why worry about your clothing look at the lies of the field and how
they grow they don't work or make their clothing yet Solomon in all his Glory was not dressed as beautifully as they
are and if God cares so wonderfully for wild flowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow he will
certainly care for you why do you have so little faith so don't worry about these things saying what will we eat
what will we drink what will we wear these things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers but your heavenly father
already knows all your needs seek the kingdom of God above all else and live righteously and he will give you
everything you need
so this is the mind of Christ God God God has all of the riches
and he wants to provide for you so worrying should never ever be happening
ever and prayer worrying should never be a thing oh pleas God that's not
Faith so it says so so don't worry about these things saying what will we eat what will we drink what will we wear
these things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers but your heavenly father
already knows all your needs seek the kingdom of God above all
else and live righteously and he will give you everything you
[Applause] need seek the kingdom of
God seek the king the kingdom of God is having to do with the work of God is
having to do with advancing God's kingdom is having to do with the power of God because the the Bible says the
kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power so if you're seeking the kingdom
of God you're seeking his power to do the works like you're seeking his anointed
Church to come and be a part of it to receive from there to contribute there to serve
there to sew there to be equipped there to receive impartation there so that you can contribute in every way to the
kingdom work seek first the
kingdom this doesn't mean just go in your room and seek and and pray and pray
seek seek seek God is in prayer in that way praying in a religious way seek first the kingdom of God it says the
kingdom of God live righteously and he will give
you everything you need
so you you you will see Abundant Life come to you when you actually seek first
the kingdom of God so what I'm teaching you today it's very important you don't just take this
and apply it to your religious life you're living apply app it to the where
you are at a lukewarm church and continue on living how you're living whatever way you want to live the the
the popular way mainstream Christian way to live today seek first the kingdom of God and
all of these things will be given all right so when you are surrendered to God you are obedient to God you have planted
yourself where God's power is and you are being a true disciple
there now there's nothing to worry
about and that and like when things crop up if you
need healing or Freedom simple easy go position yourself under Peter Shadow go
to where the power of God's moving at your church and get the healing and get the
freedom Steve come here I just remember sh your testimony from this
week he just shared a testimony this week and my go God just reminded me of
this can you just share quickly what happened on the live this this Wednesday sure yeah so uh um I had like nerve
sciatic nerve kind of pain for quite a few weeks it was kind of mild but it
still was there and it was really bothering me and so apostle was just
starting to minister to people on the live and she she said um I see God
touching somebody's thigh right now and I was just like amen I receive this and I I started feeling the warmth I started
feeling this warm sensation right underneath my thigh right where that pain was and it left me it
left praise God um so yeah I
just and I was so expectant I was actually expectant and I didn't really know exactly what Jesus was going to do
for me but I was just like I was expecting and I just I was just I knew
the anointing could locate every need that I had and and just take care of me
completely hallelujah thank you Steve praise God praise God so Steve you
probably recognize him he plays the guitar here at church so he's seeking first the kingdom of God he's serving
here weekly and he's coming every single Sunday he's planted he's being a true
disciple and um and here it is it's a Wednesday
and he's he he finds a problem and he needs healing in his life something crops up sometimes right
in life you need healing so he positions himself where the anointed is and the
power of God touched him see first the kingdom of God above
all else live righteously and he will give you everything you need everything you need so I I just I love that example
that's prophetic that's just an example like but there's people who are rejecting the power of God they are they
prefer their lukewarm churches they prefer mainstream um culture of today
Christianity culture of today the norm they prefer that but they're missing out
greatly like they're not seeking first the kingdom and they're not receiving the benefits they're not receiving the
provision the healing the freedom that we're supposed to receive as children of God easily on a Wednesday tuning in
online you know so that that that that's a big big
part I want to start with when I'm teaching you about how to pray with understanding you got to make sure you're seeking first the kingdom of God
you got to do things God's ways to see your prayers be answered
amen okay so now you you you you have you pray with this under understanding you pray with understanding of this
scripture provision instead of Lord I don't know how I'm going to pay for my
bill this month I don't want to go on the street I'm so
worried that's that's that's not praying with
understanding that's not praying with understanding of the scripture right
and this is important because faith is what unlocks the
Miracles so it's important that we pray the Jesus way to see the Jesus
results the the the the the blessings from Jesus the the the fruits the Miracles amen and so instead
you should pray with faith and understanding in simplicity Lord I believe that you will
provide for me I request this I ask for this I ask for this provision Lord that
I would have money to pay for my bills this month and that's it that's the
prayer you don't have to repeat it again and again you don't have to add tongues
to it or something to make it more effective you don't have to add a
fasting to it to make it more effective you don't have to raise your voice voice and say oh Lord of Heaven and Earth for
you have provided all the food to the children of Israel in the desert you
know you don't have to like you know make a poem out of the prayer or anything you know you you can just pray
simply simply and then number
two make sure you're being planted get ready to receive receive this
anointing Hallelujah and then you have to go and
knock on doors if you like well for for for for some people it it's not about
money is they just need money to fall from the sky it's that they need to look for a job or they need to look for a
higher pain job you know if if if the lack of provision is the issue so what's
important is is that you knock on the door you look you go you be active and you follow God's principles of knock and
the door will be opened to you you follow God's principles that says if we
don't work we will not eat but those who work hard they are blessed and
prosperous the Bible says things like this amen so we follow God's principles
and we do these things and as we do these things we know the kingdom government is backing me up
the kingdom government is is moving on my behalf is opening
doors God is sending his kingdom government to do these things for me we walk in that faith we walk with that
expectancy I prayed I'm coming where God's power is and this is a big one
this is a really big one lots of times it won't even be it won't even be a request maybe
like um you know you you you had a a sickness happen or oppression or provi
lack of provision whatever during the week but you're planed where God's power is and so you have this Faith this
anointing is being released to me every week multiple times it's being released to me so if
you find something you're missing where you need a miracle some you don't even have to say
Lord Give Me This I need this sometimes you can just you most of the time you
can just walk in the fa you can walk in that faith knowing you have everything you need you need to position yourself
you need to expect you need to come with faith you know and and so you you know
maybe something happened that week and you you you didn't even ask but you're just you're just coming expectant I need
I need healing I need Freedom well I'm coming to meet Jesus today Jesus the anointed one I'm coming where his power
is being released and I'm going to receive my Miracle so you come and you know I I I
declare over all of you and I release and I don't have to say the specific thing I don't have to say the very
specific you know sickness to go or whatever it is Jesus doing every miracal
and he knows what you need so I release the anointing and God does what he wants
with that anointing that's with his anointing that's being released and I'll say I speak healing to
every person so when that word Goes Forth whatever kind of sickness pain you have
that anointing must locate you must go to heal you when I say every single
demonic Spirit must go this anointing must locate every
demon and it must leave so I do not need to say Spirit of addiction Spirit of
depression Spirit of anxiety spirit I don't have to recite everything many times when I'm when I'm
doing that it's to help people who don't have enough Faith amen but I don't have to recite
everything so you need to lift your faith and know whatever is you need this
anointing the power of God Jesus himself is going to locate you here and release that
miracle and so and so let's say you you you need
provision so you come to the church you're coming expectant Lord I know this
is how you can pray it doesn't have to be like a Lord please give me this you can pray like this
Lord I believe in your power that is moving at 5f church at my church I
believe that I will be healed I believe that I will be free here I believe you're going to touch me and I thank you in advance
Lord amen so you I believe you'll release a provision to me today so you
come you come expectant you come with faith and you simply receive you should also show God
respect thank him thank him with a sacrifice thank him with an offering just to just to thank him not that you
need to but to Value what you have received so that you don't lose
it if we treat things as cheap it's easier to to lose them amen but that's
it you just simply receive simply receive the words declare so then let's say Monday comes Tuesday
comes you're not seeing the provision yet let me tell you the wrong way to pray Lord please give me the
provision the right way to pray I believe that that word that was
declared on Sunday by Apostle Katherine I believe I have received that word I
believe that anointing touched me I believe now things are happening in the
spiritual realm door are opening up and the provision is surely being released I
believe and I thank you Jesus I receive it I thank you
Lord and then if you need to you know knock on doors and be looking for a job if there if that's something that you're
supposed to be doing then you need to do those things you know or if it's healing you haven't seen the healing yet there's
nothing really you need to do most cases is but just keep believing keep thanking
God but you don't you don't have to repeat requesting the prayer it will manifest it will
happen
hallelujah praise God praise God so
um rightly so this is a big topic how to
pray the Jesus way cuz this is such a big part of our Lives such a big part of
our relationship with God so I'm not going to give you all of this meat all of the other other things
I was going to share with you today we're going to save that for next Sunday amen um because I think you got a lot
today amen a lot to meditate on and get in you um but so so I'm going to be for I
just want to end with this what prayers do um or or I'm sorry these are the
types of prayers when we say pray because many times people don't know what prayer means like their mind just goes to religious praying you know so
praying the Jesus way what prayer really means is communion with God
friendship like communion intimacy number
two requesting like requesting for miracles that you
need there's this need for miracles so you pray you
request and also there are there's requests that are desires of your heart
so that's different from like 911 you need healing you need freedom and God
wants to destroy the works of the devil in your life right now that's different from you want a husband you want a wife you want children you want a house you
you know those desires of your heart you know
um so those are the different um types
of oh and and then also lastly another request is
um praying praying as a me as a member of the body of Christ praying like
intercessing praying for Revival you know pray praying for things that are not about you you know
um and the last part of prayer is uh walking in
Authority praying as you walk in authority so we've only got to like one of these
today we've got to I've taught you today um how to pray for requests of the need
of Mira when you need Miracles how to pray amen
so that's what you've learned today that's one aspect of prayer
Hallelujah so um I'm so excited for how your lives
have changed from this word I know your your lives have changed and it's time to start praying
with understanding and praying in Simplicity and praying like a child and praying like Jesus
amen hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus
