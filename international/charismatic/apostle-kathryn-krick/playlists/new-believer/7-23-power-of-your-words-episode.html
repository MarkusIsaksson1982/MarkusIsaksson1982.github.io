hi I'm Apostle Catherine and welcome to
another episode of Revival is now it is
God's will for you to have Abundant Life
in every area we see in the book of Acts
that the children of God were walking in
Abundant Life if they were sick they
were being healed by God's power if they
were oppressed they were being delivered
demons are being cast out they were
walking in Abundant Life now in this
revival God is restoring his power to
heal deliver and release Abundant Life
so I've been teaching you now that it is
here his power is here to release
healing and freedom how to access it and
on the last episode you learned the
importance of walking in Authority one
of them major things Jesus did on the
cross was give you authority over the
devil and so if you want to walk in
Abundant Life you have to walk in
authority and constantly reject the
devil's lies constantly reject the
devil's portion what he wants for your
life you have to keep rejecting it and
keep walking in that authority of I want
God's will today I'm going to teach you
how to walk in authority to learn how to
walk in authority where we need to go is
the word of God in the beginning God
created the whole universe and in the
beginning it was just God and so
obviously God was the one in authority
and as he creates he's he does something
powerful he speaks let there be light he
speaks this he doesn't just think it he
does an action of speaking talking and
when he spoke there was light as he said
let there be light boom there was light
and he goes on and continues to speak
and speaks creation into existence this
is our first example of what walking
Authority looks like God speaks there
was so much power and so much change
just by a simple word the tongue can
bring death or life Jesus has returned
authority to you because God gave
authority originally to Adam and Eve he
said let them have dominion authority
over creation Jesus returned that
authority to you you are in God's image
so just as God spoke when you speak your
words carry so much power your words
carry life or death literally in the
spiritual realm if you could see your
words if you could see like fight or
coming out of your mouth you would be
shocked
power of the every word you speak so the
meaning of your words can bring life or
death is if you are speaking life which
is God's will if you're speaking in
agreement with God's word his heart his
promises you are speaking life and you
are bringing life because you're given
Authority God's promises God's will
comes through you you partner with God
because God has chosen to use us on this
Earth so every word you speak is either
partnering with God and bringing Heaven
down and God's will to come to pass or
your words are death and the meaning of
that is agreeing with the devil's will
agreeing with the devil's lies and when
you do that you are literally accepting
and pushing forth the devil's plans for
your life and others lives around you
the tongue can bring death or life those
who love to talk will reap the
consequences that's meaning those who
love to talk but they're not thinking
about what they're saying and they're
just talking they're saying whatever
they're going to reap this the careless
words that they say if they love to talk
and they're not thinking about what
they're saying the words of death are
coming out
there are
seeds that are being planted of death
that they will reap those words of death
in their life now we're going to look at
the example of Jesus Jesus when he came
to this earth one of the big things he
did not only was to save us but also to
be an example for us of what being a
disciple of the Lord looks like he was
demonstrating to us how to walk in
authority when Jesus is on this Earth
he's constantly walking in authority and
destroying the devil's works and
bringing the father's will to come to
pass so all these times that Jesus is
healing delivering preaching he's
walking in Authority through all of this
in Mark 4 39 Jesus was with the
disciples they were in a boat there was
a big storm like a scary storm dangerous
and Jesus just he gets up
he rebuked the wind and said to the Sea
hush be still
so Jesus spoke to the storm to the
threat upon his and his disciples lives
he spoke he spoke with authority those
are authoritative words and it says and
the wind died down and there was at once
a great calm Jesus demonstrated to us
how to walk in authority and see the
threats of the devil completely vanish
because the devil has to obey the
authority of Jesus Christ Jesus's friend
and disciple Lazarus he had died too
early it wasn't his time yet to go to
heaven this was a work of the devil he
died but Jesus
he rose him from the dead and how did he
do this it says in John 11 43 then with
a loud voice Jesus shouted with
authority Lazarus come out of the Tomb
so he used his words and spoke these
words with authority once again
authoritative words and as he's doing
this he's basically saying death you
can't hold him down it's not lazarus's
time yet and Lazarus rose from the dead
and when we look at Jesus casting out
demons he also is speaking speaking with
authority he had been saying to him the
demon come out of the man you unclean
Spirit he's speaking to the Demonic
spirit and commanding the spirit to go
time and time again throughout the
gospels we see Jesus doing this this is
how he's casting out demons is he's
speaking speaking with authority demons
goat and they have to obey the commands
of Jesus there was a person who was deaf
and mute and once again Jesus speaks he
speaks to open up the ears and the mouth
be opened and released and one time a
centurion Soldier comes to Jesus and he
says Lord my servant is lying at home
paralyzed with intense and terrible
tormenting pain
Jesus said to him I will come and heal
him like I will come in person and pray
for him
but the Centurion replied to him Lord I
am not worthy to have you come under my
roof but only say the word and my
servant will be healed for I also am a
man subject to Authority with soldiers
subject to me and I say to one go and he
goes and to another come and he comes
and to my slave do this and he does it
when Jesus heard this he was amazed and
said to those who are following him I
tell you truthfully I have not found
such great faith as this with anyone in
Israel Jesus says to the Centurion go it
will be done for you as you believed and
the servant was restored to Health at
that very hour this Centurion Soldier he
rejects Jesus's proposal to come in
person and heal a servant because he had
revelation of what actually made the
sickness the demonic spirits to go it
was the authority that Jesus carried
that's why the Centurion Soldier is
bringing up all these examples of him
walking in Authority he's saying I
understand what actually makes sickness
go and demons go it is not something in
the Physical Realm it's not about you
being near a person but it's about the
authority you carry and then the
Centurion Soldier goes on to say I'm a
person of authority and not just that he
goes on to say you know this is how I
execute Authority I just speak something
I speak something simply and things
happen my soldiers obey me my soldiers
obey the words and get things done he's
revealing how his spiritual eyes were
opened he knows what will make his
servant be healed is Jesus executing his
authority by speaking words that's it
that that's all that's needed that's the
key that's what brings healing
Deliverance the will of God change is by
using your Authority
and by using your Authority you speak
Jesus
is amazed you can see Jesus is just
blessed by this Centurion soldier's
faith Jesus was like he gets it and
Jesus was so excited because you know he
says I've I've not found such great
faith wow that this is the example of
finding such great faith
yes because
this guy has the kind of faith that
works you can believe in Jesus just that
he exists but that kind of faith alone
you won't see healing and deliverance
you need to believe specifically in
Jesus that Jesus is your healer and
deliverer to begin to receive healing
and deliverance
but also you cannot just stop at Jesus
as my healer and deliverer you need to
understand have faith in the way that
Jesus releases his miracles Jesus uses
vessels he puts anointing and Authority
in vessels
he says to his disciples I've given you
Authority now to cast that demons to
heal the sick so the big way that we are
seeing miracles happen how we saw it in
the ACT Church how we're seeing it now
in this revival
is by God using vessels with anointing
and authority and those vessels
speaking executing their Authority by
speaking it's not really about physical
touch it's not about one-on-one prayer
it is simply about an anointed vessel of
God executing their Authority properly
speaking with authority this Centurion
Soldier had Faith to receive any kind of
miracle
other people would not have the faith to
receive the miracle of just Jesus
speaking and they wouldn't receive it
Jesus would have to go in person Jesus
can do more miracles now if everyone can
have this kind of Faith this proper kind
of faith of really what makes God's will
be done healing Deliverance happen
Darkness flee and then we see Jesus
teaching his disciples about walking in
authority and the power of their words
truly I tell you whoever says to this
mountain be lifted up and thrown into
the sea and does not doubt it all in his
heart but believes that what he says
will take place it will be done for him
Jesus does not say whoever believes that
I the father will move the mountain it
will be moved Jesus specifically says
whoever says to this mountain be lifted
and thrown into the sea
and does not doubt in his heart would
but believes that what he says will take
place it will be done for him so Jesus
is is teaching his disciples right now
your words carry power I have given you
Authority and this is how you need to
walk in authority by speaking and when
you do this because I've given you
Authority your words carry so much power
that even a whole Mountain could be
thrown into the sea
and this is speaking of mountains in the
spiritual realm mountains of demonic
strongholds oppressions dry Barren land
we know that salvation comes by grace
through faith but it is really
everything that Jesus wants to give you
you receive it by grace through faith so
you need to believe that Jesus has given
you Authority you need to believe that
your words carry power and this is how
you execute your Authority you need to
believe that what you say will happen
when you believe that you have authority
that your words carry power that what
you says will happen
then it will happen I vividly remember
the day that I received this Revelation
from God I heard a message about the
power of your words like you're hearing
today and as I was hearing that word my
spiritual eyes opened up and understood
that Revelation it's like I became like
the Centurion Soldier where I got it
leave
from that day forward
I became so careful over my words from
that day
I was changed because of this Revelation
I received and the fear of God came over
me
where I was such a talkative person most
of us are natural in Instinct we love to
talk we love to just be with our friends
and just talk and talk and just talk
about whatever sometimes it feels good
to talk sometimes it feels good to be
heard sometimes there's gossiping that
happens sometimes complaining feels good
this is of the flesh I'm speaking this
is what's like instinct of the flesh and
without spiritual maturity it feels like
no big problem to just complain once in
a while just say whatever whatever's on
your mind however you feel but the truth
is this your words carry death or life
you will eat from your from your words
either poison or fruit and so I at the
time seven years ago was a very
talkative person
and when I grabbed this Revelation I
became so quiet and I only spoke with
intention every time I spoke I had to
make sure
it aligns with God's word
it's pleasing to God the Bible says let
the words of my mouth the meditation of
my heart be pleasing to you it had to be
edifying somebody
had to be speaking life over myself
never death it had to be only speaking
life over other people and when I
started Living with this intention every
day I Saw My Life Begin to change
now I can tell you that I am truly
walking an abundant life in every area
and the biggest reason I've been able to
see this happen in my life because I
started speaking with such intention
because I started taking such care over
every word I spoke
so practically how should you walk in
authority with your words every time the
devil is attacking you in your life
attacking your inheritance from Jesus
you need to speak up this is the action
of resisting the devil and he will flee
from you speaking sickness must lead my
body pain must lead my body depression
must get out anxiety must leave my mind
Jesus has given me perfect peace Jesus
has given me a sound mind Jesus has
given me Abundant Health by his stripes
I am healed I declare all lack out of my
life Jesus has provided for me all that
I need I have abundance in every area
this includes my finances I declare
there to be abundance in my bank account
there will not be division in my family
in my marriage our family my marriage we
will be United I love my children you
can be feeling so frustrated at them
inside but you speak I love them you
could you could go in your room and just
speak I love them I bless them I declare
Unity as you are speaking these words as
you are rejecting the devil with your
words and as you are speaking God's will
you are using your Authority you are
saying devil there's no Open Door you're
gonna come in I'm locking all the doors
and I am declaring I'm using my
authority and saying God's will must be
done in my life in my family no matter
what the devil's will will never be done
in my family you're putting your foot
down you're executing your Authority and
because Jesus is giving you you
authority over the devil
devil must flee your feelings many times
are not your own but they are lies from
the devil your thoughts many times are
not your own but they are lies from the
devil so you need to be aware of the
every lie in your mind of the every
attack of the devil and you need to take
authority over it all I reject that
impure desire and thought and craving in
my head right now I reject every thought
of hate and jealousy and envy and
selfishness I bless the person you are
having feelings of jealousy or hate for
Speak Life over them this is the action
of you saying devil you're not going to
come and bring Yokes in my life you're
not going to have your way with my life
God's will must be done in my life this
is a big like rewiring you need to do in
your head your mind I mean the Bible
says renew your mind with the word of
God so you are having your mind renewed
right now and this is very new for many
of you you have to spend time to get
this to be so in you for what has been
stored up in your hearts will be heard
in the Overflow of your words so to make
sure what you're speaking is life you
need to meditate on the right things the
right things are the word of God the
right things are the word of God present
tense like this is a Rhema word that
means present tense what you're hearing
today is a present tense word of God
bringing Revelation from the logos
written word of God you need to meditate
on what I'm speaking today
get this in you so it's in your heart so
it's stored up in your heart so it just
becomes an overflow out of you it's like
if you swear a lot you can't hide it you
can try to be all prim and proper in
front of important people but
eventually it's going to come out in the
same way if you never swear the swear
words are not even in your vocabulary so
even when pressure comes and normal
people would swear so much naturally
fast
those words are not even in you there
was a time I
I remember I would stub my toe and it
would really hurt and I would mean but I
would start praying in tongues and I
didn't even like try to do it but I was
like oh Hallelujah I was like really
excited you know what what had been in
my heart was good like I had been
practicing brain in the spirit and I
would just focusing on Jesus so much
that
it that's what was in my heart it came
out so your whole life you might not
have had much care over your words today
you need to decide to make a complete
change a 360. and every day start with
the intention in your mind and your
heart I'm gonna walk in authority today
that Jesus has given me
I'm going to walk in authority by
speaking I'm going to make sure that all
of my words are words of Life all of my
words are aligning with God's will I'm
going to make sure every attack of the
enemy that comes I'm not going to let
him just come I'm gonna reject him like
a policeman or woman I'm gonna take him
captive Every Lie every thought captive
and make it obedient to Christ I am not
allowing the Devil to come in any room
of my house he can't camp out sneak in I
am being strict I am using my authority
and when I hear the knock on the door to
try to come in I'm gonna speak and say
leave my house alone leave my temple of
the Holy Spirit alone and get out of
here as you read God's word you're
meditating on it you're getting his
heart his will in you in your heart make
this practice of spending time in the
word of God and with the Revelation that
you're getting God's will in you so you
become just this vessel of authority
who's just naturally walking in God's
authority never slipping up and speaking
a word of death when I first started
taking it so seriously the words I spoke
I had to think about it a lot I had to
like stop myself from speaking any word
of death it was like work you know it
took a lot of care a lot of attention
intention but as I kept doing that
spiritual work kept obeying god with
every step with every word
I was transformed this practice that was
first foreign started to become me I
mean it started to become so natural so
like now I don't have to try and think
so hard words of death aren't a part of
me just words of life and so that's how
it will be for you and this is how you
will really be thriving in God's
Abundant Life and the devil can't come
in any area because you've been so
transformed to be so much like Jesus
that there's no way he can sneak in and
find a word of death you're pure you're
full of life you're overflowing with
life and the words of Jesus I know as
you put this into practice you will see
your life transform and even quickly so
obey Jesus in this way with excitement
with joy and may your prayer every day
be let the words of my mouth the
meditation of my heart be pleasing to
you Lord and I use my Authority that
Jesus has given me to command Darkness
to leave you right now I break every
word curse that you spoke over your life
your future your family a big curse
right now that God is breaking is the
word curse of death of suicide
there's some of you watching who have
said the words I want to die and when
you speak I want to die you're actually
making a covenant with a demon of
suicide of death and so to be free from
that to be free from the suicidal
thoughts and that curse and Covenant you
need to renounce
speaking those words and also if there
are any other words of death that God's
putting on your heart right now maybe
you said I'll always be poor I am poor I
am sick I have this sickness my marriage
won't make it we'll probably get a
divorce I'll never be able to do what
God called me to do if you've ever
spoken those kinds of words right now
just renounce some renowned specifically
what it was that you said you can say I
renounce saying I wanted to die I
renounce saying I have this sickness
claiming it partnering with the devil's
lies a sickness you can speak this right
now
I cancel every Covenant of death and
suicide and I cancel every Covenant of
death of word curses you spoke over
yourself I break every word curse you
spoke over yourself and word curse is
spoken over you and I command on three
every Spirit attached every Spirit of
death must leave you in Jesus name
one two three
out now
I speak life over you now I speak
Abundant Life I declare God's will must
be done in your life I speak this
anointing to touch you and fill you and
Empower you to speak Words of Life only
and may you receive healing Freedom
Abundant Life now in Jesus name I'm
going to show you now an example of the
power of your words and how when you
speak with authority demons sickness and
all kinds of Darkness must go
