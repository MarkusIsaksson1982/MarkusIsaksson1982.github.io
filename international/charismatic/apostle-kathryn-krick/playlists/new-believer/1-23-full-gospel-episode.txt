hi i'm apostle catherine and welcome to
another episode of revival is now
in this revival god is restoring what we
see in the book of acts to the body of
christ today and one of the big things
that's missing is the power of god by
and large
in the acts church healing's deliverance
his miracles were happening all the time
and it even says that when people who
were sick and even possessed went
underneath apostle peter's shadow
they were all healed
so this is what's happening in this
revival is it's time for healings
deliverances miracles it's time for you
to be healed and delivered and receive
whatever miracle you need
so today we are going to learn
the first step in how to
receive miracles from jesus
jesus said to his disciples go into all
the world and preach the gospel to every
creature
step one is for you to hear and believe
in the gospel of jesus christ
now some of you may have never heard the
gospel and you'll hear it for the first
time but at the same time there are many
of you who have heard
the gospel
but there's a part of the gospel you
have never heard before perhaps and
today you'll hear what that is for god
so loved the world that he gave his one
and only son that whoever believes in
him shall not perish but have eternal
life god sent his only son jesus as a
sacrifice for us to save us to save us
from sin from going to hell he saved us
so that we could have eternal life so
when we die we will go to heaven and
live with god for eternity god made him
who had no sin to be sin for us so that
in him we might become the righteousness
of god number two jesus took all of our
sins away and we became the
righteousness of god
so when you give your life to jesus when
you confess that jesus is lord
you have received this free gift from
god that all of your sins are taken away
jesus was perfect we were sin
he became sin for us he took on what we
should have taken on that suffering and
that pain and death but jesus took it on
as a sacrifice so we wouldn't have to so
now when he did that he removed all of
our sins and we became the righteousness
of god he actually calls us you are the
righteousness of god meaning you're in
right standing with god you don't have
to do anything to be my child is how god
sees it you are my child you are pure
you are the righteousness of god before
jesus came people were bound by sin
there was the law which had so many
parts to it and they would try to
fulfill the law
to be in right standing with god but
because there were so many and because
we as humans are naturally sinful in
nature they could never measure up they
could never fulfill all the laws they
would make sacrifices to try to cover up
their sins they would make sacrifices of
animals and that blood would cover their
sins temporarily but it would never
completely remove their sins so people
were just living
as sinners
jesus came and he took away our sins
completely the sins are removed
past present and future and now you are
no longer a sinner you are a child of
god you are pure you're the
righteousness of god and as long as
you're seeking god
daily you've given your life to him
that's how god's always seen you we are
on a journey to be transformed into the
image of god so that means that you may
make mistakes sometimes you may sin
sometimes but that doesn't make you a
sinner as long as you're repentant and
you turn to god and you say i'm sorry
help me lord i don't want to do this sin
again god immediately forgives you
immediately removes your sin doesn't
even remember it
and he calls you the righteousness of
god pure
as soon as you repent you could have
sinned
one minute ago but you repent
earnestly from your heart
god's forgotten it already the next
thing that jesus has given us is he tore
the veil in the spiritual realm so that
there is no longer a barrier between us
and god communication
between us and god but now we can have
direct
contact and intimacy with the holy
spirit therefore brethren having
boldness to enter the holiest by the
blood of jesus by a new and living way
which he consecrated for us through the
veil that is his flesh let us draw near
with a true heart in full assurance of
faith in the old testament the presence
of god was in a temple it was in the
holiest of holies in a room within rooms
and only
a couple priests
could actually go to the holy of holies
once in a while
no one else could go there so no one
else could be in direct contact with the
presence of god there was a veil you
couldn't go through
jesus tore the veil
so now that means that holy spirit has
come to live inside of you the moment
you receive jesus as the lord and savior
of your life and you are one there's no
veil anymore he's literally one with you
and he's always with you he never leaves
you you can talk with him anytime you
don't need a middle man you can have
intimacy with holy spirit
without anything else that's it now you
might have heard the gospel before what
i've just shared
and think that that's it
in fact that was me
up until
about seven years ago
i had only heard
that jesus died for our sins holy spirit
lives in us now and we go to heaven when
we die
i only heard that
when i heard the gospel that's all i
heard i thought that's all that there
was and i'd heard the gospel
a lot of times and then seven years ago
i went to a little house church and
there i encountered the power of god for
the first time
i saw demons manifest and be cast out of
people i saw people be healed
i encountered prophetic ministry and i
was shocked my spiritual eyes had opened
up like never before
and from there i learned that there is
more that jesus has actually provided
for us on the cross
and this is what i'm going to share with
you now since we are his true children
we qualify to share all his treasures
for indeed we are heirs of god himself
and since we are joined to christ we
also inherit all that he is and all that
he has you are a child of god
you have an inheritance
from
god
you inherit all that jesus is and all
that jesus has
wow when you stop to think about that
that's a lot and that is
heaven
heaven on earth
in jesus there is abundant life there is
healing there is freedom there is joy
there is
peace that's your inheritance
this is the thing many people do not
know that there's actually an
inheritance that jesus provided for you
on the cross
so when jesus went on the cross and he
shed blood and he was crucified he was
purchasing
something massive for you on that cross
there was such tremendous power in that
blood he purchased
a big inheritance for you for you to
receive freely as a gift from god by
grace through faith to receive this
today and to enjoy it and to be the
biggest light for jesus to the world to
show
look what life is like with jesus so now
what is this inheritance
this inheritance is it says the thief
comes only to steal and kill and destroy
but i jesus
have come that they may have life and
have it to the
full
he made this sacrifice on the cross
for you to have life to the full
life in abundance
this means
abundance in every area of your life
jesus did not say i've come that they
may have life and have it to the full in
this area in this area but maybe not
these areas he said
life to the full this means every single
area of your life
like this
health
abundant health
it says in isaiah 53 5 he was wounded
for our transgressions he was bruised
for our iniquities the chastisement for
our peace was upon him and by his
stripes we are healed stripes what does
that mean that means that jesus before
he even went on the cross he was
shedding blood for you before when there
was scourging that he was enduring he
endured much scourging scourging means
there was a whip there were sharp pieces
on the end of this whip
so that when jesus was whipped
it wasn't just lashes
but there was even
pieces of flesh coming out
he was shedding blood he was going
through that horrendous scourging
for you to have healing today
jesus was purchasing
healing for you when he endured that
scourging he did not do it for nothing
he did it for you to be healed of that
sickness of that disease he did it for
you to be freed
of any kind of oppression
that healing
is for every area of your body
your your mind your soul your heart
jesus has paid the price it says
by his stripes you are healed not maybe
you'll be healed
you are healed meaning this is part of
your inheritance it is your right from
god you the devil cannot argue it
it's like it's a contract clear and
writing jesus paid the price for my
healing i must be healed today because
of this contract
that jesus has signed here
healing's mine
this means physical healing this means
mental healing
this means emotional healing everything
these are not just words by his stripes
we are healed
this is the contract that you can show
the devil and say you cannot take my
healing
it's
illegal
this is mine and nobody can take it
jesus gave it to me and it belongs to me
another part of your inheritance is
protection john 10 28 says i gave them
eternal life and they shall never perish
no one will snatch them out of my hand
you do not need to be afraid of anything
when you give your life to jesus because
in your inheritance god has provided to
protect you that no one can take you
from his hand
you are in his
hands the bible says that the lord
directs the steps of the righteous man
or woman
so that means that he's literally
holding your hand
leading you step by step nobody can take
you out of god's hand
when you are really surrendered to god
when you are serving him
god let me tell you
wants you here on this earth for a long
time
to accomplish the purpose he has for you
because
the more that we here on this earth as
believers can do for god for the kingdom
of god the more souls will be saved and
the more the kingdom of darkness will be
destroyed
i grabbed hold of this revelation
and i don't fear anything anymore i can
be on airplanes there can be tons of
turbulence
i can get threats or whatever from
people
and i have no fear because
i have a supernatural protection from
god
the devil cannot pierce through that
protection from god that he has around
me
i know
i have
i have an assignment to accomplish on
this earth
and it's a lot that god has for me to do
and it's not going to take just one year
or two years it's going to take a while
he has lots for me to do
and so i know that god wants me to stay
here and he's going to make sure i
finish
what i was called to do on this earth
now this is why salvation is urgent
though because when you
have not given your life to jesus or
when you're not serious about
surrendering to jesus
you don't have that protection
this is this is one of the great joys of
surrendering to god you can't you never
have to fear about anyone harming you
about
dying you can have sickness and think
well
there's no way i'm gonna die from this
sickness because i know
i have a lot of things that i need to do
for god still that he called me to do
protection is part of your inheritance
supernatural protection from god is part
of your inheritance from jesus the next
part of your inheritance is provision
curse is the ground because of you
through painful toil you will eat from
it all the days of your life
there was a curse upon humanity before
jesus came so people would work they
would work hard
but
there was not favor upon their work and
it was the ground was cursed they they
would just work and work and it was
painful and they wouldn't get to reap
from their hard work
but jesus destroyed that curse
and now he he has given us an
inheritance of
supernatural provision from him abundant
provision now he blesses the work of
your hands
so when you work for jesus when you're
doing what he's called you to do and
maybe that's a mundane job maybe that's
your career where you're at right now
but god called you to do that
he's literally blessing the work of your
hands just as
moses had a staff in his hand it was
ordinary but when he used it for god's
will miracles happened through the works
of his hand
in the same way when you
are serving jesus surrender doing what
he's called you to do your work will be
blessed
you will reap there will be protection
over your finances
and there will be favor upon you my god
will supply every need of yours
according to his riches in glory in
christ
jesus
so because of jesus because of what he's
done now god will supply every need
and we we see this example of god saying
bring tithe into the storehouse and see
that i won't pour out so many blessings
for you that there's not even room in
your lap
for all the blessings he also says
what you sow you will reap if you sow
sparingly you will reap sparingly but if
you sow abundantly you'll reap
abundantly
so as long as you sow as long as you're
giving to the kingdom of god as long as
you're working at what god's called you
to do you'll never be in lack
you will have more than enough and there
will be favor upon your finances
in your inheritance there is also
peace
perfect peace i leave the gift of peace
with you my peace not the kind of
fragile peace given by the world but my
perfect peace don't yield to fear or be
troubled in your hearts instead be
courageous
so jesus is saying i have given you
perfect peace
he paid the price for you to have an
inheritance of perfect peace meaning
that there can be so much attack from
the devil in this world there can be
seasons where you're in the valley when
things are hard when you're going
through fire
when there's heartbreak when there's
loss when there's death
and just things happen but jesus has
paid a price on the cross for you to
literally always be in perfect peace
perfect peace means
it's not of this world peace of this
world means when things go good you have
peace but when things go bad you don't
have peace but perfect peace means that
no matter what highs or lows
there's a supernatural peace that jesus
has given to you and as you put your
eyes on jesus you will access that
perfect peace so whenever anxiety comes
in your mind you should know
no i have an inheritance of perfect
peace something's wrong here this must
go
because perfect peace has been given to
me it's my right to always have it
in this inheritance we also have
received the power of god living inside
of us if the spirit of him who raised
jesus from the dead dwells in you he who
raised christ jesus from the dead will
also give life to your mortal bodies
through his spirit who dwells in you
so when you give your life to jesus you
are no longer like normal humans in the
world without jesus
they are mere humans but you have become
a supernatural being
you are one with god who created the
whole universe holy spirit literally
lives inside of you and he's full of
power and so now you're living a
supernatural life this is the
inheritance this is part of the
inheritance that jesus is giving you
that you would have the holy spirit to
empower you throughout your days to do
anything empower you to have strength
empower you to have wisdom empower you
to have intellect empower you to do
anything you need to do
any kind of ability speak
you have
god partnering with you and giving you
his
power you have holy spirit in you to
speak to you to direct you to lead you
to true life every single day to lead
you out of harm's way you're living a
supernatural life one
with god
also jesus has provided authority over
the devil
he returned the authority that was lost
from adam and eve he returned it to you
so now
the devil does not have any kind of
authority over you you have authority
over the devil i have given you
authority to tremble on snakes and
scorpions and to overcome all the power
of the enemy
nothing will harm you
you have authority now over every attack
of the devil he's a liar and he wants to
make you think that he has authority but
that is a lie because he is the father
of lies the truth is
you have the authority it is part of
your inheritance that jesus has provided
for you
so he cannot get away with his lies he
cannot
force himself on you and force his way
and will on you you are the one that has
authority over him you
now have to execute it
this is the full gospel
there is so much of the gospel that many
in the body of christ have never heard i
know this because i was just this open
christian in many different christian
circles for 24 years of my life until
i heard the full gospel and hearing the
full gospel changed everything for me
when i heard the full gospel that began
my first step into receiving
abundant life from jesus and walking in
it i can tell you now
abundant life is more than possible i am
living proof i'm walking in it now
what you've just heard
this
really is what jesus has provided for
you
it is accessible to you
it is jesus wants it for you more than
anything he's already given all these
things to you healing freedom abundant
life provision
it is like this
it's like parents who
think so carefully about presents they
want to give their children on christmas
day and they
say they spend tons of money on it and
they wrap it up all beautiful and
they're they put the child's name on it
and they're so excited for them to open
the present that's like what jesus has
done he
purchased the most expensive gifts for
you
he did it just as a free gift for you
because he loves you so much
he's wrapped it up it's under the tree
and there's a name tag with your name on
it but you actually have to
look and see your name on it
acknowledge and accept that it's really
for you
from jesus because he loves you so much
and then you have to actually open it to
receive it
and then you actually have to cherish it
and value it to hold on to it to not
lose it this is for you it's right there
for you now ready for you to grab and
receive
revivals now and it's time for you to
receive this abundant life finally
that jesus may receive the reward of his
suffering he didn't suffer for nothing
it brings him the greatest joy for you
to actually receive
these gifts that he paid such a price
for it says as you go preach saying the
kingdom of heaven is at hand heal the
sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead
cast out demons freely you have received
freely give so jesus was telling the
disciples preach preach the gospel the
full gospel preach saying the kingdom of
heaven is at hand meaning
all that is in heaven it's here for you
now abundant life is here for you now
it's at hand so he was telling the
disciples preach this it's like what i'm
doing today letting you know it's here
for you this is what jesus has done for
you and then jesus says
and then after you preached heal the
sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead
cast out demons so in other words he's
like
after you shared what people can receive
now release it to them
now that they have faith
to receive this release it to them the
bible says my people perish because of
lack of knowledge many people are
perishing because of the lack of the
knowledge of the full gospel we receive
salvation by grace through faith
there are many people who are only
receiving part of the gospel because
that's the only part that they are aware
of and have faith in
so there are many christians living
powerless lives in lack sick and
oppressed they will go to heaven
because they believe in that they might
have a relationship with god here right
now because they believe in that
but they do not know about the rest of
the inheritance from jesus so they don't
have faith in it because they don't know
my people perish because of lack of
knowledge but the bible says you shall
know the truth and the truth shall set
you free
so here you know the truth today it's
time for you to believe in this truth so
you can be set free
and by the way this abundant life
that jesus has given us it's
it's not just selfishly for us like it's
not just like
this exciting news that we can have
abundant life now it's bigger than that
the more that we are walking in god's
abundant life
the more we are shining brightly for
jesus to the world we're the light of
the world and it's us being a light that
attracts the lost
it's not us
preaching partial gospel
and living in lack and bondage and
sickness
the world doesn't want that that's not
attracting how we are the light
how we are the biggest light we can be
is by preaching the full gospel and
living it out and showing people
testifying
this is what happens when you give your
life to jesus i was once sick but he
healed me i have abundant health now i
was once oppressed but he delivered me i
have perfect peace now
i was once in lack but i have abundance
in all areas god's opened up all these
doors there's favor upon my life
that's what will attract people to jesus
it's time to receive right now abundant
life
today
what you've heard this is step one for
you to hear that this is for you so you
can believe
so right now just say
i believe that by jesus's stripes i'm
healed i believe he leans mine i believe
freedom's mind say that right now
declare
abundance in my finances is mine
